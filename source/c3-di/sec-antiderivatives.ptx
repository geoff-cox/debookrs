	<title>Antiderivatives as Solutions</title>

	<p>
		You might not realize it, but every time you find an antiderivative of a function you are actually solving a differential equation! To clarify, suppose you are asked to compute the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		By the definition of antiderivative, you want a function whose derivative is <m>x^2</m>. In other words:
	</p>

	<sidebyside width="70%">
		<p>
			<q>Find <m>y</m> such that <m>\ \dfrac{d}{dx}\big[y(x)\big] = x^2\ </m> or <m>\ y'(x) = x^2\ </m></q>
		</p>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		However, this is precisely what it means to solve a differential equation and since the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>\sfrac{x^3}{3} + c</m>, we can conclude that the family of functions that satisfy the differential equation
		<me>
			y'(x) = x^2
		</me>	
		is given by the general solution:
		<me>
			y(x) = \frac{x^3}{3} + c
		</me>
		where <m>c</m> is any constant.
	</p>

	<!-- <aside>
		<title><m>f(x)</m> Meaning</title> 
		<p>
			<m>f(x)</m> is a placeholder for any expression containing <m>x</m>'s and constants, no <m>y</m>'s.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<assemblage>
		<title>Solutions as Antiderivates</title>
		<p>
			The general solution to any differential equation of the form
			<me>
				\dfrac{dy}{dx} = f(x)
			</me>
			where only the independent variable appears on the right side is given by
			<me>
				y(x) = F(x) + c
			</me>
			where <m>F(x)</m> is any antiderivative of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>c</m> is any constant.

						<p>
							This answer does not satify the differential equation. When you take the derivative of <m>y = x^3 - 7</m>, you get <m>\dfrac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2</m>, which is not equal to <m>x^3 - 7</m>.
