	<introduction>
		<p>
			Solving differential equations can be complex because there is no one-size-fits-all technique for solving them. The method used depends on the characteristics of the specific equation, such as its order and linearity. For instance, one of the first techniques that we will explore can only be applied to linear, first-order equations. Therefore, it's important to first ensure that the equation meets the requirements of the chosen technique before attempting to solve it. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

		<introduction> 
			<p>
				In some cases, differential equations can be solved by integrating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable. This approach, which we will refer to as <em>direct integration</em>, requires a specific form that allows integration to "remove" the derivatives from the dependent variable, providing direct access to the solution. Although it is rare to encounter equations that can be approached in this way, it serves as a great starting point for learning the solution process. This section will explain this concept and guide you through your first complete example of solving a differential equation from start to finish.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Antiderivatives </title>
			<p>
				When you find an antiderivative, you're actually solving a basic differential equation. For example, consider finding the general antiderivative of <m>x^2</m>. The calculus approach would compute the integral
				<me>
					\int x^2\ dx = \frac13 x^3 + c
				</me>.
				The differential equations approach, on the other hand, seeks all functions whose derivative is <m>x^2</m>. This means solving any of the following equivalent equations for <m>y</m>:
				<men xml:id="antiderivative-eqn">\frac{d}{dx}[y] = x^2, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2, \quad \text{or} \quad y^\prime = x^2</men>
			</p>
				
			<p>
				To solve for <m>y</m>, we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so:
				<md>
					<mrow> \int\frac{d}{dx}[y]\ dx	\amp = \int x^2\ dx				</mrow>
					<mrow> 					y + c_1	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2		</mrow>
					<mrow> 						y	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2-c_1 \quad \implies \quad y = \frac13 x^3 + c	</mrow>
				</md>
				where <m>c = c_2-c_1</m> is a constant.	Although this method might seem excessive for simple problems, it illustrates the core concept of isolating the dependent variable and expressing it in terms of the independent variable, <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<note><title>Combining Constants is very common in differential equations</title>
				Combining constants like we did above is a common practice in differential equations and is something you'll see often in this text.
			</note>

			<example xml:id="antiderivative-example">
					<m>\ \ </m> Solve the initial-value problem 
					<p>
						<me>2y' - 4\sin x = 2, \quad y(0) = 5 </me>.
					</p>
					
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						Start by isolating the derivative, <m>y'</m>, on one side of the equation
						<md>
							<mrow> y' \amp = 1 + 2 \sin x </mrow>.
						</md>
						Integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to leave us with <m>y</m> on the left side
						<md>
							<mrow> \int y'\ dx 	\amp = \int \left(1 + 2 \sin x\right) \ dx 				</mrow>
							<mrow> 	y + c_1 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + c_2 								</mrow>
							<mrow> 			y 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + \boxed{c_2 - c_1}\leftarrow c		</mrow>
							<mrow> 		y(x)	\amp  = x - 2 \cos x + c 								</mrow>.
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, apply the initial condition <m>y(0) = 5</m> to find <m>c</m>
						<md>
							<mrow> 				y(0)	\amp = 5 </mrow>
							<mrow> (0) - 2 \cos(0) + c	\amp = 5 </mrow>
							<mrow> 			0 - 2 + c	\amp = 5 </mrow>
							<mrow> 					c	\amp = 7 </mrow>.
						</md>
						Thus, the solution to the differential equation is <m>\quad y = x - 2 \cos x + 7 </m>.

			<p>
				As seen in the <xref ref="antiderivative-example" text="custom">previous example</xref>, if a differential equation can be written in the form:
				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx}[y] = f(x)
				</me>, 
				then the solution can be found by integrating both sides. This principle extends to more complex equations of the form:
				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x,y)\right] = f(x)
				</me>.
				Here, <m>f(x)</m> is a placeholder that indicates that <em>only</em> <m>x</m> variables can appear on the right-hand side of this equation. Similarly, <m>g(x,y)</m> indicates that <em>only</em> <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> variables can appear inside the derivative.
			</p>

			<p>
				This leads us to our first method for solving first-order differential equations—<em>direct integration</em>.
			</p>

			<exploration xml:id="direct-integration"><title> Direct Integration </title>
				<p>
					The general solution of a differential equation in the form
					<men xml:id="direct-integration-equation">
						\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x,y)\right] = f(x)
					</men>,
					can be determined by integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>.
				</p>
			</exploration> 

			<p>
				Consider the following examples to see how the same approach applies to these more interesting problems.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="direct-integration-example-1">
				<m>\ \ </m>	Find the particular solution to the differential equation
				<p>
					<me>

					</me>.
				</p>
				
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						In order to isolate <m>y</m>, we need to release it from the derivative by integrating both sides as before.
						<md>
							<mrow> \int \frac{d}{dx}\left[5x \cdot y\right]\ dx \amp = \int x^{-2}\ dx </mrow>
							<mrow> 5x \cdot y + c_1 \amp = -x^{-1} + c_2 </mrow>
							<mrow>  y \amp = \frac{1}{5x}\Big(-\frac{1}{x} + \overset{=\ c}{\overbrace{c_2 - c_1}}\Big) </mrow>
							<mrow>  y \amp = \frac{1}{5x}\left(-\frac{1}{x} + c\right) </mrow>
						</md>
						Finally, we use the condition, <m>y\left(1\right) = -4</m>, to find the particular solution.
						<md>
							<mrow>  -4 \amp = \frac{1}{5}\left(-1 + c\right) </mrow>
							<mrow>  -20 \amp = -1 + c </mrow>
							<mrow>  c \amp = -19 </mrow>
						</md>
						Therefore, the particular solution is
						<m>
							\quad \displaystyle y = \frac{1}{5x}\left(-\frac{1}{x} - 19\right)
						</m>.

	<chapter><title> Separation of Variables </title>
		<introduction> 
			<p>
				The next technique we will explore is the <em>separation of variables</em> method, a powerful tool for solving certain types of differential equations. The essence of this approach lies in the ability to isolate the dependent and independent variables on opposite sides of the equation. When this separation is possible, the equation is called <em>separable</em>, and we can solve it by integrating both sides independently.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter, we will delve into the process of identifying separable differential equations and the steps needed to rewrite them in a form suitable for separation. You'll learn how to apply the separation of variables method to find solutions, accompanied by practical examples that illustrate its effectiveness.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Separable Form </title>
			<p>
				The separation of variables method works when we can separate the dependent and independent variables by multiplication. Let's define this property formally.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="separable">
				<statement>
					A first-order differential equation is <term>separable</term> if it can be written in the <term>separable form</term>:
					<men xml:id="separable-form">\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y)</men>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				The notation <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(y)</m> are place-holders for expressions that only contain the variable <m>x</m> and the variable <m>y</m>, respectively. Equivalently, the definition could be written as
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \left(
				\begin{array}{c}
					\text{ONLY } x \text{ terms} \\
					\text{ and/or constants}\\
				\end{array} \right) \cdot \left(
				\begin{array}{c}
					\text{ONLY } y \text{ terms} \\
					\text{and/or constants}\\
				\end{array} \right),
				</me>
				but it is much easier to just write <m>f(x) \cdot g(y)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the following differential equations are separable:
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} = 6xy, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (x^2 + 1)(y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(y)\cos(x)
				</me>.
				Whereas the following differential equations are not separable:
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + y, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (x + y)(y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x - y)
				</me>.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> Special Separable Forms </title>
				
				<p>
					A differential equation can still be separable even if one or both of the variables, <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, do not appear in the equation. For example, the differential equation,
					<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 </me>
					is still separable since it can be written as 
					<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = (\underset{f(x)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} 1 }}) \cdot (\underset{g(y)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} y^2 }}) </me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Similarly, the following equations are also separable:
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 5, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = 15
					</me>.
				</p>
				
			</paragraphs>

			<p>
				Understanding the separable form of differential equations is crucial for effectively applying the separation of variables method. By recognizing when an equation can be expressed as a product of functions involving only the independent and dependent variables, you unlock a straightforward path to finding solutions.

				Many differential equations will not be handed to you in <xref ref="separable-form" text="custom">separable form</xref>, so various algebra techniques will be required to put the equations into this form. The following set of examples illustrate this idea.

						</me>
						First, we split <m>P</m> and <m>t</m> in the numerator and denominator, then use the rule above to separate the fraction, like so
						<me>
							\frac{dP}{dt}
							= \underset{not\ separated}{\underbrace{\frac{Pt}{P^2 + 1}}}

				<solution><title> <em>Attention to Detail</em> </title>
					<p>
						This is sort of a trick question to get you in the habit of checking the order of a differential equation. Since this DE is not first-order, <em>it is not separable</em>.
					</p>
				</solution>
				<solution><title> <em>Isolate the Derivative First</em> </title>
					<p>
						We see that this DE is first-order, so now we need to see if it can be rearranged in <xref ref="separable-form" text="custom">separable form</xref>. Isolating <m> \frac{ds}{dt} </m> we get
						<me> \frac{ds}{dt} = s + t </me>
						and it should be clear that there is no way to separate <m>t</m> and <m>s</m> by <em>multiplication</em>, and therefore this DE <em>is not separable</em>.
					</p>
				</solution>
				<solution><title> <em>Isolate, Simplify, &amp; Factor</em> </title>
					<p>
						As before, let's isolate <m>dy/dx</m> on the left side of the equation, like so
						<me>  x\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^2 - 10x^2y</me>
						<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}\left(6x^2 - 10x^2y\right) </me>
						<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x - 10xy. </me>
						Now that the derivative is isolated on the left, we attempt to separate the variables on the right. Factoring <m>2x</m> out of both terms gives
						<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \cdot \left( 3 - 5y \right) </me>
						and we see that the differential equation <em>is separable</em>.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						In general, there is more than one way to separate a differential equation. This example could have been separated in either of the following ways:
						<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = x \cdot ( 6 - 10y ), \qquad \frac{dy}{dx} = ( -2x )\cdot ( 5y - 3 ) </me>
						The only thing that matters is that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are separated.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Separation of Variables Method (SOV) </title>
			<p>
				We are now going to discuss the steps involved in the <em>separation of variables</em> method. In order to use this method, the differential equation must be first-order and be <xref ref="separable" text="custom">separable</xref>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Identifying a differential equation as first-order is as simple as observing the presence of a first derivative and no higher derivatives. In comparison, determining that an equation is separable is not always immediately apparent. Sometimes, it requires some algebra to rearrange the equation into a form where the method can be applied. 
			</p>

				<p>
					If a differential equation can be written in the separable form
					<me xml:id="sov-method-de">
						\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y)
					</me>,
					then the general solution can be determined through the steps below.
				</p>
				<dl>
					<li xml:id="sov-step-1"><title> Step 1: Separate </title>
						<p>
							<m>\ds \frac{1}{g(y)}\ dy = f(x)\ dx</m>
						</p>
					</li>
					<li xml:id="sov-step-2"><title> Step 2: Integrate </title>
						<p>
							<m>\ds \int \frac{1}{g(y)}\ dy = \int f(x) \ dx</m>

			<p>
				These problems serve as warm-up examples to familiarize you with the separation of variables method. You won't encounter any tricky algebra or calculus steps, allowing you to focus solely on the general steps needed to apply this technique. However, pay close attention to the new concept of "combining constants", as it will appear frequently throughout this course.

			<note><title>Common Pitfall: Don't Split Square Roots!</title>
			
				<p>
					In the first example, we found the general solution to
					<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\cos x}{y}</me>
					as <m>y(x) = \pm\sqrt{2\sin(x) + c}</m>. Some students are tempted to simplify this incorrectly, like so:

						<mrow> y(x) =\amp\ \pm\sqrt{2\sin(x)} + \sqrt{c} \quad \leftarrow \text{Error} </mrow>
						<mrow> y(x) =\amp\ \pm\sqrt{2\sin(x)} + c \quad \leftarrow \text{Incorrect} </mrow>

					The constant <m>c</m> must remain inside the square root, as this separation over addition or subtraction violates the square root's mathematical properties.

			<p>
				The following problems introduce initial conditions, allowing you to solve for specific solutions using the SOV method.

				<p>

					A. <m>\ \ds \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{\cos x}{y}, \quad y(0) = -5 </m>
				</p>

				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						From previous example, the general solution is
						<me>y(x) = \pm\sqrt{2\sin(x) + c}.</me>
						where the <m>\pm</m> sign means that the general solution includes both the positive and negative square roots. However, when finding a particular solution, only one applies. In this case, the initial condition <m>y(0) = -5</m> indicates that <m>y</m> is negative when <m>x = 0</m>. Therefore, the particular solution must come from the form containing the negative sign. Substituting the initial condition:
						<md>
							<mrow> -5 = -\sqrt{2\sin(0) + c} = -\sqrt{0 + c} = -\sqrt{c} </mrow>
							<mrow> 5 = \sqrt{c} \implies c = 25 </mrow>
						</md>
						Therefore, the solution to the initial-value problem is:
						<me>y(x) = -\sqrt{2\sin(x) + 25}</me>

						Note that there is no nice way to find <m>Q</m> explicitly. In these cases, it is ok to leave the general solution in this implicit form. We can still find <m>c</m> using initial condition. Recall, that <m>Q(0) = 0</m> means that when <m>t = 0</m>, <m>Q = 0</m>. Substituting these values in, we get
						<md>
							<mrow> 0^2 + 2e^0 = 0^2 + c </mrow>
							<mrow> 2 = c </mrow>
						</md>
						Therefore, the solution to the initial-valued problem is

				These examples demonstrate a range of techniques and complexities involved in solving separable differential equations. Depending on the form of the equation, the solution might be explicit or implicit, but the method of separation of variables remains a powerful tool for finding solutions to many types of differential equations.

						</statement>
			
						<solution><title> Solution </title>
							<p>
						We take time <m>t</m> in minutes, with <m>t = 0</m> corresponding to 5:00 PM We also assume (somewhat unrealistically) that at any instant the temperature <m>T(t)</m> of the roast is uniform throughout. We have <m>T(t) \lt A = 375</m>, <m>T(0)=50</m>, and <m>T(75) =125</m>.

								<mrow>			-\ln(375-T)=\amp kt+C</mrow>
							</md>
			
							Now <m>T(0)=50</m>, implies that <m>B = 325</m>, so <m>T(t) = 375-325e^{kt}</m>. We also know that <m>T = 125</m> when <m>t = 75</m>. Substitution of these values in the preceding equation yields
			
							<me> k=-\frac{1}{75}\ln\left(\frac{250}{325}\right)\approx 0.0035.</me>
			
							Hence we finally solve the equation
			
							<me>150=375-325e^{(-0.0035)t}</me>

								Separation of variables works by isolating all terms involving <m>y</m> to one side and all terms involving <m>x</m> to the other.

						</statement>
						<solution><title> Solution </title>

								For the method of separation of variables to be used, we must be able to write the differential equation in the form <m>g(y) dy = h(x) dx</m>, effectively separating the variables <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> onto different sides of the equation. When a differential equation can be written in this way, it is called separable.

	<chapter><title> Integrating Factor </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				This chapter introduces the next solution method called the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em> (IF method). This important technique solves any first-order linear differential equation using a reversed version of the product rule followed by direct integration.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Recall, the <em>Direct Integration method</em> provides a straightforward way to solve differential equations when the equation can be written in the form:
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y)] = f(x) </me>.
				In such cases, solving the equation is as simple as integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>. As you will see in the discussion that follow, the integrating factor method is essentially a direct integration problem in disguise. The difference here is that you must perform an initial step to rewrite the differential equation into a form for which direct integration applies.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The key idea is to multiply the differential equation by an integrating factor that simplifies it into a form that can be solved by direct integration. In the next sections, we will explore how this is done, step by step.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Product Rule </title>
			<p>
				The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. Since this rule is at the heart of the method, let's take a moment to review it and see how it helps transform a differential equation into one that can be directly integrated.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The product rule is used to compute the derivative of a product of two functions. In the context of solving first-order linear differential equations, we use the product rule in reverse to combine terms involving the dependent and independent variables. This allows us to rewrite the equation as the derivative of a product, making integration straightforward. Let's begin by recalling the two directions of the product rule.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions. The product rule states that
				<men xml:id="if-product-rule">
					\underset{\xrightarrow[\LARGE\text{forward}]{} }{\ds [f \cdot g ]'} = 
					\underset{\xleftarrow[\LARGE\text{backward}]{} }{\ds f \cdot g' + f' \cdot g}.
				</men>
				The <q>forward</q> version goes from left to right, while the <q>backward</q> version, which we'll focus on, goes from right to left. Let's practice applying both versions with a few examples.
			</p>
		
			<example>

				Finally, let's see what this looks like on an actual differential equation.

					Rewrite the left side of the equation in the form <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f \cdot g] </m>.
					<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-02-eq">
						\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
					</men>.
				</p>
		
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						As before, noticing <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> in different terms of
						<me>
							\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
						</me>
						immediately tells us that the left side can be rewritten as
						<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot y\ \big]' = 3x</me>
						and the observation that <m>[e^{5x^2}]' = 10xe^{5x^2}</m> gives us the other term. Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as
						<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ e^{5x^2} \cdot\ y \big]' = 3x</me>.
					</p>
		
					<p>
						Do you see that direct integration can be used here to solve the differential equation?
					</p>
				</solution>
		
			</example>
		
			<p>
				By understanding how the product rule works in both directions, we can transform a differential equation into one that is easy to solve through integration. This transformation is the core of the integrating factor method, which we will explore next.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Integrating Factor </title>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we introduced the idea of solving first-order linear differential equations by manipulating the equation into a form that allows direct integration. This process involved applying a <q>backward</q> product rule to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. However, most equations are not in the form to do this directly. Instead, there is a missing piece, called the <em>integrating factor</em> that is required for transformation to take place and is the focus of this section.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				To see this <q>missing</q> piece, lets consider the differential equation:
				<men xml:id="if-example-eqn"> 
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
				</men>.
				We would like to apply the backward product rule to the left side, but it seems to be missing something. Let's try to figure out what this missing piece is by multipying both sides by something:
				<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-w-missing-piece">
					\us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}\frac{dy}{dx} + 2\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}\ y = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}
				</men>.
				With this missing piece and the fact that <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> appear in the equation, we should be able to rewrite the equation as:
				<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece">
					\frac{d}{dx} \Big[\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}} \cdot y\ \Big] = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}
				</men>.
				To determine what this missing piece is, we need to see where <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> (start) and <xref ref="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece"/> (goal) meet in the middle. This is shown below.
				<sidebyside widths="45% 55%" valign="middle">
					<p>
						Notice, the two middle equations agree everywhere except for the expressions in blue. In order for the start and goal equations to be the same, these expressions must match. In other words, the piece that we need to get <xref ref="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece"/> must satisfy
						<me> 
							{\color{blue} \frac{d\ \boxed{\phantom{|P}}}{dx} = 2\ \boxed{\phantom{|P}}} 
						</me>.
						But, this is the differential equation
						<me>
							\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \mu
						</me>
						where <m>\mu</m> is the unknown!
					</p>
					<p>
						<image source="figures/IF-Idea-GIF-1-repeat.gif" width="100%">
							<shortdescription>(for accessibility)</shortdescription>
						</image>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Solving this requires you to notice that it is separable and a <xref ref="if-intro-example-details" text="custom">quick calculation</xref> shows that <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m> is the solution. Therefore, if you multiply both sides of <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> by <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, you can use the backward product rule to write the equation as
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ e^{2x} \cdot y \right] = 5e^{2x} </me>,
				which can then be solved by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				The function, <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, that allowed us to rewrite the equation is called the <em>integrating factor</em> and it is derived by solving a simple separable equation based on the coefficient of the dependent variable in the differential equation. Once the integrating factor is found, it allows us to rewrite the equation into a form that is straightforward to solve.
			</p>
		
			<theorem xml:id="integrating-factor"><title>The Integrating Factor</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						The <term>integrating factor</term> for the first-order linear differential equation

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
			<p>
				The integrating factor method provides a systematic approach to solving first-order linear differential equations. These equations can be written in the <em>standard form</em> as:
				<fn>
					<p>
						A general linear differential equation looks like:
						<me> 
							a_n(x)y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
						</me>.
						The first-order case simplifies to:
						<me> 
							a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
						</me>,
						By dividing through by <m>a_1(x)</m>, this reduces to:
						<me>
							y' + \us{P(x)}{\ub{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \us{Q(x)}{\ub{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}
						</me>.
						This form is called the **standard form** of a first-order linear differential equation:
						<me> 
							y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
						</me>.
					</p>
				</fn>
				<men xml:id="if-standard-form"> 
					y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
				</men>.
				The key to solving such equations lies in finding an <xref ref="integrating-factor" text="custom">integrating factor</xref> that simplifies the left-hand side of the equation into a form that can be solve via <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now that we've introduced the integrating factor method, let's break down the step-by-step process:
			</p>
		
			<exploration xml:id="if-method"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
				<p>
					Here's the procedure for solving a first-order linear differential equation:
				
					<dl width="narrow">
						<li xml:id="if-step-1"><title> Get the Standard Form &amp; Identify <m>P</m> </title>
							<m>
								\ds\hspace{8.5em}\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x)
							</m>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="if-step-2"><title> Find the Integrating Factor <m>\mu</m> </title>
							<m>
								\ds\hspace{8.5em}\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}
							</m>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="if-step-3"><title> Multiply the Equation by <m>\mu</m> &amp; Reverse the Product Rule </title>
							<md>
								<mrow> \mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x) P(x) y 			=\amp\ \mu(x) Q(x)	</mrow>
								<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}\left[\mu(x)\cdot y\right] 		=\amp\ \mu(x) Q(x) 	</mrow>

							</m>
						</li>
					</dl>
				</p>
			</exploration> 
		
			<p>
				Now that we've laid out the method, let's apply it to some concrete examples. In each case, we will follow the four steps outlined above: (1) put the equation into standard form, (2) compute the integrating factor, (3) multiply the equation and simplify using the product rule, and (4) integrate to find the solution.

				The integrating factor method is a versatile tool for solving first-order linear differential equations. By reducing the equation to a form that allows for direct integration, we can tackle a wide variety of problems with confidence. The examples in this chapter illustrate the broad applicability of this technique, and practice with a range of equations will solidify your understanding of how to use it effectively.

						First we put DE in standard form for a first-order linear DE <m> \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x), </m> so we can identify <m> \ds P(x). </m> ...EXCEPT for this DE, the roles of <m> \ds x </m> and <m> \ds y </m> are switched. Notice that here <m> \ds y </m> is the independent variable and <m> \ds x </m> is the dependent variable.  So we will aim for the standard for <m> \ds \frac{dx}{dy} + P(y)x = f(y), </m> and we want to identify <m> \ds P(y). </m>
