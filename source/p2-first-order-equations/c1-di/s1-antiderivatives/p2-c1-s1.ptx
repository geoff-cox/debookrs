	<p>
		When you find an antiderivative, you're actually solving a basic differential equation. For example, consider finding the general antiderivative of <m>x^2</m>. The calculus approach would compute the integral
		<me>
			\int x^2\ dx = \frac13 x^3 + c
		</me>.
		The differential equations approach, on the other hand, seeks all functions whose derivative is <m>x^2</m>. This means solving any of the following equivalent equations for <m>y</m>:
		<men xml:id="antiderivative-eqn">\frac{d}{dx}[y] = x^2, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2, \quad \text{or} \quad y^\prime = x^2</men>
	</p>
		
	<p>
		To solve for <m>y</m>, we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so:
		<md>
			<mrow> \int\frac{d}{dx}[y]\ dx	\amp = \int x^2\ dx				</mrow>
			<mrow> 					y + c_1	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2		</mrow>
			<mrow> 						y	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2-c_1 \quad \implies \quad y = \frac13 x^3 + c	</mrow>
		</md>
		where <m>c = c_2-c_1</m> is a constant.	Although this method might seem excessive for simple problems, it illustrates the core concept of isolating the dependent variable and expressing it in terms of the independent variable, <m>x</m>.
	</p>

	<note><title>Combining Constants is very common in differential equations</title>
		Combining constants like we did above is a common practice in differential equations and is something you'll see often in this text.

	<example xml:id="antiderivative-example">
			<m>\ \ </m> Solve the initial-value problem 
			<p>
				<me>2y' - 4\sin x = 2, \quad y(0) = 5 </me>.
			</p>
			
		<solution>
			
			<p>
				Start by isolating the derivative, <m>y'</m>, on one side of the equation
				<md>
					<mrow> y' \amp = 1 + 2 \sin x </mrow>.
				</md>
				Integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to leave us with <m>y</m> on the left side
				<md>
					<mrow> \int y'\ dx 	\amp = \int \left(1 + 2 \sin x\right) \ dx 				</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y + c_1 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + c_2 								</mrow>
					<mrow> 			y 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + \fbox{\(c_2 - c_1\)}\leftarrow c	</mrow>
					<mrow> 		y(x)	\amp  = x - 2 \cos x + c 								</mrow>.
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, apply the initial condition <m>y(0) = 5</m> to find <m>c</m>
				<md>
					<mrow> 				y(0)	\amp = 5 </mrow>
					<mrow> (0) - 2 \cos(0) + c	\amp = 5 </mrow>
					<mrow> 			0 - 2 + c	\amp = 5 </mrow>
					<mrow> 					c	\amp = 7 </mrow>.
				</md>
				Thus, the solution to the differential equation is <m>\quad y = x - 4 \cos x + 7 </m>.
			</p>
