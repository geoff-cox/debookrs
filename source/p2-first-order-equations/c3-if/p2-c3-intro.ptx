		Recall, the <em>Direct Integration method</em> provides a straightforward way to solve differential equations when the equation can be written in the form:
		<me> \frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y)] = f(x) </me>.
		In such cases, solving the equation is as simple as integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>. It turns out that all first-order linear differential equations can be put into this form, but getting them into this form can be tricky. This is where the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em> (IF method) comes in as it outlines the steps required to <q>prepare</q> the equation for direct integration.
