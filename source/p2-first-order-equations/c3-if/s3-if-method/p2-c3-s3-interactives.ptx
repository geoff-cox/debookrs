				<em>Why is it important to put the differential equation in standard form before using the integrating factor method?</em>
			</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>
					<p>
						It allows us to easily identify the coefficient of <m>y</m> and compute the integrating factor.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The standard form highlights <m>P(x)</m>, which is needed to calculate the integrating factor.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It makes it easier to find the general solution directly without using integration.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The standard form doesn't eliminate the need for integration; it helps set up the equation for the integrating factor method.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It ensures the differential equation has a unique solution.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Putting the equation in standard form does not guarantee uniqueness; that depends on initial conditions.</feedback>

			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It reduces the degree of the differential equation, making it easier to solve.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The standard form doesn't reduce the degree of the equation but helps organize terms for applying the integrating factor.</feedback>
