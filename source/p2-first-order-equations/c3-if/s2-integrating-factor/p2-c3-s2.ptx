<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Integrating Factor </title>

	<p>
		As revealed in the previous section, the integrating factor method aims to rewrite a differential equation so that direct integration can be used to solve it. We also saw that this is accomplished by applying a <q>backward</q> product rule to the left side of the equation. Unfortunately, the left side of the equation is usually missing a piece that is required for the backward product rule to apply. This missing piece is called the <em>integrating factor</em> and it is the focus of the current discussion.
	</p>

	<p>
		To see this <q>missing</q> piece, lets consider the differential equation:
		<men xml:id="if-example-eqn"> 
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
		</men>.
		We would like to apply the backward product rule to the left side, but it seems to be missing something. Let's try to figure out what this missing piece is by multipying both sides by something:
		<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-w-missing-piece">
			\us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}}\frac{dy}{dx} + 2\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}}\ y = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}}
		</men>.
		With this missing piece and the fact that <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> appear in the equation, we should be able to rewrite the equation as:
		<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece">
			\frac{d}{dx} \Big[\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}} \cdot y\ \Big] = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}}
		</men>.
		To determine what this missing piece is, we need to see where <xref ref="if-example-eqn-w-missing-piece"/> and <xref ref="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece"/> meet in the middle.

					Notice that the two middle equations agree everywhere except for the expressions in blue. Therefore, in order for the start and goal equation to be the same, we need to find the function that goes in <m>{\color{blue} \boxed{\phantom{|P}}} </m> such that,
					<me> {\color{blue} \frac{d\ \boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}}{dx} = 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\Large |P}}} </me>.
					But, this is separable differential equation, <m>\ds\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\ \mu,</m>
					where <m>\mu</m> is the unknown!

	<p>
		So, to find the missing piece, we solve the separable differential equation 
		<me>\ds\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\ \mu</me>
		for <m>\mu</m>. In this case, the solution is <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m> and this is exactly what goes in all the boxes above to rewrite <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> as
		<me> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ e^{2x} \cdot y \right] = 5e^{2x} </me>,
		which can be solved by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The missing piece, <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, is called the <em>integrating factor</em> for equation <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> and the general form of the integrating factor is found in a similar way, as we will show now. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Note, all first-order linear differential equations can be written in the form:
		<men xml:id="if-general-eqn"> 
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x)
		</men>,
		where <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> are functions of <m>x</m>. Just as above, the goal is to write the left-side as a single derivative. However, backward product rule is missing a piece, <m>\mu(x)</m>, that we still need to find. We find <m>\mu(x)</m> by multiplying it onto <xref ref="if-general-eqn"/>, like so
