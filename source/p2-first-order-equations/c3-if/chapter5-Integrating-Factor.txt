<chapter><title> Integrating Factor </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			This chapter introduces the next solution method called the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em> (IF method). This important technique solves any first-order linear differential equation using a reversed version of the product rule followed by direct integration.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Recall, the <em>Direct Integration method</em> provides a straightforward way to solve differential equations when the equation can be written in the form:
			<me> \frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y)] = f(x) </me>.
			In such cases, solving the equation is as simple as integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>. As you will see in the discussion that follow, the integrating factor method is essentially a direct integration problem in disguise. The difference here is that you must perform an initial step to rewrite the differential equation into a form for which direct integration applies.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			The key idea is to multiply the differential equation by an integrating factor that simplifies it into a form that can be solved by direct integration. In the next sections, we will explore how this is done, step by step.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Product Rule </title>
		<p>
			The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. Since this rule is at the heart of the method, let's take a moment to review it and see how it helps transform a differential equation into one that can be directly integrated.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			The product rule is used to compute the derivative of a product of two functions. In the context of solving first-order linear differential equations, we use the product rule in reverse to combine terms involving the dependent and independent variables. This allows us to rewrite the equation as the derivative of a product, making integration straightforward. Let's begin by recalling the two directions of the product rule.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions. The product rule states that
			<men xml:id="if-product-rule">
				\underset{\xrightarrow[\LARGE\text{forward}]{} }{\ds [f \cdot g ]'} = 
				\underset{\xleftarrow[\LARGE\text{backward}]{} }{\ds f \cdot g' + f' \cdot g}.
			</men>
			The <q>forward</q> version goes from left to right, while the <q>backward</q> version, which we'll focus on, goes from right to left. Let's practice applying both versions with a few examples.
		</p>
	
		<example>
	
			<m>\ \ </m> Compute each derivative.

									Trial and error with different combinations of <m>e^x, \sin x, </m> and <m>\cos x</m> inside <m>\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</m> is one approach, but a little thought should lead you to the answer

							<solution><title> Solution </title>
								<p>
									It may help to first rewrite the expression as
									<me>
										\mu \cdot\frac{1}{x} + \mu' \ln x
									</me>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Since <m>\mu</m> and <m>\mu'</m> appear in different terms, you know 
									<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</me>
									and since <m>[\ln x]' = 1/x</m>, we must have
									<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \ln x \ \big]'</me>.
								</p>
							</solution>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
	
		</example>
	
		<p>
			Finally, let's see what this looks like on an actual differential equation.
		</p>
	
		<example>
		
			<m>\ \ </m> Rewrite the left side of the equation in the form <m>\frac{d}{dx}[f \cdot g] </m>.
	
			<p>
				<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-02-eq">
					\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
				</men>.
			</p>
	
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
	
				<p>
					As before, noticing <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> in different terms of
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
					</me>
					immediately tells us that the left side can be rewritten as
					<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot y\ \big]' = 3x</me>
					and the observation that <m>[e^{5x^2}]' = 10xe^{5x^2}</m> gives us the other term. Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as
					<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ e^{5x^2} \cdot\ y \big]' = 3x</me>.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Do you see that direct integration can be used here to solve the differential equation?
				</p>
				
			</solution>
	
		</example>
	
		<p>
			By understanding how the product rule works in both directions, we can transform a differential equation into one that is easy to solve through integration. This transformation is the core of the integrating factor method, which we will explore next.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Integrating Factor </title>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we introduced the idea of solving first-order linear differential equations by manipulating the equation into a form that allows direct integration. This process involved applying a <q>backward</q> product rule to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. However, most equations are not in the form to do this directly. Instead, there is a missing piece, called the <em>integrating factor</em> that is required for transformation to take place and is the focus of this section.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			To see this <q>missing</q> piece, lets consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="if-example-eqn"> 
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
			</men>.
			We would like to apply the backward product rule to the left side, but it seems to be missing something. Let's try to figure out what this missing piece is by multipying both sides by something:
			<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-w-missing-piece">
				\us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}\frac{dy}{dx} + 2\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}\ y = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}
			</men>.
			With this missing piece and the fact that <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> appear in the equation, we should be able to rewrite the equation as:
			<men xml:id="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece">
				\frac{d}{dx} \Big[\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}} \cdot y\ \Big] = 5\ \us{?}{\boxed{\phantom{\large |P}}}
			</men>.
			To determine what this missing piece is, we need to see where <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> (start) and <xref ref="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece"/> (goal) meet in the middle. This is shown below.
			<sidebyside widths="45% 55%" valign="middle">
				<p>
					Notice, the two middle equations agree everywhere except for the expressions in blue. In order for the start and goal equations to be the same, these expressions must match. In other words, the piece that we need to get <xref ref="if-example-eqn-goal-w-missing-piece"/> must satisfy
					<me> 
						{\color{blue} \frac{d\ \boxed{\phantom{|P}}}{dx} = 2\ \boxed{\phantom{|P}}} 
					</me>.
					But, this is the differential equation
					<me>
						\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \mu
					</me>
					where <m>\mu</m> is the unknown!
				</p>
				<p>
					<image source="figures/IF-Idea-GIF-1-repeat.gif" width="100%">
						<shortdescription>(for accessibility)</shortdescription>
					</image>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Solving this requires you to notice that it is separable and a <xref ref="if-intro-example-details" text="custom">quick calculation</xref> shows that <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m> is the solution. Therefore, if you multiply both sides of <xref ref="if-example-eqn"/> by <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, you can use the backward product rule to write the equation as
			<me> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ e^{2x} \cdot y \right] = 5e^{2x} </me>,
			which can then be solved by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>. 
		</p>
	
		<p>
			The function, <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, that allowed us to rewrite the equation is called the <em>integrating factor</em> and it is derived by solving a simple separable equation based on the coefficient of the dependent variable in the differential equation. Once the integrating factor is found, it allows us to rewrite the equation into a form that is straightforward to solve.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
		<p>
			The integrating factor method provides a systematic approach to solving first-order linear differential equations. These equations can be written in the <em>standard form</em> as:
			<fn>
				<p>
					A general linear differential equation looks like:
					<me> 
						a_n(x)y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
					</me>.
					The first-order case simplifies to:
					<me> 
						a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
					</me>,
					By dividing through by <m>a_1(x)</m>, this reduces to:
					<me>
						y' + \us{P(x)}{\ub{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \us{Q(x)}{\ub{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}
					</me>.
					This form is called the **standard form** of a first-order linear differential equation:
					<me> 
						y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
					</me>.
				</p>
			</fn>
			<men xml:id="if-standard-form"> 
				y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
			</men>.
			The key to solving such equations lies in finding an <xref ref="integrating-factor" text="custom">integrating factor</xref> that simplifies the left-hand side of the equation into a form that can be solve via <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Now that we've introduced the integrating factor method, let's break down the step-by-step process:
		</p>
	
		<exploration xml:id="if-method"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
			<p>
				Here's the procedure for solving a first-order linear differential equation:
			
				<dl width="narrow">

						</m>
					</li>
					<li xml:id="if-step-2"><title> Find the Integrating Factor <m>\mu</m> </title>
						<m>
							\ds\hspace{8.5em}\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}
						</m>
					</li>
					<li xml:id="if-step-3"><title> Multiply the Equation by <m>\mu</m> &amp; Reverse the Product Rule </title>
						<md>
							<mrow> \mu(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x) P(x) y 			=\amp\ \mu(x) Q(x)	</mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}\left[\mu(x)\cdot y\right] 		=\amp\ \mu(x) Q(x) 	</mrow>

						</m>
					</li>
				</dl>
			</p>
		</exploration> 
	
		<p>
			Now that we've laid out the method, let's apply it to some concrete examples. In each case, we will follow the four steps outlined above: (1) put the equation into standard form, (2) compute the integrating factor, (3) multiply the equation and simplify using the product rule, and (4) integrate to find the solution.

						First we note that this DE is already in standard form for a first-order linear DE, <m> \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x), </m> with <m> \ds P(x) = -1. </m>  Then we find the integrating factor <m> \ds z. </m>

						Now we multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.

						</md>
						Now we recall the product rule for derivatives: <m> \ds \frac{d}{dx}\Big( f\cdot g \Big) = f\cdot g' + f' \cdot g. </m> We note that the two terms on the left hand side of equation (\ref{eq1}) are the result of taking the derivative of the product.  Hence we can undo the product rule as follows: <m> \ds\frac{d}{dx}\Big(e^{-x}\cdot y \Big) = e^{2x}.</m> Now we can integrate both sides of the equation and then solve for the dependent variable.

					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						First we put DE in standard form for a first-order linear DE <m> \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x), </m> so we can identify <m> \ds P(x). </m>
						<md>
							<mrow>  \frac{dy}{dx}	 \amp =  \frac{y}{x} + 2x + 1 </mrow>

						Thus, <m> \ds P(x) = - \frac{1}{x}. </m>  Then we find the integrating factor <m> \ds z. </m>

							<mrow>   \amp =  e^{\mbox{\Big(an antiderivative of <m> \ds -\frac{1}{x} </m> }\Big)} </mrow>
							<mrow>   \amp =  e^{-\ln|x|} </mrow>

							<mrow>   \amp =  \frac{1}{x} \mbox{ (since <m> \ds x>0 </m> )}  </mrow>
						</md>
						Now we multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.
						<md>
							<mrow>  \frac{1}{x}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{1}{x}\cdot \left(- \frac{1}{x}\right)y  \amp =  \frac{1}{x}(2x + 1) \nonumber </mrow>
							<mrow>  \frac{1}{x}\cdot\frac{dy}{dx} + \left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right)\cdot y  \amp =  2 + \frac{1}{x} \nonumber </mrow>
							<mrow>  \underbrace{\frac{1}{x}}_{f}\cdot\underbrace{\frac{dy}{dx}}_{g'} + \underbrace{\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right)}_{f'}\cdot \underbrace{y}_{g}  \amp =  2 + \frac{1}{x} \label{eq2}  </mrow>
						</md>
						Now we recall the product rule for derivatives: <m> \ds \frac{d}{dx}\Big( f\cdot g \Big) = f\cdot g' + f' \cdot g. </m> We note that the two terms on the left hand side of equation (\ref{eq2}) are the result of taking the derivative of the product.  Hence we can undo the product rule as follows: <m> \ds\frac{d}{dx}\Big(\frac{1}{x}\cdot y \Big) = 2 + \frac{1}{x}.</m> Now we can integrate both sides of the equation and then solve for the dependent variable.

						First we put DE in standard form for a first-order linear DE <m> \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x), </m> so we can identify <m> \ds P(x). </m>  Notice that for this DE <m> \ds \theta </m> is the independent variable (i.e., it is like the <m> \ds x </m> ) and <m> \ds r </m> is the dependent variable (i.e., it is like the <m> \ds y </m> ).  Hence the standard form we will aim for is <m> \ds \frac{dr}{d\theta} + P(\theta)r = f(\theta), </m> and we want to identify <m> \ds P(\theta). </m>
