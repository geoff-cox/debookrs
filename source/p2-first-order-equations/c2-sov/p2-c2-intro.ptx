		The next technique we will explore is the <em>separation of variables</em> method, a powerful tool for solving certain types of differential equations. The essence of this approach lies in the ability to isolate the dependent and independent variables on opposite sides of the equation. When this separation is possible, the equation is called <em>separable</em>, and we can solve it by integrating both sides independently.

		In this chapter, we will delve into the process of identifying separable differential equations and the steps needed to rewrite them in a form suitable for separation. Youâ€™ll learn how to apply the separation of variables method to find solutions, accompanied by practical examples that illustrate its effectiveness.
