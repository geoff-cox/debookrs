            <p><em>Why is it important to verify if a differential equation is separable?</em></p>
        </statement>
        <choices>
            <choice>
                <statement>Separable equations are easier to solve.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. While separable equations can be easier to solve, the main reason to verify separability is to ensure that the separation of variables method can be applied.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>It helps to identify the order of the differential equation.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Verifying separability does not necessarily relate to identifying the order of the differential equation.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>It simplifies the differential equation.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Verifying separability does not simplify the equation itself but confirms if the equation can be solved by separation of variables.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>Not all differential equations are separable, and this method only works on separable equations.</statement>
                <feedback>Correct! The separation of variables method is only applicable to separable differential equations, making it important to verify separability first.</feedback>

        </statement>
        <choices>
            <choice>
                <statement>The differential equation must be linear and separable.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation does not need to be linear.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>The differential equation must be first-order and linear.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. First-order is required, but the equation does not need to be linear for the separation of variables method to be applied.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>The differential equation must be second-order and separable.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation cannot be second-order for the separation of variables method to be applied.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>The differential equation must be first-order and separable.</statement>
                <feedback>Correct! The separation of variables method applies only to first-order differential equations thatare separable.</feedback>

            <p><em>Which of the following is the correct sequence of steps in the separation of variables method?</em></p>
        </statement>
        <choices>
            <choice>
                <statement>Integrate, Separate, Isolate and Combine Constants</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Integration comes after separating the variables, not before.</feedback>

            <choice>
                <statement>Isolate, Integrate, Separate, and Combine Constants</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Isolation is typically the final step, not the first.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>Separate, Differentiate, Isolate and Combine Constants</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Differentiation is not part of the separation of variables method; integration is the key step.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>Separate, Integrate, Isolate and Combine Constants</statement>
                <feedback>Correct! The correct sequence is to first separate the variables, then integrate, and finally isolate the dependent variable and combine constants.</feedback>

        </statement>
        <choices>
            <choice>
                <statement>Because the equation is nonlinear and must be separated.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. The equation is linear, but the method is applied for consistency and verification.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>To verify that the solution method yields the correct general solution.</statement>

            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>Because the equation is second-order and requires separation.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. The equation is first-order, not second-order.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>Because the equation involves trigonometric functions.</statement>

        <statement>
            <p><em>When solving a separable differential equation, why is it important to combine constants?</em></p>
        </statement>
        <choices>
           <choice>
                <statement>To ensure the solution is exact and matches initial conditions.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. While combining constants simplifies the solution, it doesn't directly relate to matching initial conditions.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>To eliminate any arbitrary constants from the solution.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Combining constants doesn't eliminate them but rather simplifies them into one term.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>To simplify the solution by reducing multiple constants into a single constant.</statement>
                <feedback>Correct! Combining constants simplifies the final solution and avoids unnecessary complexity.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice>
                <statement>To convert the solution into a standard form for easier interpretation.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. While combining constants can lead to a simpler form, the main purpose is to avoid having multiple constants when one will suffice.</feedback>

            <choice>
                <statement>Integrating both sides immediately.</statement>

                <statement>Substituting a value for <m>x</m>.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. Substitution is not part of the separation process; the goal is to separate the variables first.</feedback>

            <choice>
                <statement>Expanding the terms on both sides.</statement>
