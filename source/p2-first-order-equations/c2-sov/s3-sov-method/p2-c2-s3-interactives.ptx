			<p><em>Why is it important to verify if a differential equation is separable?</em></p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>Separable equations are easier to solve.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. While separable equations can be easier to solve, the main reason to verify separability is to ensure that the separation of variables method can be applied.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>It helps to identify the order of the differential equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Verifying separability does not necessarily relate to identifying the order of the differential equation.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>It simplifies the differential equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Verifying separability does not simplify the equation itself but confirms if the equation can be solved by separation of variables.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>Not all differential equations are separable, and this method only works on separable equations.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The separation of variables method is only applicable to separable differential equations, making it important to verify separability first.</feedback>

			<p><em>What are the two key requirements for using the separation of variables method?</em></p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>The differential equation must be linear and separable.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation does not need to be linear.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>The differential equation must be first-order and linear.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. First-order is required, but the equation does not need to be linear for the separation of variables method to be applied.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>The differential equation must be second-order and separable.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation cannot be second-order for the separation of variables method to be applied.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>The differential equation must be first-order and separable.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The separation of variables method applies only to first-order differential equations thatare separable.</feedback>
			</choice>

	<exercise label="p2-c2-s3-i6"><title> <em>In the differential equation <m>\ds\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{x}{y^2} = 0</m>, which step is crucial for verifying that it is separable?</em> </title>
		<statement>
			<p><em>In the differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{x}{y^2} = 0</m>, which step is crucial for verifying that it is separable?</em></p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>Integrating both sides immediately.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Integration should come after the equation is verified to be separable.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>Substituting a value for <m>x</m>.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Substitution is not part of the separation process; the goal is to separate the variables first.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>Expanding the terms on both sides.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Expansion is not necessary here; the focus should be on separating the variables.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>Rearranging the equation to isolate <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> and separate the variables.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! Rearranging the equation is key to verifying that it can be separated into functions of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>.</feedback>
