	<p>
		The separation of variables method works when we can separate the dependent and independent variables by multiplication. Let's define this property formally.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="separable">
		<statement>
			A first-order differential equation is <term>separable</term> if it can be written in the <term>separable form</term>:
			<men xml:id="separable-form">\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y)</men>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		The notation <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(y)</m> are place-holders for expressions that only contain the variable <m>x</m> and the variable <m>y</m>, respectively. Equivalently, the definition could be written as
		<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			\text{ONLY } x \text{ terms} \\
			\text{ and/or constants}\\
		\end{array} \right) \cdot \left(
		\begin{array}{c}
			\text{ONLY } y \text{ terms} \\
			\text{and/or constants}\\
		\end{array} \right),
		</me>
		but it is much easier to just write <m>f(x) \cdot g(y)</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the following differential equations are separable:
		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} = 6xy, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (x^2 + 1)(y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \sin(y)\cos(x)
		</me>.
		Whereas the following differential equations are not separable:
		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + y, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (x + y)(y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \cos(x - y)
		</me>.
	</p>

	<paragraphs><title> Special Separable Forms </title>
		
		<p>
			A differential equation can still be separable even if one or both of the variables, <m>x</m> or <m>y</m>, do not appear in the equation. For example, the differential equation,
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 </me>
			is still separable since it can be written as 
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = (\underset{f(x)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} 1 }}) \cdot (\underset{g(y)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} y^2 }}) </me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Similarly, the following equations are also separable:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x + 5, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = (y - 6)^3, \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = 15
			</me>.
		</p>
		
	</paragraphs>

	<p>
		Understanding the separable form of differential equations is crucial for effectively applying the separation of variables method. By recognizing when an equation can be expressed as a product of functions involving only the independent and dependent variables, you unlock a straightforward path to finding solutions.
