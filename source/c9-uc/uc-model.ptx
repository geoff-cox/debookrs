	<title>Modeling Forced Systems with Undetermined Coefficients</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			When a system is subjected to external forcing, the differential equation becomes nonhomogeneous. The method of undetermined coefficients allows us to find particular solutions when the forcing function has a special form. These forced systems exhibit both transient and steady-state behavior.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we'll model a driven mechanical oscillator and explore the phenomenon of resonance—one of the most important concepts in engineering and physics.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection>
		<title>The Problem: Resonance in Bridges and Buildings</title>

		<p>
			When soldiers march across a bridge in lockstep, their synchronized footsteps create a periodic driving force. If the frequency of their steps matches the bridge's natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillation can grow dangerously large—a phenomenon called resonance.
		</p>

		<p>
			How can we predict when resonance will occur and how severe it will be?
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Assumptions</title>

		<ul>
			<li>The system behaves as a linear spring-mass-damper.</li>
			<li>The external force is periodic: <m>F(t) = F_0\cos(\omega t)</m>.</li>
			<li>Damping is present but may be small.</li>
			<li>Parameters remain constant.</li>
		</ul>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Building the Model</title>

		<p>
			The equation of motion with external forcing is:
			<me>
				m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_0\cos(\omega t)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			In standard form:
			<me>
				\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + 2\zeta\omega_0\frac{dx}{dt} + \omega_0^2 x = \frac{F_0}{m}\cos(\omega t)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			where:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><m>\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m}</m>: natural frequency</li>
			<li><m>\zeta = \frac{c}{2\sqrt{km}}</m>: damping ratio</li>
			<li><m>\omega</m>: driving frequency</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<term>General Solution Structure:</term>
		</p>
		<me>
			x(t) = x_h(t) + x_p(t)
		</me>
		<ul>
			<li><m>x_h(t)</m>: homogeneous solution (transient, dies out due to damping)</li>
			<li><m>x_p(t)</m>: particular solution (steady-state response)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<term>Steady-State Solution:</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			Using undetermined coefficients, the particular solution has the form:
			<me>
				x_p(t) = A\cos(\omega t) + B\sin(\omega t)
			</me>
			or equivalently:
			<me>
				x_p(t) = R\cos(\omega t - \phi)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The amplitude of steady-state oscillation is:
			<me>
				R = \frac{F_0/m}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2 - \omega^2)^2 + (2\zeta\omega_0\omega)^2}}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Resonance occurs when <m>\omega \approx \omega_0</m></term>, giving maximum amplitude:
			<me>
				R_{\text{max}} \approx \frac{F_0}{2\zeta m\omega_0^2} = \frac{F_0}{c\omega_0}
			</me>

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			Resonance is one of the most important phenomena in science and engineering. While it can be destructive when unwanted (bridge collapses, machine failures), it's also intentionally exploited in countless applications (radio tuning, MRI imaging, musical instruments, atomic clocks). The method of undetermined coefficients provides the tools to analyze forced systems and predict resonance behavior. Understanding how forcing frequency, natural frequency, and damping interact is essential for designing safe structures and efficient devices. This mathematical framework has saved lives and enabled technologies, demonstrating the real-world impact of differential equations.
