	<p>
		In the previous section, we solved the <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equation</xref> using the characteristic equation. These equations were labeled <em>homogeneous</em> due to the zero on the right-hand side. Next, we consider a class of equations that have a nonzero term on the right. They are called <em>linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficients</em> equations and have the form
		<men xml:id="lncc-equation">
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = {\color{blue} \os{\large \text{nonzero}}{f(x)}}
		</men>. 
		We will also introduce a way to solve such equations using an approach known as <em>undetermined coefficients</em>.
