		We can write this solution as
		<me>
			y = y_h + y_p
		</me>. 
		Substituting this into the equation and separating the <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> parts gives
		<md>
			<mrow> (y_h + y_p)'' + 2(y_h + y_p)' + 3(y_h + y_p) =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> y_h'' + y_p'' - 4y_h' - 4y_p' + 3y_h + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h + y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 
				\us{\Large y_h \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h)}}} 
				+ \
				\us{\Large y_p \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p)}}} 
				=\ &amp; 9x 
			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that each part looks like we separately plugged <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> into the left side of <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>. Now, suppose the <m>y_h</m> part simplified to <m>0</m> and the <m>y_p</m> part gave you <m>9x</m>, then the sum of these parts still equal <m>9x</m>. This  of <m>y_h</m> as the parts of the solution that cancel out with each other and <m>y_p</m> as the parts that simplify to <m>9x</m> (like in the previous section).
	</p>

	<p>
		We can get these two parts by separately solving the equations,
		<me>
			y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad
			y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p = 9x
		</me>,
		for <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. Adding these together gives the general solution, <m>y = y_h + y_p</m>. The next example summarizes this process.
