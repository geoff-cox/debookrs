<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> General Solution Form </title>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned in the last section, the general solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation requires a particular solution to account for non-zero term on the right-hand side. However, there is another <q>hidden</q> part to the general solution that we still need to discuss.
	</p>

	<p>
		To see this, once again consider the equation 
		<men xml:id="lncc-eqn1">
			y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
		</men>
		and assume the general solution can be written as the sum of two parts, 
		<me>
			y = y_h + y_p
		</me>. 
		Substituting this into the equation and separating the <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> parts gives
		<md>
			<mrow> (y_h + y_p)'' + 2(y_h + y_p)' + 3(y_h + y_p) =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> y_h'' + y_p'' - 4y_h' - 4y_p' + 3y_h + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h + y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 
				\us{\Large y_h \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h)}}} 
				+ \
				\us{\Large y_p \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p)}}} 
				=\ &amp; 9x 
			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that each part looks like we separately plugged <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> into the left side of <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>. Now, suppose the <m>y_h</m> part simplified to <m>0</m> and the <m>y_p</m> part gave you <m>9x</m>, then the sum of these parts still equal <m>9x</m>. Think of <m>y_h</m> as the parts of the solution that cancel out with each other and <m>y_p</m> as the parts that simplify to <m>9x</m> (like in the previous section).
	</p>

	<p>
		We can get these two parts by separately solving the equations,
		<me>
			y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad
			y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p = 9x
		</me>,
		for <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. Adding these together gives the general solution, <m>y = y_h + y_p</m>. The next example summarizes this process.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Find the general solution to the differential equation
			</p>
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</me>.
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				To find the general solution, we first solve the homogeneous part
				<me>
					y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h = 0
				</me>.
				We can guess that <m>y_h = e^{3x}</m> is a solution, so we can write
				<me>
					y_h = c_1e^{3x} + c_2e^x
				</me>
				as the general solution to the homogeneous part.
			</p>
		</solution>
