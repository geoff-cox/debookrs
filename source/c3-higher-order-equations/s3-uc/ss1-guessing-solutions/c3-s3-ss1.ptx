	<p>
		In this section we will take a look at the first method that can be used to find a particular solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<me>
			y\left( t \right) = y_c\left( t \right) + Y_P\left( t \right)
		</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		and we already have both the complementary and particular solution from the first example so we don't really need to do any extra work for this problem.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to find the complementary solution and then, because we're probably in the habit of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the complementary solution to find the constants. This however, is incorrect. The complementary solution is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the complementary solution.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation. Taking the complementary solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example we get the following for a general solution and its derivative.
		<me>
			y\left( t \right) = y_c\left( t \right) + Y_P\left( t \right)
		</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		We need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation. Taking the complementary solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example, we get the following for a general solution and its derivative:
		<me>
			y(t) = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 e^{6t}
		</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		At this point, the reason for doing this first will not be apparent; however, we want you in the habit of finding it before we start the work to find a particular solution. Eventually, as we'll see, having the complementary solution in hand will be helpful, so it's best to be in the habit of finding it first prior to doing the work for undetermined coefficients.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now, let's proceed with finding a particular solution. As mentioned prior to the start of this example, we need to make a guess as to the form of a particular solution to this differential equation. Since <math><mi>g</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>t</mi><mo>)</mo></math>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Also, because the point of this example is to illustrate why it is generally a good idea to have the complementary solution in hand first, let's go ahead and recall the complementary solution first. Here it is:
		<me>
			y_c(t) = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 e^{6t}
		</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Upon multiplying this out, none of the terms are in the complementary solution, and so it will be okay.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		As this last set of examples has shown, we really should have the complementary solution in hand before even writing down the first guess for the particular solution. By doing this, we can compare our guess to the complementary solution and if any of the terms from your particular solution show up, we will know that we'll have problems. Once the problem is identified, we can add a <m><mi>t</mi></m> to the problem term(s) and compare our new guess to the complementary solution.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		So, what did we learn from this last example? While technically we don't need the complementary solution to do undetermined coefficients, you can go through a lot of work only to figure out at the end that you needed to add in a <m><mi>t</mi></m> to the guess because it appeared in the complementary solution. This work is avoidable if we first find the complementary solution and compare our guess to the complementary solution and see if any portion of your guess shows up in the complementary solution.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		If a portion of your guess does show up in the complementary solution, then we'll need to modify that portion of the guess by adding in a <m><mi>t</mi></m> to the portion of the guess that is causing the problems.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<me>
		Y_P(t) = -\frac{3}{7} e^{5t}
		</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Before proceeding any further, let's again note that we started off the solution above by finding the complementary solution. This is not technically part of the method of Undetermined Coefficients; however, as we'll eventually see, having this in hand before we make our guess for the particular solution can save us a lot of work and/or headache. Finding the complementary solution first is simply a good habit to have, so we'll try to get you in the habit over the course of the next few examples. At this point, do not worry about why it is a good habit. We'll eventually see why it is a good habit.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now, back to the work at hand. Notice in the last example that we kept saying “a” particular solution, not “the” particular solution. This is because there are other possibilities out there for the particular solution; we've just managed to find one of them. Any of them will work when it comes to writing down the general solution to the differential equation.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		This section is devoted to finding particular solutions and most of the examples will be finding only the particular solution. However, we should do at least one full-blown IVP to make sure that we can say that we've done one.
	</p>
	
	<example><title>Example 2</title>
		<statement>Solve the following IVP</statement>
		<p>
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' - 12y = 3 e^{6t}
			</me>
		</p>
	</example>
