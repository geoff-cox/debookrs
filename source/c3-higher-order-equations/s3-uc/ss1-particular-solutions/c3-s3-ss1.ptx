		A particular solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation is a specific solution that yields the constant (or nonhomogeneous) term on the right side of the equation.
	</p>
    <p>
		To get a better sense of this statement, consider the NHCC differential equation,
		<me>
			y'' + 2y' + 3y = 9x
		</me>.
		Without solving it, observe that no matter what we plug in for <m>y</m>, we need to end up with <m>9x</m> on the right-hand side. In other words, what goes in the blanks
		<me>
			\us{\large 2 \text{ derivatives}}{(<fillin characters="3" />)}'' + 
			2\us{\large 1 \text{ derivative}}{(<fillin characters="3" />)}' + 
			3\us{\large \text{no derivatives}}{(<fillin characters="3" />)} = 9x
		</me>,
		so that we end up with <m>9x</m> on the right?
	</p>

	<p>
		First, lets exclude any terms that don't lead directly to <m>9x</m>. For example, no combination of, say <m>e^{9x}</m> and <m>\sin(3x)</m> (or their derivatives) will ever lead directly to a <m>9x</m> term by itself.
		<fn>
			Note, <m>e^x, \sin x,</m> and <m>\cos x</m> terms are often part of the general solution, but in this context they would have to cancel out on the left-hand side since the right-hand side does not contain any of these terms.
		</fn>
		So what terms of this <em>particular solution</em> are possible?
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Since we need the left side to simplify to <m>9x</m>, it seems reasonable to consider functions that have <m>x</m> terms, such as polynomials. Let's try some <em>particular</em> functions and see if any are solutions.

		Based on the table and questions above, we note the following:
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>
				<p>
					The particular solution for this equation is <m>y = 3x - 2</m> since it was the only function that produced the <m>9x</m> term on the left side to match the right-side.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Derivatives reduce the power of a polynomial, so the highest power term on the left-side comes from plugging <m>y</m> into the <m>3y</m> term. Therefore, the solution, <m>y</m>, must have at most power 1 since the right-side has power 1.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The second and last rows of the table shows that it is not enough to just plug in an <m>x</m> term. The constant term was also needed to balance the left and the right sides of the equation.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		The key take-away of this section is to understand that when solving a differential equation with a non-zero term on the right-side, a specific function is required in the solution to produce this term. We call this function a <em>particular solution</em> and it will always be part of the general solution.
