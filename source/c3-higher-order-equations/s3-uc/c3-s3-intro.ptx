		In the previous section, we solved the LHCC equation
		<fn>linear homogeneous constant coefficient differential equation</fn>,
		<me>
			a_n y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2 y'' + a_1 y' + a_0 y = \!\!\!\! {\color{blue} \os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{0},}}
		</me>
		using the characteristic equation. This equation was tagged <term>homogeneous</term> because of the zero constant term.	We now turn our attention to the more general case where the constant term may be nonzero. These <term>nonhomogeneous</term> equations are defined as follows.

		<statement>
			<p>
				A <term>linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficients</term> (NHCC) equation has the form 
			</p>
			<men xml:id="nhcc-equation">
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x)
			</men>
			<p>
				where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.

		This section develops an approach known as <em>undetermined coefficients</em> to solve these equations. The name comes from part of its strategy where you find the undetermined coefficients of a <q>guessed</q> solution resembling <m>f(x)</m>.
