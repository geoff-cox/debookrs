		Having mastered linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we now turn our attention to the more general case of nonhomogeneous equations. These equations include an additional forcing function, making them slightly more complex but also more applicable to real-world scenarios.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this section, we'll explore the method of undetermined coefficients, which provides an effective way to solve linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient differential equations. By building on our understanding of homogeneous equations and incorporating techniques to find particular solutions, we can tackle these more complex equations with confidence.

	<p>
		<term>Undetermined coefficients</term> is a method used to solve non-homogeneous linear differential equations. It is particularly useful when the non-homogeneous term can be expressed as a linear combination of known functions.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Consider a linear differential equation of the form:
		<me>
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x),
		</me>
		where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_2, a_1, a_0</m> are constants, <m>y</m> is the dependent variable, <m>y', y'', \ldots, y^{(n)}</m> are the derivatives of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, and <m>f(x)</m> is a known function of <m>x</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The general solution to this differential equation can be expressed as the sum of the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation:
		<me>
			y = y_h + y_p,
		</me>
		where <m>y_h</m> is the general solution to the homogeneous equation and <m>y_p</m> is a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		The method of undetermined coefficients involves the following steps:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li> Verify that the method is applicable to the given differential equation.</li>
		<li> Find the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation.</li>
		<li> Guess the form of the particular solution based on the form of the non-homogeneous term.</li>
		<li> Solve for the coefficients of the particular solution.</li>
		<li> Combine the general solution of the homogeneous equation with the particular solution to obtain the complete solution.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		This method is particularly useful when the non-homogeneous term can be expressed as a linear combination of known functions such as polynomials, exponentials, sines, cosines, or their combinations.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this chapter, we will explore the method of undetermined coefficients in detail and apply it to various examples to solve non-homogeneous linear differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		The basic idea behind this method is to assume a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation based on the form of the non-homogeneous term. This particular solution is then substituted back into the original differential equation to determine the coefficients of the assumed functions.
	</p>

	<p>
		By finding the particular solution and combining it with the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation, we can obtain the complete solution to the non-homogeneous linear differential equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		This method is widely used in various fields of science and engineering to solve differential equations that arise in practical applications.
