		As you can imagine, the higher the derivative that appears in a differential equation, the more complex the equation becomes. Fortunately, there is a class of higher-order equations that are relatively easy to solve and make for a great warm-up to the more challenging equations we will encounter later. This class of equations are called linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC).

		In this section, we will learn to identify this new class of equations using the new tags of homogeneity and constant coefficients. We will then explore the technique that finds the solution to these equations by linking them directly to a special equation called the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
