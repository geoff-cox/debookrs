		As you might guess, the higher the derivative in a differential equation, the trickier it gets. But don't worry! There's a class of higher-order equations that are surprisingly manageable and serve as a great introduction to more complex topics. These are called linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC for short.

		In this section, we'll learn to identify these equations using the concepts of homogeneity and constant coefficients. Then, we'll explore a technique that links these equations to something called the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
