        <p>
            Suppose we have a differential equation that we know is linear. From the definition of <xref ref="def-linear" text="custom"> linearity </xref>, our equation could be anything in the form
            <men xml:id="lhcc-l-eqn">
                a_n(x)\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)\ y'' + a_1(x)\ y' + a_0(x)\ y = f(x),
            </men>
            where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the independent and dependent variables, respectively. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The <m>a_n(x),\ \cdots ,\ a_2(x),\ a_1(x),\ a_0(x)</m> terms are called the <term>coefficients</term>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    <m>f(x)</m> is not considered a coefficient of the DE.
                </p>
            </aside>
            of the differential equation and any one of them can be functions of <m>x</m> or constant. When all the coefficients are constant, we say the differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term>.
            
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-linear-constant-coefficient">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A linear differential equation <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> is said to have <term> constant coefficients </term> if each <m>a_{n}(x),\ \cdots , a_2(x),\ a_1(x),\ a_0(x)</m> is constant and <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> becomes
                    <men xml:id="def-lcc-eqn">

                        <p>
                            When a function, <m>a_0(x)</m>, is constant, we usually drop the function notation and just write <m>a_0(x) = a_0</m>.

        <example>

            <p>
                Select the linear differential equations that have constant coefficients.

        <p>
            Now that we have constant coefficients covered, let's move on to homogeneous.

            As a review, suppose we want to find the general solution to the LHCC differential equation
            <men xml:id="full-lhcc-eqn1">
                y'' - 9 y = 0.
            </men>
            According to <xref ref="concept-lhcc-terms"/>, all the parts of the solution should look like <m>e^{rx}</m>. With this in mind, we plugged <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into <xref ref="full-lhcc-eqn1"/>, leading to the characteristic equation
            <me>
                r^2 - 9 = 0,
            </me>
            which has solutions <m>r_1 = 3, r_2 = -3</m>. Therefore, the general solution is a combination of <m>e^{3x}</m> and <m>e^{-3x}</m>, given by
            <men  xml:id="full-lhcc-sol1">
                y(x) = c_1\ e^{3x} + c_2\ e^{-3x}
            </men>
            where <m>c_1, c_2</m> are unknown constants.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            This example shows how the solutions to the characteristic equation lead to the general solution, but not every case works out this nicely. The next few sections, break down differences for each cases that you may encounter.
