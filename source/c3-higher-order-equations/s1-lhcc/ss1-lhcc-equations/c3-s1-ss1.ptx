<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> LHCC Equations </title>
	
	<p>
		As mentioned in the introduction, the new class of equations are linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. For brevity, we will refer to this type of equation an LHCC equation. Before we can begin solving these equations, we need to be able to recognize them when we see them. Formally, the three tags that define an LHCC equation are
		<em> linear </em>, <em> homogeneous </em>, and <em> constant coefficients </em>.
	</p>

	<p> 
		A linear differential equation has the form
		<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
			\us{\text{constant term}}{\us{\uparrow}{{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x)}}}.}}
		</men>
		If the constant term is zero, then this equation is <term>homogeneous</term>. Additionally, if all the coefficients are numbers, then the equation has <term>constant coefficients</term>. The combination of all of these is summarized in the next definition.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
		<statement>
			<p>
				A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) has the form 
			</p>
			<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
			</men>
			<p>
				where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Let's practice identiying some differential equations with these new tags.
	</p>

	<example>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Which of the linear differential equations below are homogeneous?
			</p>
			<me> 
				3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, 		\quad 
				\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, 	\quad 
				\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s 
			</me>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The trick is to see if the constant term is zero. Recall, the constant term should not contain the dependent variable or its derivatives. Rewriting each equation with the constant term on the right makes it more clear. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				<me> 
					3y'' - 2ty' + y	= \color{blue}{0}, 		\quad 
					\frac{dg}{dx}	= \color{blue}{-3x^2}, 	\quad 
					\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = \color{blue}{0} 
				</me>.
				As you can see the first and last equations are homogeneous.
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<example>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Which of the linear differential equations have constant coefficients?
			</p>
			<me> 
				3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, 		\quad 
				\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, 	\quad 
				\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s 
			</me>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				For this question, we need to make sure <em>all</em> the coefficients are constants.
			</p>
			<p>
				<me> 
					\os{\checkmark}{\fbox{3}}\ y'' - \os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{2t}}y' + y	= 0, 		\quad 
					\frac{dg}{dx}	= -3x^2, 	\quad 
					\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = 0 
				</me>.
				Only the first equation has constant coefficients.
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		If we also say that the linear homogeneous differential equation in <xref ref="def-lhcc"/> has <xref ref="def-linear-constant-coefficient" text="custom">constant coefficients</xref>, then <xref ref="def-lhcc"/> becomes
		<me>
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0,
		</me>
		which is equation ? in the ?.
	</p>

	<example>

			Select the linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients.

	<p>
		At this point, you should be able to identify when a differential equation is linear, homogeneous, and has constant coefficients, which is the ? first step ? in applying the ?.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since the ? only solves linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients, we need to familiarize ourselves with these new terms. In this section, we will introduce these concepts and practice identifying which differential equations can be solved with the LHCC method.
	</p>

	<p>
		This chapter is all about linear differential equations with constant coefficients. To get started, let's review what it means to be a coefficient in a differential equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Back in the first chapter, we considered the 5-term equation
		<me>
			\us{y^{(6)}	\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ \frac{3}{x}	{\color{blue}\ y^{(6)}	}	}	} +
			\us{y''		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		5.3	{\color{blue}\ y''		} 	}	} +
			\us{y' 		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		x^2	{\color{blue}\ y'		} 	}	} -
			\us{y 		\text{ term}	}{\us{\uparrow}{	{\color{blue}\ y		} 	}	} =
			\us{\text{constant term}	}{\ub{\ \frac12\ln(x)\ 							}	}
		</me>,
		with the coefficients <m>\frac{3}{x},\ 5.3,\ x^2,\ 1</m> and <m>\frac12\ln(x)</m>. We observed that some of the coefficients were <em>functions</em> <m>\big(\frac{3}{x}</m> &amp; <m>x^2\big)</m> and some were <em>constants</em> (<m>5.3</m> &amp; <m>1</m>). Naturally, a differential equation that is said to have <em>constant coefficients</em> should only have coefficients that are constant, as the next definition states.	
	</p>

	<definition><title> Constant Coefficients </title>
	
		<statement>
			<p>
				A differential equation is said to have <term> constant coefficients </term> if every coefficient in the equation is constant.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<example>

		<p>
			All of the differential equations, below, have constant coefficients.
		</p>
		<me>
			\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}y' = y, \quad s'''+\pi s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>

		<p>
			Whereas, the following differential equations do not:
		</p>
		<me>
			t\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}x y' = y, \quad s'''+ \cos(\pi w) s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>
