	<p>
		Our goal is to eventually be able to solve the new class of <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>. However, we need to to develop some inituition as to what kind of solutions to expect, which we will cover here.
	</p>

	<p>
		To begin, think back to your calculus class and try to think of a function whose derivative is itself? If you remembered <m>e^x</m>, you are correct and if you think about it, this question can also be rephrased as a differential equation. Specifically, find the function <m>y</m> such that the derivative of <m>y</m> is <m>y</m>, or
		<me>
			y' = y.
		</me>
		As mentioned already, <m>y=e^x</m> is the answer, but it is not hard to verify that <m>y = c e^x</m> is too. Let's go a bit further and try to think of a function whose derivative is a multiple of itself, say <m>3y</m>. A little thought may lead you to <m>y = e^{3x}</m> because of the chain rule, but if it didn't, you could solve the equation
		<me>
			y' = 3y
		</me>
		using separation of variables to get the general solutoin, <m>y = c e^{3x}</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The point of this discussion is to lead you to the following important concept: 
		<assemblage><title> Property of the Exponential Function </title>
			<p>
				<ul marker="square">
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>e^{rx}</m> is the only function whose derivative is a multiple of itself.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<m>e^{rx}</m> and its derivatives are <q>like terms</q> that can be <em>combined/simplified.</em>
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</assemblage>
		Consequently, all other functions are fundamentally changed by differentiation and do not result in <q>like terms</q> that can be combined or simplified in the same way. For example, the derivative of <m>x^8</m> is <m>8x^7</m>, which cannot be combined or simplified. However, <m>e^{3x}</m> and its derivative <m>3e^{3x}</m>, can be added together to give <m>e^{3x} + 3e^{3x} = 4e^{3x}</m>.
	</p>

	<p> 
		This brings us back to the LHCC equation, which has the form
		<men xml:id="lhcc-equation-like-terms">
			\us{\text{must sum to } 0 \text{ after plugging in } y}{\ub{
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y
			}}	= 0
		</men>.
		The right side of the equation is zero, which means the left side must sum to zero after plugging in <m>y</m>. This can only happen if the solution, <m>y</m>, and its derivatives combine to cancel each other out. As discussed, the only functions that can be combined like this are <m>e^{rx}</m> and its derivatives.
