            Suppose we have a differential equation that we know is linear. From the definition of <xref ref="def-linear" text="custom"> linearity </xref>, our equation could be anything in the form
            <men xml:id="lhcc-l-eqn">
                a_n(x)\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)\ y'' + a_1(x)\ y' + a_0(x)\ y = f(x),
            </men>
            where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are the independent and dependent variables, respectively. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The <m>a_n(x),\ \cdots ,\ a_2(x),\ a_1(x),\ a_0(x)</m> terms are called the <term>coefficients</term>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    <m>f(x)</m> is not considered a coefficient of the DE.
                </p>
            </aside>
            of the differential equation and any one of them can be functions of <m>x</m> or constant. When all the coefficients are constant, we say the differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term>.
            
        </p>

        <definition xml:id="def-linear-constant-coefficient">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    A linear differential equation <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> is said to have <term> constant coefficients </term> if each <m>a_{n}(x),\ \cdots , a_2(x),\ a_1(x),\ a_0(x)</m> is constant and <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> becomes
                    <men xml:id="def-lcc-eqn">
                        a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x),
                    </men>
                    <aside>
                        <p>
                            When a function, <m>a_0(x)</m>, is constant, we usually drop the function notation and just write <m>a_0(x) = a_0</m>.
                        </p>
                    </aside>
                </p>

        </definition>

        <example>

            <p>
                Select the linear differential equations that have constant coefficients.
            </p>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Solution
                </p>
            </solution>

        </example>

        <p>
            Now that we have constant coefficients covered, let's move on to homogeneous.
