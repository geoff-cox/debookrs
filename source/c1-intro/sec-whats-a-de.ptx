			In this section, we'll explore what a differential equation is, starting with an analogy, and then moving to a formal definition.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection label="connection-to-algebra">
		<title>Connection to Algebra &amp; Calculus</title>

		<p>
			To learn something new, it helps to connect it to something you already know. So let's begin by linking differential equations to algebra.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suppose you're asked to solve each of the following equations for <m>y</m>:
			<me>
				y + 2 = 11, \qquad y + 2t = 11, \qquad y^3 + 2t = 11.
			</me>
			The goal of algebra is to figure out what number or function goes in place of <m>y</m> to make both sides equal. Instead of guessing, you learned rules for isolating <m>y</m>. If we apply those rules, we get:
			<md>
				<mrow> y = 9, \qquad y = 11 - 2t, \qquad y^3 \amp = 11 - 2t </mrow>
				<mrow> y \amp = \left(11 - 2t\right)^{1/3} </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Now suppose you're asked to solve a new equation:
			<me>
				y' + 2t = 11.
			</me>
			As before, we isolate <m>y'</m>, giving:
			<me>
				y' = 11 - 2t.
			</me>
			So what function has a derivative of <m>11 - 2t</m>? In other words, what goes in place of <m>y</m> to make this equation true?
		</p>

		<p>
			From calculus, you might recognize this as an anti-derivative problem. So the solution is:
			<me>
			y = \int (11 - 2t)\, dt = 11t - t^2 + C.
			</me>
			Believe it or not, you just solved a differential equation using algebra and calculus! Most problems won't be quite that straightforward, but the goal is the same: find a function that fits in place of <m>y</m> and makes the equation true.

		<title>Definition of a Differential Equation</title>

		<p>
			Essentially, a differential equation is any equation where the unknown has a derivative applied to it. Here's the formal definition.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-diff-eq">
			<title>Differential Equation</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
					If the function depends on a single variable, it's called an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>.
					If the function depends on more than one variable, it's called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<aside component="web"><title>DE <m>\Rightarrow</m> ODE</title>
			<p>
				📌 Since this course only covers <em>ordinary differential equations</em>,	any time we say <em>differential equation</em> or <em>DE</em>, we mean <em>ODE</em>.
			</p>
		</aside>
	
		<p>
			So, for an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include two things:
			First, it needs a derivative—something like <m>f'</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
			Second, it must have an equals sign.
		</p>

		<p>
			That means all of the following are differential equations:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime).
			</me>
			On the other hand, these are not differential equations—either because they don't contain a derivative, or because they don't include an equals sign:

			<me>
				\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0
			</me>
		</p>
