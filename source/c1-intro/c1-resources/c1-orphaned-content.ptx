			<p>
				In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = <m>I</m>, and time = <m>t</m>.  For this discussion, let's assume time is in days.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<em>What are the dependent and independent variable in this case?</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Since the number of infected, <m>I</m>, changes according to how much time, <m>t</m>, has	passed, then <m>I</m> depends on <m>t</m>. Therefore, <m>I</m> would the dependent variable and <m>t</m> would be the independent variable.
			</p>

			<p>
				Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be
				<me>I(t) = \text{some function of } t</me>.
				Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time.  Now, let's say we have the solution, <m>I</m>, plug <m>t=10</m>	into it, and see the following:
				<me> I(10) = 30. </me>
				This result would be interpreted as "after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected".
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>What is one value for the number of infected we should know?</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we	know
				<me>I(0) = 12</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Any information about the initial value of a dependent variable is referred to as an <term> initial condition. </term>
			</p>

			<p>
				To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points of the previous section that will be useful in this section.
				<ul>
				<li>
					The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.
				</li>
				<li>
					All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of possible solutions we called a family of solutions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.
				</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<remark xml:id="sect-01-04-01-remark-01">
				<p>
				Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is equal to the order of the differential equation<m>^{1}</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
				This is illustrated in ? since <m>y'' - y' - 12y = 0</m> is of 2nd order and the general solution, <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m>, has 2 constants, <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
				</p>
			</remark>
			
			<aside>
				<p>
				<m>^{1}</m> There are some exceptions when working with nonlinear DEs.
				</p>
			</aside>
			
			<p>
				Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). [?] shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the <m>t, y</m>-plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.
			</p>

			<note><title> <em>Don't assume a function that satisfies a DE is a general solution!</em> </title>
				<p>
					A function that contains constants and satisfies a differential equation <em>does not mean it is the general solution</em> since it could be missing a term. For example, both of the functions, below, are solutions to <m>y'' = 1</m>,
					<me>
						y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2
					</me>.
					However, only <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2</m> is the general solution. In fact, you can get the first function by setting <m>c_2 = 0</m> in the second function, showing that the second function is more general than the first.

					A term is nonlinear if it contains a dependent variable, <m>y</m> or <m>y^{(n)}</m>, that is
