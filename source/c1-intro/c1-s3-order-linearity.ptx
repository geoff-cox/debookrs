			Separating differential equations into different categories is known as classification and is essential in determining which method can be used to find its solution. The categories are based on some property that all equations have in common. In this section, we will look at the two of the most common ways to separate differential equationsâ€”order and linearity.
		</p>

	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> Order </title>
		
		<p>
			As long as an equation contains at least one derivative, then it is a differential equation. However, this also means that there is no restriction on the number of derivatives that can appear in an equation. In general, the more derivatives present, the more complex the equation. To represent this complexity, differential equations are classified by an <term>order</term>, which refers to the highest derivative present in the equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the differential equation
			<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</me>
			is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. In contrast, the equation
			<me>x^2y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8</me>
			is a <em>third-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>y'''</m>.
		</p>
		
		<example><title> Identify the Order </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						For each of the following differential equations, identify the order.
						<me>
							\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17, \qquad w^6 + \sin\big(w^{(5)}\big) = 0
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The first equation has <em>second-order</em> since the highest derivative of <m>A</m> is <m>2</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second equation has <em>fifth-order</em> because the highest derivative is <m>\ds w^{(5)}</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<note><title>A Common Pitfall: Derivatives vs. Exponents</title>
			<p>
				This example highlights that you should be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. Since <m>w^6</m> is <m>w</m> to the 6th power, it does not contribute to the order of the equation. Only derivatives affect the order.
			</p>

	<subsection><title> Linear Terms </title>

		<p>
			The task of identifying the linearity of a differential equation boils down to determining if all of its terms are linear. Therefore, we will start by discussing what it means for a term to be linear and then extend this concept to the entire differential equation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All linear terms in a differential equation adhere to the following rule:
		</p>

		<p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					A <xref ref="summary-terms" text="custom">term</xref> of a differential equation is linear if it contains a single <xref ref="summary-dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent variable</xref> or a derivative of this variable to the power of <m>1</m> and not inside another non-linear function.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is important to note that the <xref ref="summary-coefficients" text="custom">coefficient</xref> of a term does not affect its linearity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the differential equation:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5} + 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right) + y^2 = t^3.
			</me>
			The equation includes the following terms:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}, \quad 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right), \quad y^2, \quad t^3.
			</me>
			Let's examine the linearity of each term:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves the product of <m>y</m> and <m>\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m>, violating the single-variable in a term condition.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds 2t^3\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m></title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it involves a single derivative of <m>y</m> to the power of 1. Coefficients like <m>2t^3</m> do not impact linearity.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as the dependent variable is inside the logarithm function.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds y^2</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves <m>y</m> raised to the power of 2.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds t^3</m></title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it does not involve the dependent variable or its derivatives.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>

		<p>
			Now, let's apply this understanding to a practical example.
		</p>

		<example><title> Identify the Linearity of the Terms </title>

	<subsection><title> Linearity </title>

		<p>
			Extending the concept of linear terms, we say <q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q> This idea leads us to the following definition of a linear differential equation (of any order).
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-linear">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it can be written as the sum of linear terms, like so
					<fn>
						<p>
							This is commonly referred to a <term> linear combination </term> of the dependent variable and its derivatives.
						</p>
					</fn>
					<men xml:id="linear-equation">
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)\ y^{(n)}}} + \cdots +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)\ y''}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)\ y'}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)\ y}} = f(t)
					</men>
					If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			We are now equipped to determine the linearity of a differential equation by examining the linearity of each term, as demonstrated in the next example.
		</p>

		<example><title> Identify the Linearity of the Equation </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Determine the linearity of each differential equation.
						<me>
							y^{(5)} + \frac{y'}{x^2} + 5y = \ln x, \qquad P^{(6)} + \frac{m P'}{P} = (m - 1)^2
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					To determine the linearity, we need to examine the linearity of each term, remembering to focus only on the dependent variable and its derivatives.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the first equation, the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and we can label the linearity of each terms as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}{\color{BurntOrange} y^{(5)} }} +
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\frac{1}{x^2}{\color{BurntOrange} y'}} +
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}5{\color{BurntOrange} y}} =\ \amp
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln x}.
						</mrow>
					</md>
					Since every term is linear, the differential equation is linear.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the second equation, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the terms are labeled as
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}\color{BurntOrange} P^{(6)}}} +
							\underset{\overline{\text{nonlinear}}}{m\frac{{\color{BurntOrange} P'}}{{\color{BurntOrange} P}}} =\ \amp
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}(m - 1)^2}}
						</mrow>,
					</md>
					showing the differential equation is nonlinear since there is at least one nonlinear term.
				</p>
			</solution>
