			Now that you know how to identify a differential equation, the next step is to familiarize yourself with its various components, such as variables, terms, and coefficients. This section will introduce you to these elements and define them within the context of differential equations. 
		</p>
		
	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> Variables </title>

		<p>
			At the heart of solving a differential equation is identifying its variables. In every differential equation, we deal with two types of variables:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li>
				<title>Dependent Variable:</title>
				<p>
					The unknown function we aim to solve for. It depends on the other variable(s) in the equation.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title>Independent Variable:</title>
				<p>
					The variable that the dependent variable changes with respect to.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>

		<p>
			Let's make this concrete with a simple example. Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
			</men>
			Here, <m>y</m> is the dependent variableâ€”it is the unknown function we are solving for. We know <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m> because of the presence of <m>dy/dx</m> (i.e. the rate of change of <m>y</m> as <m>x</m> changes). Therefore, <m>x</m> is the independent variable because <m>y</m> changes as <m>x</m> changes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Identifying these roles is essential because it tells us what we are solving for and influences tools we can use to solve the equation.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="c1-s2-1-ex1"><title> Identify the Variables </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Let's practice identifying variables in the following differential equations:
						<me>
							\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\quad 
							u'' + t^2 u = 0,\quad 
							Q'' = 11Q
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The first equation contains <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies <m>P</m> changes as <m>s</m> changes. So,
					<ul>
						<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
						<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow P</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow s</m> .</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> is the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So, <m>u</m> must change as <m>t</m> changes and
					<ul>
						<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>t</m>.</li>
						<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow u</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow t</m> .</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> indicates that <m>Q</m> is changing and so it must be the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, if no independent variable is shown and the context of the problem doesn't provide it, then you are free to choose it yourself.

	<subsection><title> Terms and Coefficients </title>

		<aside><title> ðŸ“Œ Note: Defining Terms </title>
			<p>
				Although, a <q>term</q> is generic way to describe a mathematical object. To avoid confusion, we will only use it as defined here.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			A differential equation is constructed from <em>terms</em>, each separated by a plus (<m>+</m>), minus (<m>-</m>), or equal (<m>=</m>) sign and is associated with the dependent variable or its derivatives. If a term does not contain a dependent variable, it is called a <term>constant term</term>. For example, the differential equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="terms-coefficients-example">
			\frac{3}{x} y^{(6)} + 5.3 y'' + x^2 (y'-4)^3 - y = \frac12\ln(x)
		</men>
		
		<p>
			contains the following terms:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ul{y^{(6)}\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{(y'-4)^3\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{\text{constant term}}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds \frac{3}{x} y^{(6)}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds 5.3 y''</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds x^2 (y'-4)^3</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds -y</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds \frac12\ln(x)</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Every differential equation has at least a zero constant term. For example, the equation <m>y' = -3y</m> can be rewritten as <m>y' + 3y = 0</m>, showing an implicit <m>0</m> constant term.
		</p>

		<p>
			The coefficients in a differential equation are constants or functions that multiply the dependent variable or its derivatives. These coefficients critically influence the behavior of the equation and the solution methods applicable. In the equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="coefficients-example">
			y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0,
		</men>
		
		<p>
			the coefficients are:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y' \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y  \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>1</m></cell>
					<cell><m>-3</m></cell>
					<cell><m>2</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>

		<p>
			Coefficients may also be functions of the independent variable, as seen in the equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="variable-coefficients-example">
			t^2 y'' + 5t y' + 6y = \sin(t).
		</men>
		
		<p>
			Here, the coefficients are:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y' \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y  \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>t^2</m></cell>
					<cell><m>5t</m></cell>
					<cell><m>6</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>

		<example xml:id="terms-and-coefficients-example"><title> Identify the Terms &amp; Coefficients </title>
		
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify the terms and coefficients in the equation:
						<me>
							3t^2 z' - 4\cos t + \frac{z'z}{t} - 515 \sqrt{1+z^2} = -7.
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The dependent variable in this equation is <m>z</m>. The <m>-4\cos t</m> and <m>-7</m> do not contain <m>z</m>, so they combine as a single constant term on the right-hand side:
					<me>
						3t^2 z' + \frac{1}{t} z'z - 515 \sqrt{1+z^2} = 4\cos t - 7.
					</me>
					The terms and coefficients are:
					<tabular halign="center">
						<row>
							<cell><m>\ul{z'\ \text{ term}}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\ul{z'z\ \text{ term}}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\ul{\sqrt{1+z^2}\ \text{ term}}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\ul{\text{constant term}}</m></cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell><m>3t^2 z'</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\frac{1}{t} z'z</m></cell>
							<cell><m>-515 \sqrt{1+z^2}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>4\cos t - 7</m></cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
					<tabular halign="center">
						<row>
							<cell><m>\ul{z'\ \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\ul{z'z\ \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\ul{\sqrt{1+z^2}\ \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
						</row>
						<row>
							<cell><m>3t^2</m></cell>
							<cell><m>\frac{1}{t}</m></cell>
							<cell><m>-515</m></cell>
						</row>
					</tabular>
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

			Understanding the roles of terms and coefficients will guide us in classifying and solving differential equations effectively.
