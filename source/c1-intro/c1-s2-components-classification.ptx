			Now that you understand how to identify a differential equation, the next step is to become familiar with its various components and how they collectively describe the equation. In this section, we will introduce you to these basic elements and explore how they can be used to categorize differential equations into the most common groups. Classifying differential equations based on shared properties is crucial for determining the appropriate method to find a solution.

	<subsection><title> Variables </title>

		<p>
			At the heart of solving a differential equation is identifying its variables. In every differential equation, we deal with two types of variables:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li>
				<title> Dependent Variable: </title>
				<p>
					The unknown function we aim to solve for. It depends on the other variable(s) in the equation.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title> Independent Variable: </title>
				<p>
					The variable that the dependent variable changes with respect to.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>

		<p>
			Let's make this concrete with a simple example. Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
			</men>
			Here, <m>y</m> is the dependent variableâ€”it is the unknown function we are solving for. We know <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m> because of the presence of <m>dy/dx</m> (i.e. the rate of change of <m>y</m> as <m>x</m> changes). Therefore, <m>x</m> is the independent variable because <m>y</m> changes as <m>x</m> changes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Identifying these roles is essential because it tells us what we are solving for and influences tools we can use to solve the equation.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="c1-s2-1-ex1"><title> Identify the Variables </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Let's practice identifying variables in the following differential equations:
						<me>
							\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\quad
							u'' + t^2 u = 0,\quad
							Q'' = 11Q
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The first equation contains <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies <m>P</m> changes as <m>s</m> changes. So,
					<ul>
						<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
						<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow P</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow s</m> .</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>
					The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> is the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So, <m>u</m> must change as <m>t</m> changes and
					<ul>
						<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>t</m>.</li>
						<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow u</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow t</m> .</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> indicates that <m>Q</m> is changing and so it must be the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, if no independent variable is shown and the context of the problem doesn't provide it, then you are free to choose it yourself.

	<subsection><title> Terms &amp; Coefficients </title>

		<aside><title> ðŸ“Œ Note: Defining Terms </title>
			<p>
				Although, a <q>term</q> is generic way to describe a mathematical object. To avoid confusion, we will only use it as defined here.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			A differential equation is constructed from <term>terms</term>, each separated by a plus (<m>+</m>), minus (<m>-</m>), or equal (<m>=</m>) sign and is associated with the dependent variable or its derivatives. If a term does not contain a dependent variable, it is called a <term>constant term</term>. For example, the differential equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="terms-coefficients-example">
			\frac{3}{x} y^{(6)} + 5.3 y'' + x^2 (y'-4)^3 - y = \frac12\ln(x)
		</men>
		
		<p>
			contains the following terms:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ul{y^{(6)}\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{(y'-4)^3\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y\text{ term}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{\text{constant term}}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds \frac{3}{x} y^{(6)}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds 5.3 y''</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds x^2 (y'-4)^3</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds -y</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds \frac12\ln(x)</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Every differential equation has a constant term, even if one is not explicitly shown in the equation. For example, the equation <m>y' = -3y</m> can be rewritten as <m>y' + 3y = 0</m>, revealing a <m>0</m> constant term.
		</p>

		<p>
			The coefficients in a differential equation are constants or functions that multiply the dependent variable or its derivatives. These coefficients critically influence the behavior of the equation and the solution methods applicable. In the equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="coefficients-example">
			y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0,
		</men>
		
		<p>
			the coefficients are:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<tabular halign="center">
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ul{y' \text{ coefficient}}</m></cell>

					<cell><m>1</m></cell>
					<cell><m>-3</m></cell>
					<cell><m>2</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>

		<p>
			Coefficients may also be functions of the independent variable, as seen in the equation:
		</p>
		
		<men xml:id="variable-coefficients-example">
			t^2 y'' + 5t y' + 6y = \sin(t).
		</men>
		
		<p>

			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The dependent variable in this equation is <m>z</m>. The <m>-4\cos t</m> and <m>-7</m> do not contain <m>z</m>, so they combine as a single constant term on the right-hand side:

	<subsection><title> Order </title>
		
		<p>
			As long as an equation contains at least one derivative, then it is a differential equation. However, this also means that there is no restriction on the number of derivatives that can appear in an equation. In general, the more derivatives present, the more complex the equation. To represent this complexity, differential equations are classified by an <term>order</term>, which refers to the highest derivative present in the equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the differential equation
			<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</me>
			is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. In contrast, the equation
			<me>x^2y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8</me>
			is a <em>third-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>y'''</m>.
		</p>
		
		<example><title> Identify the Order </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						For each of the following differential equations, identify the order.
						<me>
							\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17, \qquad w^6 + \sin\big(w^{(5)}\big) = 0
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The first equation has <em>second-order</em> since the highest derivative of <m>A</m> is <m>2</m>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second equation has <em>fifth-order</em> because the highest derivative is <m>\ds w^{(5)}</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<note><title> A Common Pitfall: Derivatives vs. Exponents </title>
			<p>
				This example highlights that you should be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. Since <m>w^6</m> is <m>w</m> to the 6th power, it does not contribute to the order of the equation. Only derivatives affect the order.
			</p>

	<subsection><title> Linear Terms </title>

		<p>
			The task of identifying the linearity of a differential equation boils down to determining if all of its terms are linear. Therefore, we will start by discussing what it means for a term to be linear and then extend this concept to the entire differential equation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			All linear terms in a differential equation adhere to the following rule:
		</p>

		<p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					A <xref ref="summary-terms" text="custom">term</xref> of a differential equation is linear if it contains a single <xref ref="summary-dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent variable</xref> or a derivative of this variable to the power of <m>1</m> and not inside another non-linear function.
				</p>
			</blockquote>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is important to note that the <xref ref="summary-coefficients" text="custom">coefficient</xref> of a term does not affect its linearity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the differential equation:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5} + 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right) + y^2 = t^3.
			</me>
			The equation includes the following terms:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}, \quad 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right), \quad y^2, \quad t^3.
			</me>
			Let's examine the linearity of each term:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li>
				<title> <m>\ds y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m> </title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves the product of <m>y</m> and <m>\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m>, violating the single-variable in a term condition.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title> <m>\ds 2t^3\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m> </title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it involves a single derivative of <m>y</m> to the power of 1. Coefficients like <m>2t^3</m> do not impact linearity.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title> <m>\ds \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)</m> </title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as the dependent variable is inside the logarithm function.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title> <m>\ds y^2</m> </title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves <m>y</m> raised to the power of 2.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title> <m>\ds t^3</m> </title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it does not involve the dependent variable or its derivatives.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>

		<p>
			Now, let's apply this understanding to a practical example.
		</p>

		<example><title> Identify the Linearity of the Terms </title>

	<subsection><title> Linearity </title>

		<p>
			Extending the concept of linear terms, we say <q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q> This idea leads us to the following definition of a linear differential equation (of any order).
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-linear">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it can be written as the sum of linear terms, like so
					<fn>
						<p>
							This is commonly referred to a <term> linear combination </term> of the dependent variable and its derivatives.
						</p>
					</fn>
					<men xml:id="linear-equation">
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)\ y^{(n)}}} + \cdots +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)\ y''}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)\ y'}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)\ y}} = f(t)
					</men>
					If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			For example, the following differential equations are linear:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="linear-equation-examples">
			3\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 0, \qquad y''' - 2y' - \frac{7}{x}y = e^x, \qquad w'' - \tan(t) = 3t
		</men>.

		<p>
			In contrast, these are nonlinear since they contain a nonlinear term (boxed):
		</p>

		<aside>
			<p>
				ðŸ˜• = nonlinear term
			</p>
		</aside>

		<men xml:id="nonlinear-equation-examples">

			\us{\largeðŸ˜•}{\ul{\omega\omega^{(5)}}} + s = \us{\largeðŸ˜•}{\ul{ e^\omega }}
		</men>.
		
		<p>
			We are now equipped to determine the linearity of a differential equation by examining the linearity of each term, as demonstrated in the next example.
		</p>

		<example><title> Identify the Linearity of the Equation </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Determine the linearity of each differential equation.
						<me>
							y^{(5)} + \frac{y'}{x^2} + 5y = \ln x, \qquad P^{(6)} + \frac{m P'}{P} = (m - 1)^2
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					To determine the linearity, we need to examine the linearity of each term, remembering to focus only on the dependent variable and its derivatives.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the first equation, the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and we can label the linearity of each terms as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}{\color{BurntOrange} y^{(5)} }} +
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\frac{1}{x^2}{\color{BurntOrange} y'}} +
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}5{\color{BurntOrange} y}} =\ \amp
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln x}
						</mrow>.
					</md>
					Since every term is linear, the differential equation is linear.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the second equation, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the terms are labeled as
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}\color{BurntOrange} P^{(6)}}} +

							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}(m - 1)^2}}
						</mrow>,
					</md>
					showing the differential equation is nonlinear since there is at least one nonlinear term.
