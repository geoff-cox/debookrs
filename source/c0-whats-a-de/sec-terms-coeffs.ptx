			Before we begin solving differential equations, we need a shared vocabulary for discussing their structure. In this section, we introduce the concepts of <q>terms</q> and <q>coefficients</q>, which help us describe what an equation is composed of and prepare us to classify and solve different types of equations.
		</p>

		<title>Terms</title>

		<p>
			In mathematics, the word <q>term</q> usually refers to a part of an expression separated by plus or minus signs. The same idea applies to differential equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, a term in a differential equation is any piece of the equation separated by addition or subtraction. For example, we might have something like:
			<me>
				\text{term}\ 1 + \text{term}\ 2 - \text{term}\ 3 = \text{term}\ 4 - \text{term}\ 5.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This example has three terms on the left-hand side and two on the right.
		</p>

		<p>
			Terms in a differential equation can include the dependent variable, its derivatives, constants, or other functions of the independent variable. If a term does not involve the dependent variable or its derivatives, we call it a <term>free term</term>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, consider the five-term differential equation with dependent variable <m>y</m>:
			<me>
				\frac{3}{x} y^{(6)} + 5.3 y'' + x^2 y' + y = \frac12\ln(x)
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is common to group terms by the different forms of the dependent variable:
		</p>
		
		<tabular halign="center">
			<row>
				<cell bottom="minor"><me>y^{(6)}\ \text{term}</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell bottom="minor"><me>y''\ \text{term}</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell bottom="minor"><me>y'\ \text{term}</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell bottom="minor"><me>y\ \text{term}</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell bottom="minor"><me>\text{free term}</me></cell>
			</row>
			<row><cell/></row>
			<row>
				<cell><me>\frac{3}{x} y^{(6)}</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell><me>5.3 y''</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell><me>x^2 y'</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell><me>y</me></cell>
				<cell/>
				<cell><me>\frac12\ln(x)</me></cell>
			</row>
		</tabular>

			<p>
				<e component="emoji">📌</e> Think of a <term>free term</term> as being <q>free</q> of the dependent variable.
			</p>

			<p>
				<e component="emoji">📌</e> These are often called <em>constant terms</em>, but this can be misleading, as they may contain independent variables.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			Every differential equation has a free term, even if it is not written explicitly. For example, <m>y' = -3y</m> can be rewritten as <m>y' + 3y = 0</m>, with <m>0</m> as the free term.
		</p>

		<exercise label="components-cyu-2">

			<statement>

					Identify the free term in the differential equation
					<me>3t^2 y' - 4t^2 = \frac{1}{t} y</me>.

			<choices randomize="yes">

		<p>
			In a differential equation, a <term>coefficient</term> is a constant or a function of the independent variable that multiplies the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. Coefficients determine the equation's structure and influence which solution methods are applicable.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, in the equation
			<men xml:id="example-coefficients-of-a-de-1">
				y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0,
			</men>
			the coefficients of <m>y''</m>, <m>y'</m>, and <m>y</m> are the constants <m>1</m>, <m>-3</m>, and <m>2</m>, respectively.
		</p>

		<p>
			Coefficients need not be constants. They can also be functions of the independent variable. For instance, in the equation
			<me>
				t^2 y'' + 5t y' + 6y = \sin(t),
			</me>
			the coefficient of <m>y''</m> is <m>t^2</m>, the coefficient of <m>y'</m> is <m>5t</m>, and the coefficient of <m>y</m> is <m>6</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In general, for something to be considered a coefficient, it must not involve the dependent variable.
		</p>
