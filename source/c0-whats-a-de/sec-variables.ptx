	<title>Dependent &amp; Independent Variables</title>

	<p>
		Every differential equation involves two kinds of variables: a <term>dependent variable</term> and an <term>independent variable</term>. The dependent variable is the unknown function we're solving for. It depends on the independent variable and is always differentiated with respect to it.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, consider the equation:
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2
		</men>
		Here, we solve for <m>y</m>, which is the dependent variable. Since we're taking the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>x</m> is the independent variable.
	</p>

	<p>
		Identifying the dependent variable not only tells us what we're solving for, but also helps determine which methods we can use to solve the equation.
	</p>

	<example>
		<title>Identify the Variables</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Identify the dependent and independent variables in each equation:
				<me>
					\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\qquad
					u'' + t^2 u = 0,\qquad
					Q'' = 11Q
				</me>
				
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation contains <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies <m>P</m> changes as <m>s</m> changes. So,
				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
					<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow P</m>, <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow s</m>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> is the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So, <m>u</m> must change as <m>t</m> changes and
				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>t</m>.</li>
					<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow u</m>, <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow t</m>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> indicates that <m>Q</m> is changing, and so it must be the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, the independent variable will be clear from the context of the problem, but in this case, just assume whatever variable you like.
