		Essentially, a differential equation is any equation where the unknown has a derivative applied to it. Here's the formal definition.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-diff-eq">
		<title>Differential Equation</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
				If the function depends on a single variable, it's called an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>.
				If the function depends on more than one variable, it's called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<aside component="web">
		<title>DE <m>\Rightarrow</m> ODE</title>
		<p>
			📌 Since this course only covers <em>ordinary differential equations</em>,	any time we say <em>differential equation</em> or <em>DE</em>, we mean <em>ODE</em>.
		</p>
	</aside>

	<p>
		So, for an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include two things:
		First, it needs a derivative—something like <m>f'</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
		Second, it must have an equals sign.
	</p>

	<p>
		This means all of the following are differential equations:
		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime).
		</me>
		On the other hand, the following equations
		<me>
			\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0
		</me>
		are not differential equations because they don't contain a derivative, or because they don't include an equals sign.

			In this text, we'll use several common notations for derivatives. These include prime notation, like <m>y'</m> or <m>y''</m>; Leibniz notation, using <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>; and dot notation, which is typically reserved for derivatives with respect to time.
