			This textbook introduces a new type of equation that incorporates not only an unknown function but also how that function changes over time. These equations are called <em>differential equations</em>. In this section, we will provide a clear definition and review the various ways of representing derivatives.

		<title>Definition</title>

			<statement>
				<p>
					A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
					If the function depends on a single variable, it's called an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>.
					If the function depends on more than one variable, it's called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<title>DE <m>\Rightarrow</m> ODE</title>
			<p>
				📌 Since this course only covers <em>ordinary differential equations</em>, any time we say <em>differential equation</em> or <em>DE</em>, we mean <em>ODE</em>.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			So, for an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include two things:
			First, it requires a derivative, such as <m>f'</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
			Second, it must have an equal sign.
		</p>

		<p>
			This means all of the following are differential equations:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime).
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			On the other hand, these are not differential equations, either because they do not contain a derivative or because they do not include an equals sign:
			<me>\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0.</me>

			In this text, we will use several common notations for derivatives. These include prime notation, such as <m>y'</m> or <m>y''</m>; Leibniz notation, written as <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>; and dot notation, typically reserved for derivatives with respect to time.
