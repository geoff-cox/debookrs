		Many times, a quantity is connected to how it changes (its derivative). When these connections are expressed mathematically, they result in a differential equation. For example, consider this statement:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>The rate of change of a function is equal to the function itself.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>
		Mathematically, if we give this function a name, say <m>y</m>, this statement can be transformed into a differential equation, as shown.
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>The <m>\color{blue}\underset{y^\prime}{\fbox{rate of change of a function}}</m> <m>\underset{=}{\fbox{is equal}}</m> to the <m>\color{green}\underset{y}{\fbox{function}}</m> itself.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		<me> y' = y. </me>
	</p>

	<p>
		A <q>solution</q> to this differential equation would be any function equal to its own derivative. Do you know a function like that?
		<fn>Since <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^x\right] = e^x</m> then <m>y=e^x</m> is a solution!</fn>  
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is another example from physics: 
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>A force acting on an object is equal to the object's mass (constant) multiplied by its acceleration.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>
		If we let <m>F(t)</m> be the force on the object, <m>y(t)</m> be the position of the object, and remembering that acceleration is the second derivative of position, then this statement can be written as the differential equation
		<me> F(t) = mass \cdot y''(t) </me>.
		The solution to this differential equation would involve finding the position function <m>y(t)</m>.
