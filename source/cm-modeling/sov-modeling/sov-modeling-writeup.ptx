<title> Write-Up </title>  

	<p>
		Write a report that includes the mathematical solutions and ideas above, presented seamlessly. This should not as numbered or lettered problems, nor as a bulleted list, but as a report with an introduction to the concept, the meaning of the equations, how they are solved, and how the differential equation can be adapted in the three different scenarios - dice roll, fewer stations, more students infected initially.
	</p>

	<p>
		At a minimum, you should do the following.
		<ul>
			<li>
				Have an introduction to the concept. This is the part where you tell the reader why this topic matters and who cares. Also, explain to the reader what is going to be in the report they are about to read.
			</li>

			<li>
				Describe the differential equation(s), and why they represent the scenario(s).
			</li>

			<li>
				Explain the meaning of the critical numbers.
			</li>

			<li>
				Explain what the parameters in your model mean, and how they change if the scenario(s) change, specifically in the three scenarios (dice rolled, fewer stations, more students infected initially)
			</li>

			<li>
				Include the math you used to get your general and particular solutions. You may hand-write this part and include it as an appendix, referring to it in the text of your paper.
			</li>

			<li>
				Include your plot(s). Include a title, a legend, etc.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Include a summary/conclusion.
			</li>

		</ul>
