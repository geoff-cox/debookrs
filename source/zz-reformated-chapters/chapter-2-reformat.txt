    <title> Direct Integration </title>
    <overview>Presents the first solving technique: when a derivative is isolated, integrate to find the solution.</overview>

    <section-summary>
      <ul>
        <li>Many differential equations reduce to antiderivative problems you’ve already solved in calculus.</li>
        <li>Integrating both sides removes the derivative and allows you to isolate y.</li>

  <formula>Solution types: General → contains constants; Particular → constants fixed; Family → all possible particular solutions.</formula>
  <workflow>Verify → Classify (general/particular) → Apply initial conditions → Integrate if applicable</workflow>
  <alerts>Don’t forget to combine constants when integrating and to check that the proposed function actually satisfies the DE.</alerts>
