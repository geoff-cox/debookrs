  <title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
  <label>chap-integrating-factor</label>
  <overview>Introduces the integrating factor method for solving first-order linear differential equations, beginning with reversing the product rule, understanding integrating factors, and culminating in a systematic method for solving these equations.</overview>
  <dependencies>Requires understanding of derivatives, the product rule, and basic first-order differential equation concepts.</dependencies>
</METADATA>

<overview>
  <p>Some differential equations can be solved by cleverly multiplying by the right function. This chapter explains why that works: we start by reviewing the product rule and running it in reverse, introduce integrating factors, and build a repeatable method for solving first-order linear equations.</p>

  <formula>Integrating Factor: μ(x) = e^{∫P(x) dx}</formula>
  <workflow>Standard form → Find μ(x) → Multiply → Group as derivative → Integrate → Solve for y</workflow>
  <alerts>Always rewrite the equation in standard form first. Constants in μ(x) can be ignored since they don’t affect the final solution.</alerts>
