			Many systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) can be understood as a collection of independent first-order equations. In this section, we will explore the foundations of systems of ODEs, starting with uncoupled systems and moving on to coupled systems. We will also introduce the concept of a phase plane, which is a powerful tool for visualizing the behavior of systems of ODEs. By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of how to analyze and visualize systems of ODEs.

	<subsection label="uncoupled-systems"><title> Two Independent Differential Equations </title>

		<p>
			Let's begin with a system of two first-order differential equations that actually have nothing to do with each other. There are two dependent variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, but they are separated into their own equations. For example, consider:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x	\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 0.6 </mrow>
			<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 1.2 </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			These are called <em>uncoupled</em> because the <m>dx/dt</m> equation doesn't contain <m>y</m>, and the <m>dy/dt</m> equation doesn't contain <m>x</m>. There's no interaction between the variables.
		</p>

		<p>
			We already know how to solve each equation on its own. Individually, the solutions are:
		</p>

		<me>
			x(t) = 0.6 e^{-t}
			\quad \text{and} \quad
			y(t) = 1.2 e^{-2t}.
		</me>

		<p>
			However, we generally pair them as a point or vector, such as
		</p>

		<me>
			\left( x(t), y(t) \right) = \left( 0.6 e^{-t} , 1.2 e^{-2t} \right)
		</me>

		<p>
			Even though <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> evolve independently, we can still treat them as a <em>system</em>. Situations like this are more common than you'd think. For example, <m>x(t)</m> could model a cooling cup of coffee, while <m>y(t)</m> tracks a chilled soda warming up, both happening in the same room but without affecting each other.

	<subsection label="partially-coupled-systems"><title> When One Variable Influences the Other </title>
		<p>
			In the previous example, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> changed independently. But what happens if one variable begins to influence the other? Letâ€™s explore a system where <m>x</m> evolves on its own, but <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x		\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 1 </mrow>
			<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y + x	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			This system describes how <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> change over time. <m>x</m> follows a simple decay, while <m>y</m> responds to the current value of <m>x</m>. We can think of <m>x</m> as a driving force and <m>y</m> as the response.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first equation is familiarâ€”itâ€™s just exponential decay. We can solve it right away:
		</p>

		<me>
			x(t) = e^{-t}
		</me>

		<p>
			Once we know <m>x(t)</m>, the second equation becomes:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y + e^{-t}
		</me>

		<p>
			This is a first-order linear equation, which we can solve using an integrating factor.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is called a <em>partially coupled</em> system: <m>x</m> evolves on its own, while <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. It's a one-way interactionâ€”<m>x</m> affects <m>y</m>, but not the other way around.
		</p>

		<exercise label="chkpt-building-up-to-systems-1-2-1"><title> Partial Coupling is One-Way </title>
			<statement correct="yes">
				<p>
					In a partially coupled system, one variable affects the other, but not vice versa.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<feedback>
				<p>
					Exactly. In these systems, one equation is independent and can be solved first. The second equation depends on the first.
				</p>
			</feedback>
		</exercise>

		<p>
			This situation can model real-world problems where one process drives another. For example, suppose <m>x(t)</m> represents the light entering a greenhouse, and <m>y(t)</m> models plant growth. The light level doesnâ€™t depend on the plant, but the plantâ€™s growth rate depends on both its current state <m>y</m> and the incoming light <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="ex-partial-coupling"><title> A Partially Coupled System </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Solve the partially coupled system:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x		\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 1 </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y + x	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					This system is partially coupled: the equation for <m>x</m> is independent, while <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. We'll solve it in two steps.
				</p>

				<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Solve the equation for <m>x</m>. This is exponential decay:</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dx}{dt} = -x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x(t) = e^{-t}
				</me>

				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute <m>x(t)</m> into the equation for <m>y</m>:</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y + e^{-t}
				</me>

				<p>
					This is a linear equation. Weâ€™ll solve it using an integrating factor. First, write it in standard form:
				</p>

				<me>
					y' + 2y = e^{-t}, \quad \mu(t) = e^{2t}
				</me>

				<p>
					Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:
				</p>

				<me>
					e^{2t} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} + 2e^{2t} y = e^{t}
				</me>

				<p>
					The left-hand side is the derivative of <m>e^{2t} y</m>:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{2t} y \right) = e^t
				</me>

				<p>
					Integrate both sides:
				</p>

				<me>
					e^{2t} y = \int e^t\, dt = e^t + C
				</me>

				<p>
					Solve for <m>y(t)</m>:
				</p>

				<me>
					y(t) = e^{-t} + C e^{-2t}
				</me>

				<p>
					Use the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>:
				</p>

				<me>
					0 = 1 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = -1
				</me>

				<p>
					So the full solution is:
				</p>

				<me>
					\begin{aligned}
					x(t) \amp = e^{-t} \\
					y(t) \amp = e^{-t} - e^{-2t}
					\end{aligned}
				</me>

				<p>
					The function <m>x(t)</m> decays smoothly, while <m>y(t)</m> is temporarily lifted by <m>x(t)</m> before decaying to zero. This kind of response is typical in systems where one variable drives the other without feedback.
