		As you might expect, solving differential equations becomes more challenging as the order of the derivative increases. However, <term>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</term> (LHCC equations) are the exception since they are not only approachable, but also generalize well across many different disciplines in science and engineering.

		We will begin by identifying what makes an equation linear, homogeneous, and constant coefficient, ensuring a clear understanding of the terminology and structure. From there, we will develop systematic methods to find general solutions, leveraging the characteristic equation to determine the form of solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid grasp of how to approach and solve LHCC equations, preparing you for further exploration into nonhomogeneous cases and applied problem-solving.
