		As you might expect, solving differential equations becomes more challenging as the order of the derivative increases. But don't worry! There's a class of higher-order equations that are not only approachable but also serve as a gateway to more advanced topics. These are known as linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC for short.

	<p>
		In this chapter, we will learn how to identify LHCC equations and explore a method to solve them by connecting them to a polynomial equation, called the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this section, you'll see how solving higher-order equations can be as simple as finding the roots of a polynomial.

		As we move beyond first-order equations, a natural question arises: how do we systematically solve higher-order differential equations? 
		While increasing the order may seem daunting, certain classes of equations possess structures that make them highly approachable. 
		One such class is <em>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</em>, often abbreviated as <term>LHCC equations</term>.

		LHCC equations appear in numerous physical and mathematical applications, from modeling oscillations in mechanical systems to analyzing 
		electrical circuits and population dynamics. Their solutions reveal underlying patterns of exponential growth, decay, and oscillation, 
		making them a fundamental topic in differential equations.

		This chapter introduces a systematic approach to solving LHCC equations. The key idea is to transform a differential equation into an 
		algebraic equation—known as the <term>characteristic equation</term>—which determines the behavior of the solutions. By the end of this 
		chapter, you will see that solving these higher-order equations can be as simple as finding the roots of a polynomial.

		In this chapter, we will explore a special class of differential equations known as <term>linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations</term>. 
		These equations are a subset of linear differential equations with constant coefficients, which have a rich theory and many applications in science and engineering. 
		We will learn how to solve these equations using a variety of methods, including the characteristic equation, undetermined coefficients, and variation of parameters. 
		By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of LHCC equations and be able to solve them with confidence.
