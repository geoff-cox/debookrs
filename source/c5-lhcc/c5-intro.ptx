		Solving differential equations can become increasingly complex when dealing with higher-order derivatives. However, linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations) are notable for being more accessible and widely applicable across various scientific and engineering disciplines.

		In this chapter, we will define key terms such as <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Following that, we will explore systematic methods for finding the general solutions using the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to solve LHCC equations, providing a solid foundation for further study of their nonhomogeneous counterparts.
