	<introduction>

		<p>
			Before we explore methods for solving <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, it is essential to understand their fundamental structure. These equations play a significant role in mathematical modeling because their solutions exhibit predictable and well-behaved patterns, making them ideal for applications in physics, engineering, and other sciences.
		</p>

		<p>
			To build intuition, we will carefully examine the three defining properties of LHCC equations: <term>linearity</term>, <term>homogeneity</term>, and <term>constant coefficients</term>. Each of these characteristics influences the types of solutions that emerge and dictates the methods we use to solve them. By clearly defining and identifying LHCC equations, we lay the groundwork for developing powerful solution techniques in the sections that follow.

		<p>
			By the end of this section, you will be able to recognize and classify LHCC equations, setting the stage for understanding why exponential functions serve as their fundamental solutions. This understanding will provide the necessary framework to systematically analyze and solve these equations in later chapters.

	<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				To solve a differential equation effectively, we must first determine its structural properties. The term "LHCC" highlights three key characteristics: <term>linearity</term>, <term>homogeneity</term>, and <term>constant coefficients</term>. Understanding these properties is crucial because they dictate both the nature of the solutions and the methods used to obtain them.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we break down each component of an LHCC equation, providing clear definitions and illustrative examples. By the end, you will be equipped with the ability to classify differential equations based on these properties, distinguishing LHCC equations from other types.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC: Linearity </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall, a differential equation is considered <term>linear</term> if it only contains linear terms. In other words, the dependent variable and all its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied or composed with each other. In contrast, an equation is <term>nonlinear</term> if it contains terms such as <m>y^2</m>, <m>(y')^3</m>, <m>\sin(y)</m>, or <m>y \cdot y''</m>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The general form of an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation is:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{

				}}	+ \cdots +
				\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y'			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{

			<p>
				where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions of the independent variable <m>x</m>. <m>f(x)</m> is also commonly known as the <term>forcing function</term> or <term>nonhomogeneous term</term>.

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>H</q> in LHCC: Homogeneous </title>

			<p>
				A linear differential equation is classified as <term>homogeneous</term> if its right-hand side (the constant term <m>f(x)</m>) is zero. Otherwise, it is classified as <term>nonhomogeneous</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the following equations are homogeneous
			</p>

			<me>
				x y'' - \cos x y' + 6y = 0, \qquad y''' + 2y'' = y'

			<p>

			<me>
				y'' + 4xy = \boxed{x}, \qquad y' + \boxed{e^x} = 0
			</me>
			
			<p>
				are nonhomogeneous because the (boxed) contant terms are not zero.

				A linear differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term> if all coefficient functions <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants rather than functions of <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some linear differential equations with constant coefficients are

			<me>
				2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x

			</p>

			<me>
				\boxed{3^x}\ y'' + \boxed{2x}\ y' + y = 0, \qquad y'' + y' + \boxed{\ln x}\ y = \sin x
			</me>.

		<subsubsection><title> Summary: Recognizing LHCC Equations </title>
			
			<p>
				Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="def-lhcc"><title>LHCC Equation</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:

				</statement>
			</definition>
			
			<p>
				The following equations are examples of LHCC equations:
			</p>

			<me>
				2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = 0 \qquad u'' = u

		</subsubsection>

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="lhcc-equation">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
				<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
				<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
				intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

	<subsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Having established the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, we now turn our attention to their solutions. Unlike many other types of differential equations, the structure of these equations lead to a predictable set of solutions that take the form of exponential functions.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we will explore why exponentials naturally emerge as solutions and how this insight allows us to construct general solutions. By the end of this section, you will see that solving an LHCC equation ultimately reduces to finding the right exponential functions whose combinations satisfy the given equation.
			</p>

		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> What Do Solutions Look Like? </title>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					When encountering a new type of differential equation for the first time, a natural question to ask is: <em>What kind of functions make sense to plug in for <m>y</m>?</em> To answer this, you must look at the structure of the equation to get clues as to which functions are compatible with the equation. So our plan for this section is to examine how the structure of LHCC equations suggest that exponential solutions (<xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">Property 1</xref>) are valid options, while other common function types are not.
				</p>

			</introduction>

			<p>
				One way to see which functions make good candidates for solutions to LHCC equation is through the lens of <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom"><term>like terms</term></xref>. In algebra, like terms share the same structure and when you add them together they can be combined into a single term. The same idea applies to differential equations: if a function <m>y(x)</m> is a solution, then after substituting <m>y(x)</m> and its derivatives into a homogeneous equation, all terms must combine in a way that results in zero (i.e., they all cancel out). <m>^üìå</m>
				<aside>
					<p>
						<term>üìå Note:</term> We are using <q>like terms</q> to represent the more advanced notion of linearly dependent functions.
					</p>
				</aside>
			</p>

			<p>
				To illustrate this idea, consider the simple first-order LHCC equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y' - 2y = 0
			</me>.

			<p>
				To be a solution, any function of <m>x</m> that we plug in for <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> must result in <m>0 = 0</m>. This implies that, after plugging in <m>y</m>, all the terms on the left cancel out. However, the only functions that can simplify in this way are <q>like terms</q>!
			</p>

			<p>
				Looking back at our equation, we see that for <m>y(x)</m> to be a solution, the terms <m>y'</m> and <m>2y</m> must be like terms, meaning they must have the same functional form so that they can cancel out. This leads us to a fundamental question:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>Which types of functions retain their form when differentiated?</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is always another exponential function. This suggests that exponentials might be the right type of function to satisfy LHCC equations. Let's test this by substituting different function types into our example equation:
			</p>

			<p>
				As we can see, only the exponential function <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that fully cancel out. This provides evidence that exponentials are a natural choice for solutions to LHCC equations. Let's look at one more example to solidify this idea.
			</p>

						First, let's check the first two exponential functions:

			</example>

			<p>
				But what about other functions, such as sine and cosine? Interestingly, trigonometric functions also satisfy certain LHCC equations, but they are actually a special case of exponentials when complex numbers are involved. This will become clearer when we explore the <em>characteristic equation</em> in a later section.
			</p>
			
			<conclusion>

				<p>
					In this subsection, we discovered that exponential functions are the natural solutions to LHCC equations because they retain their form when differentiated. We will build on this idea in the next section by constructing the <em>general solution</em> from all the known exponential solutions.

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The General Solution </title>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					Now that we know that exponential functions naturally satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations, we will discuss how to combine these exponential solutions to form the general solution.
				</p>

			</introduction>

			<p>
				The general solution to an LHCC equation is established based on the <q><xref ref="lhcc-soln-properties" text="title"/></q> mentioned in the introduction along with a key property of linear differential equations known as the <term>principle of superposition</term>. This principle states that if <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to a linear equation, then so is <m>c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2</m>, for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. To understand this, let's illustrate these properties on the equation from a previous example. 
			</p>

			<p>
				In <xref ref="lhcc-soln-example-1"/>, we determined the LHCC equation,
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0
			</me>

			<p>
				has two solutions, <m>y_1 = e^{4x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{-x}</m>. Since this equation has 2nd order, we expect exactly two solutions. Therefore, our two exponential solutions from <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">property 1</xref> have been established.
			</p>

			<p>
				<xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-2" text="custom">Property 2</xref> tells us that our exponential solutions, <m>y_1 = e^{4x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{-x}</m> cannot be like terms. This is true, since they have different exponents and cannot be combined into a single term with addition. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-3" text="custom">property 3</xref> (principle of superposition) leads to the general solution,
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 e^{4x} + c_2 e^{-x}
			</me>.

			<p>
				In general, as long as we have the <m>n</m> independent exponential solutions, <m>y_1</m>, <m>y_2</m>, <m>\dots</m>, <m>y_n</m> of the form <xref ref="lhcc-soln-form"/>, then the general solution is,
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 + \cdots + c_n y_n
			</me>

			<p>
				for any constants <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m>. 
			</p>

			<conclusion>
				<p>
					This shows how to construct the general solution to any LHCC equation given the exponential functions that satisfy the equation. In the next section, we will explore how to find these exponential solutions through finding the roots of a polynomial equation called the characteristic equation.
				</p>

		<subsubsection><title> General Solution </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Now that we understand why exponential functions naturally satisfy Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) differential equations, the next step is to construct the <em>general solution</em>. Since these equations are linear, their solutions exhibit a crucial property: any linear combination of solutions is also a solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					This principle, known as the <em>superposition principle</em>, allows us to build a complete solution by combining multiple independent exponential solutions. In this subsection, we will apply this principle to construct the general form of the solution to an LHCC equation.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<p>
				The <em>superposition principle</em> states that if <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to a linear differential equation, then their linear combination
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2
			</me>

			<p>
				is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. This property extends to higher-order LHCC equations, where the general solution consists of a sum of all independent exponential solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				To illustrate this, let‚Äôs return to a second-order example:
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				We previously determined that the functions <m>y_1 = e^{4x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{-x}</m> are solutions. Since they are independent, the general solution takes the form:
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 e^{4x} + c_2 e^{-x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				For an <em>n</em>-th order LHCC equation, we follow the same reasoning. If we identify <em>n</em> independent exponential solutions <m>y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n</m>, the general solution is:
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 + \cdots + c_n y_n,
			</me>

			<p>
				where <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m> are arbitrary constants. The number of independent solutions always matches the order of the equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				To summarize:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> Each LHCC equation has <em>n</em> independent solutions. </li>
				<li> The general solution is a <em>linear combination</em> of these solutions. </li>
				<li> The constants <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m> account for different initial conditions. </li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				In the next section, we will explore a systematic method for finding the exponential solutions, called the <em>characteristic equation</em>.

				In this section, we developed a framework for understanding the solutions of Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) differential equations. We saw that the key to solving these equations lies in identifying functions that retain their form when differentiated‚Äîleading us to <em>exponential solutions</em>.

				Through the <em>superposition principle</em>, we established that the general solution consists of a <em>linear combination</em> of independent solutions. This means that solving an LHCC equation is ultimately about determining the correct set of exponentials that satisfy the equation.

This algebraic approach allows us to determine the exponential solutions efficiently and will serve as the backbone of our solution methods moving forward.

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			In this section, we have established the foundation for understanding <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</em> differential equations. We began by identifying their key structural components‚Äî<em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>‚Äîwhich define their form and behavior.
		</p>

		<p>
			From there, we explored how these properties influence the types of solutions LHCC equations can have. The most important insight is that exponential functions naturally emerge as solutions due to their unique differentiation properties. This allows us to reduce complex differential equations to algebraic ones, paving the way for systematic solution methods.
		</p>

		<p>
			With this understanding in place, we are now ready to develop practical techniques for solving LHCC equations. In the next section, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a powerful tool that enables us to find solutions efficiently. By applying this method, we will unlock a general approach for solving LHCC equations of any order.
