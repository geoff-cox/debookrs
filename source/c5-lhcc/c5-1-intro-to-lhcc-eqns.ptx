	<introduction>

		<p>
			In this subsection, we take our first steps into understanding <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations. 
			Before we fully define and analyze these equations, it is important to explore their fundamental building blocks: 
			<term>linearity</term> and <term>constant coefficients</term>. These two properties determine the structure of LHCC equations 
			and play a crucial role in their solutions.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, we will examine what it means for a differential equation to be <em>linear</em>. This means that the dependent variable 
			and its derivatives appear in a straightforward manner‚Äîwithout being raised to powers, multiplied together, or appearing inside 
			nonlinear functions such as exponentials or trigonometric expressions. Next, we will define what it means for a differential equation 
			to have <em>constant coefficients</em>‚Äîwhere the coefficients of each derivative remain fixed rather than varying with the independent variable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we establish these two ideas, we will formally introduce <term>Linear Constant Coefficient (LCC)</term> equations, 
			which form the foundation for studying LHCC equations. Finally, we will distinguish between <em>homogeneous</em> and <em>nonhomogeneous</em> equations, 
			a key classification that influences solution techniques.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the end of this subsection, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying LHCC equations,

	<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Before we develop methods for solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations), 
				we first need to understand what these equations look like and how to recognize them. 
				The term "LHCC" captures three essential characteristics: <em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>. 
				Let's break these down one by one.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we've tackled some foundational techniques for solving differential equations, it's time to introduce a new type: linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC equations for short. But how do we recognize them? Let's break down each part of the term <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em> to understand these equations fully.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall, a differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if it can be written as 
				<me>
					\text{Sum of Linear Terms } = \text{ Constant Term}
				</me>
				where a term is linear if it contains, at most, a single dependent variable raised to power of one and not inside another function. The constant term is the collection of all terms that do not contain a dependent variable. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So, every <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation can be organized as follows:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{ 
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_n(x)}	}}\ y^{(n)}
				}}	+ \cdots +
				\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y'			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_1(x)}	}}\ y'
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_0(x)}	}}\ y
				}}	=
				\us{	\large\text{term}			}{ 
				\us{	\large\text{constant }		}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{f(x)}	}}
				}}
			</men>

			<p>
				where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples of <m>\quad</m> 
				<xref ref="linear-equation-examples" text="custom">		üëâ Linear Equations		</xref> <m>\quad</m> 
				<xref ref="nonlinear-equation-examples" text="custom">	üëâ Nonlinear Equations	</xref>
			</p>

			
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>CC</q> in LHCC </title>

			<p>
				A linear differential equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term> if all of the coefficients in the equation are constant (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>). 
				<aside>
					<p>
						‚òùÔ∏è <term>Remember!</term> Constant terms are not coefficients.
					</p>
				</aside>
				This condition results in dropping <q><m>(x)</m></q> on each coefficient in equation <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, every linear differential equation with constant coefficients has the form
			</p>

			<men xml:id="constant-coefficient-de">
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x),
			</men>

			<p>
				where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants. Here are some examples of linear differential equations with constant coefficients:
			</p>

			<me>
				2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
			</me>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>H</q> in LHCC </title>

			<p>
				To state that a linear differential equation is <term>homogeneous</term> is to say that the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, is zero. When the constant is nonzero (i.e., <m>f(x) \neq 0</m>), we say the equation is <term>nonhomogeneous</term>. Therefore, setting <m>f(x) = 0</m> in <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/> leads to the form for any linear homogeneous differential equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="homogeneous-de">
				a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0.
			</men>

			<p>
				This condition implies that every term in the equation must involve the dependent variable <m>y</m> or one of its derivatives. 
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> LHCC Equations </title>
			
			<p>
				Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
				<title>LHCC Equation</title>
				<statement>
				<p>
					A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
				</p>
				<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
				</men>
				<p>
					where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
				</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			
			<p>
				Since LHCC equations are the types of equations that our next method will solve, let's make sure we can identify these equations with an example.
			</p>
			
		</subsubsection>

		<example>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s
					</me>
					<p>
						Determine which of the following equations have constant coefficients.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad
						\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad
						s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
					</me>
					<p>
						For each of the following differential equations, identify the coefficients and state whether they are constants or functions of the independent variable:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li> <m>y'' + 4y' + 6y = 0</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>x^2 y'' + xy' + y = \ln(x)</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>u'' + 2xu' + u = 5x</m>. </li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{BurntOrange} -3x^2}, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}
						</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.
					</p>
				</solution>

						The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="constant-coefficient-de">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
				<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
				<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
				intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

	<!-- <subsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title> -->

		<!-- <introduction>

			<p>
				Now that we understand the structure of linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, we turn our attention 
				to their solutions. A natural question arises: <q>What types of functions satisfy these equations?</q> 
				While differential equations in general may have a variety of solutions, we will see that LHCC equations 
				have solutions that follow a specific pattern‚Äîexponential functions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now that we have established the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, 
				the next step is to explore how to solve them. While differential equations can sometimes have complex or unpredictable solutions, 
				LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions follow a systematic and predictable pattern, making them easier to analyze.
			</p>

			<p>
				The key insight in solving LHCC equations is recognizing that their solutions are often <em>exponential functions</em>. 
				By assuming solutions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, we can transform a differential equation into an algebraic equation known as the 
				<term>characteristic equation</term>. Solving this equation gives us values for <m>r</m>, which in turn determine the form of the 
				general solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we will explore why exponentials naturally arise as solutions, develop techniques for solving LHCC equations systematically, 
				and examine how different types of characteristic roots‚Äîreal, repeated, and complex‚Äîaffect the nature of the solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of the solution process for LHCC equations, enabling you to solve them efficiently 
				and interpret their behavior in various applied contexts.

		</introduction> -->

		<!-- <subsubsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

			<p>
				Before diving into how to solve <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>, let's develop some intuition about what the solutions should look like. For this discussion we will assume that the equations contain a <m>y</m> term. If they didn't, then you could repeatedly integrate both sides of the equation until you are left with a <m>y</m> term and a nonhomogeneous equation.
				<fn>
					For example, the following shows how an LHCC equation with no <m>y</m> term can be reduced to a nonhomogeneous equation with a <m>y</m> term.
					<md>
						<mrow> y''' - 2y'' = 0 \ \ \rightarrow \ \ (y' - 2y)''	=\amp\ 0 \quad \text{(direct integration x2)}	</mrow>
						<mrow> (y' - 2y)'										=\amp\ c_1										</mrow>
						<mrow> y' - 2y											=\amp\ c_1x + c_2								</mrow>
					</md>.
				</fn>
			</p>

			<p>
				We begin with the simple first-order LHCC equation,
				<men xml:id="lhcc-intro-de">
					y' - 2 y = 0
				</men>
				and note that this equation requires <m>y' - 2y</m> to sum to zero. Recall from algebra that only <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom">like terms</xref> can combine to simplify to zero.
				So, for the equation to hold, <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m> must be like terms.
			</p>

			<theorem xml:id="like-terms"><title>Like Terms</title>

				<p>
					Terms are called <term>like terms</term> if they have identical variable parts. That is, they differ only by a coefficient. Like terms can be combined via addition and subtraction. For example, the <m>x^2</m> and <m>e^{-3x}</m> terms below are pairs of like terms, which can be combined as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow> \underline{3x^2} + \underline{\underline{5e^{-3x}}} - 2 + \underline{7x^2} - \underline{\underline{4e^{-3x}}}</mrow>
						<mrow> \underline{10x^2} + \underline{\underline{e^{-3x}}} - 2 </mrow>
					</md>.
				</p>

			</theorem>

			<p>
				Let's test a few guesses for <m>y</m>:
				<m>y = x^2</m>, <m>y = 2 \ln x</m>, and <m>y = e^{2x}</m>.
			</p>

			<sidebyside widths="30% 40% 30%">
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> \left[x^2\right]' - 2 \left[x^2\right] = 0 </mrow>
						<mrow> \ub{2x - 2x^2}_{\text{not like terms}} = 0 </mrow>

					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				As you can see, only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that simplify to zero. This is why exponential functions often work well in LHCC equations. Let's now examine a more complex example to expand on this idea.
			</p>

			<example>
				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Consider the LHCC equation:
						</p>
						<me>
							y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0.
						</me>
						<p>
							Verify that <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution, but <m>y = x^4</m> is not.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Let's check each function:
					</p>
					<sidebyside>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> 	[e^{4x}]'' - 3\left[e^{4x}\right]' - 4\left[e^{4x}\right]	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
								<mrow>

							</md>
						</p>
						<p>

							</md>
						</p>
					</sidebyside>
					<p>
						Therefore, only <m>y = e^{-4x}</m> is a solution.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				This example further supports the claim that exponential functions, like <m>e^{rx}</m>, are well-suited for LHCC equations because they produce like terms when differentiated. Later, we will see that if <m>e^{rx}</m> is a solution then, in some cases, it is possible for <m>xe^{rx}</m> to be a solution as well.
			</p>

			<p>
				We conclude this section with an important concept that will guide us in the sections to follow.
				<assemblage><title> Terms of the Solution to an LHCC Equation </title>
					<p>
						The general solution to an LHCC equation involves terms of the form:
						<me> e^{rx}, \quad \ub{xe^{rx}, \quad x^2e^{rx}, \quad x^3e^{rx},\  \ldots}_{\text{For Special Cases}} </me>

		<!-- <subsubsection><title> What Do Solutions to LHCC Equations Look Like? </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Before we develop a systematic approach to solving linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, 
					it helps to build intuition about the nature of their solutions. Instead of jumping straight into formulas, 
					let's explore what kind of functions naturally satisfy these equations.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Now that we understand the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, 
					we turn our attention to their solutions. What kinds of functions satisfy these equations? How do we determine the general form of solutions?
				</p>

				<p>
					Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a highly structured solution method. 
					Their solutions take on a predictable form, allowing us to develop a systematic approach for solving them. 
					Through examples and analysis, we will discover that <em>exponential functions</em> play a central role in solving LHCC equations. 
					By assuming solutions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m> and substituting into the equation, we obtain an algebraic equation for <m>r</m>‚Äîthe <em>characteristic equation</em>. 
					The solutions to this characteristic equation directly determine the general solution to the differential equation.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this subsection, we will explore why exponentials naturally arise as solutions, examine what happens when different types of characteristic roots appear, 
					and build an intuitive understanding of why other function types (such as polynomials or trigonometric functions) do not generally satisfy LHCC equations. 
					By the end of this discussion, you will have a clear picture of what solutions to LHCC equations look like and why they take the forms they do.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<p>
				Consider the first-order LHCC equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="lhcc-simple-example">
				y' - 2y = 0.
			</men>

			<p>
				We are looking for a function <m>y(x)</m> such that its derivative <m>y'</m> is proportional to <m>y</m> itself. 
				A natural guess is an exponential function:
			</p>

			<me>
				y = e^{rx}.
			</me>

			<p>
				Substituting this into the equation gives:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> r e^{rx} - 2 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
				<mrow> (r - 2) e^{rx} = 0. </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the only way for this equation to hold is if <m>r - 2 = 0</m>, or <m>r = 2</m>. 
				This means <m>y = e^{2x}</m> is a solution to the differential equation.
			</p>

			<example><title> Testing Different Solution Forms </title>
				<p>
					Let's try a few other functions and see if they satisfy the equation <xref ref="lhcc-simple-example"/>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Consider the following possible solutions:
				</p>
				<me>
					1.\quad y = x^2
				</me>
				<me>
					2.\quad y = \sin x
				</me>
				<me>
					3.\quad y = e^{2x}
				</me>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Calculating the derivatives and substituting into <xref ref="lhcc-simple-example"/>:
					</p>
					<sidebyside>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> \left[x^2\right]' - 2\left[x^2\right] = 2x - 2x^2 \neq 0 </mrow>

							</md>
						</p>
					</sidebyside>

					<p>
						Only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> satisfies the equation. This confirms that exponential functions are 
						well-suited for LHCC equations.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				The reason exponentials work is because their derivatives maintain the same functional form. 
				This means that if we assume a solution of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, we can derive an algebraic 
				equation for <m>r</m> that determines the general solution.
			</p>

			<assemblage><title> Key Takeaways </title>
				<ul>
					<li> Solutions to LHCC equations often take the form <m>e^{rx}</m>, where <m>r</m> is a constant. </li>
					<li> Exponential functions are useful because their derivatives preserve the same structure. </li>
					<li> By substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for <m>r</m>, 
						known as the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which determines the solution structure. </li>
				</ul>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				In the next section, we formalize this idea by deriving the characteristic equation, which allows us to 
				solve LHCC equations systematically.

		<!-- <subsubsection><title> Why Exponentials? </title>

			<p>
				In this section, we explore what kinds of functions satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations.
				While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions
				are always exponential functions. We will see why this is true by examining concrete examples and using the concept of

			<paragraphs><title> A Simple Example </title>

				<p>
					Consider the first-order LHCC equation:

					also a solution. That is, the function:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x}
				</me>

				<p>
					is also a valid solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. We verify this by substituting <m>y</m> into the equation 
					<xref ref="second-order-example"/>.
				</p>

				<example><title> Verifying the Superposition Principle </title>

					<p>
						Let's check that <m>y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x}</m> satisfies the equation <xref ref="second-order-example"/>.
					</p>

					<solution>
						<p>
							First, we compute derivatives:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> y' = 2c_1 e^{2x} + 3c_2 e^{3x} </mrow>
							<mrow> y'' = 4c_1 e^{2x} + 9c_2 e^{3x} </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Substituting into <xref ref="second-order-example"/>:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> (4c_1 e^{2x} + 9c_2 e^{3x}) - 5(2c_1 e^{2x} + 3c_2 e^{3x}) + 6(c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x}) = 0 </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Expanding and simplifying:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> 4c_1 e^{2x} + 9c_2 e^{3x} - 10c_1 e^{2x} - 15c_2 e^{3x} + 6c_1 e^{2x} + 6c_2 e^{3x} = 0 </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Grouping like terms:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> (4c_1 - 10c_1 + 6c_1) e^{2x} + (9c_2 - 15c_2 + 6c_2) e^{3x} = 0 </mrow>
							<mrow> 0 e^{2x} + 0 e^{3x} = 0. </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Since the equation holds for all values of <m>x</m>, we conclude that <m>y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x}</m> is a solution. 
							This confirms that combining solutions preserves validity.

			<paragraphs><title> The General Solution </title>

				<p>
					Since the two solutions <m>y_1 = e^{2x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{3x}</m> are independent, their linear combination 
					represents the most general solution to the equation. We express this as:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x},
				</me>

				<p>
					where <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> are arbitrary constants. The number of independent solutions corresponds to the 
					order of the differential equation. For a second-order equation, we expect two independent solutions, leading to 
					a two-parameter general solution.

				<ul>
					<li> An LHCC equation often has multiple exponential solutions, determined by solving the characteristic equation. </li>
					<li> The principle of superposition states that any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. </li>
					<li> The general solution is formed by summing all independent exponential solutions with arbitrary coefficients. </li>
				</ul>
			</outcomes>

			<p>
				Now that we understand why solutions combine, the next step is to formalize the characteristic equation, which provides 
				a systematic way to determine all possible solutions.
