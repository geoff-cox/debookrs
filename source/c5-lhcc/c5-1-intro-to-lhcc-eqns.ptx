	<subsection><title> Homogeneous &amp; Constant Coefficients </title>
		
		<p>
			Now that we've tackled some foundational techniques for solving differential equations, it's time to introduce a new type: linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC equations for short. But how do we recognize them? Let's break down each part of the term <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em> to understand these equations fully.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			First, recall that a <term>linear differential equation</term> looks like this:
			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
				\os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x).}}
			</men>
			The key idea here is that each term involves either a derivative of <m>y</m> or <m>y</m> itself, all multiplied by coefficients that depend on <m>x</m>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Next, the equation is <term>homogeneous</term> if the constant term is zero, meaning <m>f(x) = 0</m>. This ensures the left-hand side of the equation equals zero.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Finally, if all the coefficients are constants (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>), the equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
		</p>
		
		<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
			<title>LHCC Equation</title>
			<statement>
			<p>
				A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
			</p>
			<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
			</men>
			<p>
				where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
			</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		
		<p>
			Now that we have the definition, let's make sure we can identify these equations with a few examples.
		</p>
		
		<example>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s
					</me>
					<p>
						Determine which of the following equations have constant coefficients.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad
						\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad
						s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
					</me>
					<p>
						For each of the following differential equations, identify the coefficients and state whether they are constants or functions of the independent variable:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li> <m>y'' + 4y' + 6y = 0</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>x^2 y'' + xy' + y = \ln(x)</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>u'' + 2xu' + u = 5x</m>. </li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = {\color{blue} 0}, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{blue} -3x^2}, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{blue} 0}
						</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.
					</p>
				</solution>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Check if each coefficient is constant:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{3}}} y'' -
							\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{2\tau}}}\ y' +
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} y = \tau, \quad
							\sqrt{t} -
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} \frac{dP}{dt} -
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{1}{2}}}} P^2 = 1, \quad
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} s''' =
							\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}} s
						</me>.
						The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.

	<subsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

		<p>
			Before diving into how to solve <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>, let's develop some intuition about what the solutions should look like. For this discussion we will assume that the equations contain a <m>y</m> term. If they didn't, then you could repeatedly integrate both sides of the equation until you are left with a <m>y</m> term and a nonhomogeneous equation.
			<fn>
				For example, the following shows how an LHCC equation with no <m>y</m> term can be reduced to a nonhomogeneous equation with a <m>y</m> term.
				<md>
					<mrow> y''' - 2y'' = 0 \ \ \rightarrow \ \ (y' - 2y)''	=\amp\ 0 \quad \text{(direct integration x2)}	</mrow>
					<mrow> (y' - 2y)'										=\amp\ c_1										</mrow>
					<mrow> y' - 2y											=\amp\ c_1x + c_2								</mrow>
				</md>.
			</fn>
		</p>

		<p>
			We begin with the simple first-order LHCC equation,
			<men xml:id="lhcc-intro-de">
				y' - 2 y = 0
			</men>
			and note that this equation requires <m>y' - 2y</m> to sum to zero. Recall from algebra that only <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom">like terms</xref> can combine to simplify to zero.
			So, for the equation to hold, <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m> must be like terms.
		</p>

		<theorem xml:id="like-terms"><title>Like Terms</title>

			<p>
				Terms are called <term>like terms</term> if they have identical variable parts. That is, they differ only by a coefficient. Like terms can be combined via addition and subtraction. For example, the <m>x^2</m> and <m>e^{-3x}</m> terms below are pairs of like terms, which can be combined as follows:
				<md>
					<mrow> \underline{3x^2} + \underline{\underline{5e^{-3x}}} - 2 + \underline{7x^2} - \underline{\underline{4e^{-3x}}}</mrow>
					<mrow> \underline{10x^2} + \underline{\underline{e^{-3x}}} - 2 </mrow>
				</md>.
			</p>

		</theorem>

		<p>
			Let's test a few guesses for <m>y</m>:
			<m>y = x^2</m>, <m>y = 2 \ln x</m>, and <m>y = e^{2x}</m>.
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="30% 40% 30%">
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[x^2\right]' - 2 \left[x^2\right] = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> \ub{2x - 2x^2}_{\text{not like terms}} = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[2\ln x\right]' - 4\ln x = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> \ub{\frac{2}{x} - 4\ln x}_{\text{not like terms}} = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[e^{2x}\right]' - 2 \left[e^{2x}\right] = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> \ub{2e^{2x} - 2e^{2x}}_{\text{like terms}\, =\, 0} = 0 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			As you can see, only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that simplify to zero. This is why exponential functions often work well in LHCC equations. Let's now examine a more complex example to expand on this idea.
		</p>

		<example>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Consider the LHCC equation:
					</p>
					<me>
						y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0.
					</me>
					<p>
						Verify that <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution, but <m>y = x^4</m> is not.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Let's check each function:
				</p>
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[e^{4x}]'' - 3\left[e^{4x}\right]' - 4\left[e^{4x}\right]	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{like terms simplify to }0}{\ub{
									16e^{4x} - 12e^{4x} - 4e^{4x}	
								}}
								=\amp\ 0	
							</mrow>
							<mrow> 	0	=\amp\ 0	\ \ ✅ </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[x^4]'' - 3\left[x^4\right]' - 4\left[x^4\right]	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{not like terms, do not combine}}{\ub{
									12x^2 - 12x^3 - 4x^4	
								}}
								=\amp\ 0	\ \ ❌
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					Therefore, only <m>y = e^{-4x}</m> is a solution.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			This example further supports the claim that exponential functions, like <m>e^{rx}</m>, are well-suited for LHCC equations because they produce like terms when differentiated. Later, we will see that if <m>e^{rx}</m> is a solution then, in some cases, it is possible for <m>xe^{rx}</m> to be a solution as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			We conclude this section with an important concept that will guide us in the sections to follow.
			<assemblage><title> Terms of the Solution to an LHCC Equation </title>
				<p>
					The general solution to an LHCC equation involves terms of the form:
					<me> e^{rx}, \quad \ub{xe^{rx}, \quad x^2e^{rx}, \quad x^3e^{rx},\  \ldots}_{\text{For Special Cases}} </me>
					where <m>r</m> is a constant. Note, if <m>r</m> is complex, then <m>r=a+\theta i</m>, and by <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="custom">Euler's formula</xref>,
					<me> e^{rx} = e^{(a+\theta i)x} = e^{ax}\cdot e^{\theta i x} = e^{ax}(\cos(bx) + i\sin(bx)) </me>.
					In this case, it is common to see a solution written with sine and cosine terms.
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					When <m>r</m> is complex, then <m>r=a+\theta i</m>, and by <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="custom">Euler's formula</xref>, <m> e^{rx} = e^{(a+\theta i)x} = e^{ax}\cdot e^{\theta i x} = e^{ax}(\cos(bx) + i\sin(bx)) </m>.
					In this case, the general solution may also contain sine and cosine terms.

	<subsection><title> The Characteristic Equation </title>

		<p>
			Solving linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations correspond to finding the roots of a polynomial called the <term>characteristic equation</term>. This equation is derived by substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the LHCC equation and solving for <m>r</m>.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-characteristic-equation00"><title><em>LHCC Characteristic Equation</em></title>

		<theorem xml:id="characteristic-eqn-details00"><title> Where does the Characteristic Equation come from? </title>

				To find the characteristic equation, we substitute <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the <m>n</m>-th order <xref ref="lhcc-equation" text="custom">LHCC equation</xref> and solve for <m>r</m>. Doing this gives us

		<p>
			In general, the characteristic equation will have <m>n</m> roots, which may be real or complex and may also include repeated roots. Each root of the characteristic equation leads to a term in the general solution of the LHCC.

<section><title> Defining LHCC Equations </title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            Before we develop methods for solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations), 
            we first need to understand what these equations look like and how to recognize them. 
            The term "LHCC" captures three essential characteristics: <em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>. 
            Let's break these down one by one.
        </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection><title> Linearity </title>
        <p>
            A differential equation is <term>linear</term> if the dependent variable and all of its derivatives appear in a linear fashion—meaning 
            they are not multiplied together, raised to powers, or embedded inside nonlinear functions (such as trigonometric or exponential functions). 
            In general, an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation has the form:
        </p>

        <men xml:id="general-linear-de">
            a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = f(x),
        </men>

        <p>
            where <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> are coefficient functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>, 
            and <m>f(x)</m> is a given function. Notice that <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear only in the first power and are not multiplied 
            by each other, ensuring linearity.
        </p>

        <example><title> Identifying Linearity </title>
            <p>
                Determine whether the following equations are linear:
            </p>
            <me>
                1.\quad y'' + 3y' - 5y = 0
            </me>
            <me>
                2.\quad y' + y^2 = \sin x
            </me>
            <me>
                3.\quad e^y y'' + y' = 4x
            </me>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The first equation is linear because all terms involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear in the first power and are 
                    not multiplied by each other. The second equation is nonlinear because of the <m>y^2</m> term. The third equation is also 
                    nonlinear because <m>e^y</m> appears as a coefficient, making the equation nonlinear in <m>y</m>.

    <subsection><title> Homogeneity </title>
        <p>
            A linear differential equation is <term>homogeneous</term> if there are no terms that depend only on <m>x</m>. In other words, 
            the right-hand side of the equation must be zero: 
        </p>

        <men xml:id="homogeneous-de">
            a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0.
        </men>

        <p>
            If the right-hand side is nonzero (i.e., <m>f(x) \neq 0</m>), the equation is called <em>nonhomogeneous</em>. 
        </p>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The first equation is homogeneous because the right-hand side is zero. The second equation is nonhomogeneous because the right-hand

    <subsection><title> Constant Coefficients </title>
        <p>
            A linear homogeneous differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term> if the coefficients <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> 
            are all constants rather than functions of <m>x</m>. In other words, an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation has the form:

        <men xml:id="constant-coefficient-de">
            a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0,

                <p>

	<conclusion>
        <p>
            In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="constant-coefficient-de">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
            <li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
            <li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
            intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

<section><title> Building Intuition for LHCC Equations </title>

	<subsection><title> What Do Solutions to LHCC Equations Look Like? </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Before we develop a systematic approach to solving linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, 
				it helps to build intuition about the nature of their solutions. Instead of jumping straight into formulas, 
				let's explore what kind of functions naturally satisfy these equations.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<p>
			Consider the first-order LHCC equation:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="lhcc-simple-example">
			y' - 2y = 0.
		</men>

		<p>
			We are looking for a function <m>y(x)</m> such that its derivative <m>y'</m> is proportional to <m>y</m> itself. 
			A natural guess is an exponential function:
		</p>

		<me>
			y = e^{rx}.
		</me>

		<p>
			Substituting this into the equation gives:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> r e^{rx} - 2 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
			<mrow> (r - 2) e^{rx} = 0. </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the only way for this equation to hold is if <m>r - 2 = 0</m>, or <m>r = 2</m>. 
			This means <m>y = e^{2x}</m> is a solution to the differential equation.
		</p>

		<example><title> Testing Different Solution Forms </title>
			<p>
				Let's try a few other functions and see if they satisfy the equation <xref ref="lhcc-simple-example"/>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider the following possible solutions:
			</p>
			<me>
				1.\quad y = x^2
			</me>
			<me>
				2.\quad y = \sin x
			</me>
			<me>
				3.\quad y = e^{2x}
			</me>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Calculating the derivatives and substituting into <xref ref="lhcc-simple-example"/>:
				</p>
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> \left[x^2\right]' - 2\left[x^2\right] = 2x - 2x^2 \neq 0 </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> \left[\sin x\right]' - 2\left[\sin x\right] = \cos x - 2\sin x \neq 0 </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> \left[e^{2x}\right]' - 2\left[e^{2x}\right] = 2e^{2x} - 2e^{2x} = 0. </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<p>
					Only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> satisfies the equation. This confirms that exponential functions are 
					well-suited for LHCC equations.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			The reason exponentials work is because their derivatives maintain the same functional form. 
			This means that if we assume a solution of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, we can derive an algebraic 
			equation for <m>r</m> that determines the general solution.
		</p>

		<assemblage><title> Key Takeaways </title>
			<ul>
				<li> Solutions to LHCC equations often take the form <m>e^{rx}</m>, where <m>r</m> is a constant. </li>
				<li> Exponential functions are useful because their derivatives preserve the same structure. </li>
				<li> By substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for <m>r</m>, 
					known as the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which determines the solution structure. </li>
			</ul>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			In the next section, we formalize this idea by deriving the characteristic equation, which allows us to 
			solve LHCC equations systematically.
		</p>

	<subsection><title> How Do Solutions Combine? </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we discovered that exponential functions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m> 
				often serve as solutions to LHCC equations. But what happens if we find multiple solutions? 
				How do they interact to form the general solution?
			</p>

			<p>
				Since LHCC equations are linear, they obey a fundamental principle: if <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> 
				are solutions to the equation, then their linear combination is also a solution. This property is 
				called the <term>principle of superposition</term>.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<theorem xml:id="superposition-theorem"><title> Principle of Superposition </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					If <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to an LHCC equation, then any linear combination of 
					these solutions, 
				</p>
				<me>
					y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2,
				</me>
				<p>
					is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>

		<example><title> Verifying Superposition </title>
			<p>
				Consider the second-order LHCC equation:
			</p>
			<men xml:id="lhcc-second-order-example">
				y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0.
			</men>

			<p>
				Suppose we have already determined that <m>y_1 = e^x</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{2x}</m> are solutions. 
				Show that their linear combination
			</p>

			<me>
				y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x}
			</me>

			<p>
				is also a solution for arbitrary constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Differentiating <m>y</m>:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow> y' = c_1 e^x + 2c_2 e^{2x} </mrow>
					<mrow> y'' = c_1 e^x + 4c_2 e^{2x} </mrow>
				</md>

				<p>
					Substituting into <xref ref="lhcc-second-order-example" />:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow> (c_1 e^x + 4c_2 e^{2x}) - 3(c_1 e^x + 2c_2 e^{2x}) + 2(c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x}) = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> c_1 e^x + 4c_2 e^{2x} - 3c_1 e^x - 6c_2 e^{2x} + 2c_1 e^x + 2c_2 e^{2x} = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> (c_1 e^x - 3c_1 e^x + 2c_1 e^x) + (4c_2 e^{2x} - 6c_2 e^{2x} + 2c_2 e^{2x}) = 0 </mrow>
					<mrow> 0 = 0. </mrow>
				</md>

				<p>
					Since the equation holds for all values of <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>, this confirms that 
					their linear combination is also a solution.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			The superposition principle allows us to construct the general solution to an LHCC equation by 
			summing solutions corresponding to each root of the characteristic equation. This means that for 
			an <m>n</m>-th order equation, we expect to find <m>n</m> linearly independent solutions, each 
			associated with a term in the general solution.
		</p>

		<assemblage><title> Key Takeaways </title>
			<ul>
				<li> If <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to an LHCC equation, then <m>c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2</m> 
					is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. </li>
				<li> The general solution to an LHCC equation consists of a linear combination of all its 
					independent solutions. </li>
				<li> The number of independent solutions corresponds to the order of the equation. </li>
			</ul>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Now that we understand how solutions combine, the next step is to derive the characteristic equation, 
			which allows us to determine these solutions systematically.
