	<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				To solve a differential equation effectively, we must first determine its structural properties. The term "LHCC" highlights three key characteristics: <term>linearity</term>, <term>homogeneity</term>, and <term>constant coefficients</term>. Understanding these properties is crucial because they dictate both the nature of the solutions and the methods used to obtain them.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we break down each component of an LHCC equation, providing clear definitions and illustrative examples. By the end, you will be equipped with the ability to classify differential equations based on these properties, distinguishing LHCC equations from other types.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC: Linearity </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall, a differential equation is considered <term>linear</term> if it only contains linear terms. In other words, the dependent variable and all its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied or composed with each other. In contrast, an equation is <term>nonlinear</term> if it contains terms such as <m>y^2</m>, <m>(y')^3</m>, <m>\sin(y)</m>, or <m>y \cdot y''</m>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The general form of an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation is:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{

				}}	+ \cdots +
				\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''

			<p>
				where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions of the independent variable <m>x</m>. <m>f(x)</m> is also commonly known as the <term>forcing function</term> or <term>nonhomogeneous term</term>.

				A linear differential equation is classified as <term>homogeneous</term> if its right-hand side (the constant term <m>f(x)</m>) is zero. Otherwise, it is classified as <term>nonhomogeneous</term>.
			</p>

				For example, the following equations are homogeneous
			</p>

			<me>
				x y'' - \cos x y' + 6y = 0, \qquad y''' + 2y'' = y'

			</p>

			<me>
				y'' + 4xy = \boxed{x}, \qquad y' + \boxed{e^x} = 0
			</me>
			
			<p>
				are nonhomogeneous because the (boxed) contant terms are not zero.

				A linear differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term> if all coefficient functions <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants rather than functions of <m>x</m>.

		<subsubsection><title> Summary: Recognizing LHCC Equations </title>
			
			<p>

			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="def-lhcc"><title>LHCC Equation</title>
				<statement>

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="lhcc-equation">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
				<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
				<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
				intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

	<subsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Now that we understand the structure of <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em>, our next goal is to determine their solutions. Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a predictable and systematic method for finding their solutions, making them particularly useful in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we will develop a structured approach to solving LHCC equations. First, we will examine why <em>exponential functions</em> naturally arise as solutions and why other function types do not. Next, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a powerful algebraic tool that allows us to extract the fundamental exponential solutions. Finally, we will use these solutions to construct the <em>general solution</em>, ensuring that we capture all possible solutions to the given differential equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the end of this subsection, you will have a <em>step-by-step framework</em> for solving LHCC equations of any order, laying the foundation for more advanced solution techniques in later sections.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> Fundamental Solution Types </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					When encountering a new type of differential equation, a natural question arises: <em>What kind of functions make sense to plug in for <m>y</m>?</em> The structure of the equation itself often provides clues as to which functions are likely to satisfy it. 
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<p>
				One way to identify suitable solutions is with the idea of <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom"><term>like terms</term></xref>. In algebra, like terms share the same variable parts and can be simplified as a single term when added. For example,
			</p>

			<men xml:id="like-terms-combining">
				\ul{5\cos x} + \ul{\ul{2x^2}} - \ul{\cos x} + \ul{\ul{3x^2}} = 4 \cos x + 5x^2
			</men>.
			
			<p>
				To see how this helps us find valid solutions, consider the LHCC equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y' - 2y = 0
			</me>.

			<p>
				A function of is a solution to this equation, if you plug it in for <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m> and everything simplifies to <m>0 = 0</m>. This only happens when all the terms on the left cancel out, meaning they simplify as <em>like terms</em> where the coefficients add up to zero.
			</p>

			<p>
				This implies that any function we plug in for <m>y</m>, must result in both <m>y'</m> and <m>2y</m> being like terms. Otherwise, the left side could never simplify to zero. This leads to the next important question:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>Which types of functions are like terms with their own differatives?</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is <em>another exponential function</em>. For example, the derivative of <m>e^{7x}</m> is <m>7e^{7x}</m>, which are like terms. This property makes exponentials good candidates for solutions to LHCC equations. To see this more concretely, let's substitute different function types into our equation and see what kind of terms they produce.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we can see, <em>only</em> the exponential function <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that fully cancel out. This provides strong evidence that exponentials are a natural choice for solutions to LHCC equations.
			</p>

			<p>
				To further solidify this idea, let's look at a second-order example:
			</p>

			<example xml:id="lhcc-soln-example-1"><title> Multiple Exponential Solutions </title>
			
				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>

						</p>
						<me>

						</me>,
						<p>
							but <m>y = x^4</m>, <m>y=\ln x</m> and <m>y=e^{3x}</m> are not.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						First, let's check the first two exponential functions:

			</example>

			<p>
				But what about other functions, such as sine and cosine? Interestingly, trigonometric functions also satisfy certain LHCC equations, but they are actually a <em>special case</em> of exponentials when complex numbers are involved. This will become clearer when we explore the <em>characteristic equation</em> in a later section.
			</p>

			<conclusion>
				<p>
					In this subsection, we discovered that exponential functions are the <em>fundamental solution types</em> for LHCC equations because they like terms with there own derivatives. This property allows them to fully cancel out, as required by the zero on the right side of the equation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now that we know what type of functions solve these equations, the next step is to determine <em>how to find them</em>. In the next section, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a powerful tool that allows us to extract the correct exponential solutions for any LHCC equation.
				</p>

		<subsubsection><title> The Characteristic Equation </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					So far, we have established that the best candidates for the solutions of <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em> are <em>exponential functions</em>, but we don't know which ones work and how many there are. To determine this, we need the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which we will cover in this subsection.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<p>
				To motivate the characteristic equation, let's start with the simple first-order LHCC equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y' - 5y = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				We assume the solution is an exponential, of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, where <m>r</m> is a constant to be determined. Substituting this into the equation, gives
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 e^{rx}	\amp = 0	</mrow>
				<mrow>	r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx}				\amp = 0	</mrow>
				<mrow>	(r - 5) e^{rx} 					\amp = 0	</mrow>
			</md>.

			<p>
				Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we must have: <m>\quad r - 5 = 0\ \Rightarrow\ r = 5</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Thus, the fundamental solution is <m>y = e^{5x}</m> and the equation <m>r - 5 = 0</m>, which determines <m>r</m>, is the <em>characteristic equation</em> for this LHCC equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's extend this idea to a higher-order equation. Consider the second-order equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				Again, assuming, <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, we substitute in <m>y</m>, <m>y'</m>, and <m>y''</m> to obtain
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	(r^2 e^{rx}) - 3 (r e^{rx}) - 4 (e^{rx})	\amp = 0	</mrow>
				<mrow>	(r^2 - 3r - 4) e^{rx}						\amp = 0	</mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				As before, this leads to the <em>characteristic equation</em>, given by
			</p>

			<me>
				r^2 - 3r - 4 = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				Solving for <m>r</m>, we get
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> (r - 4)(r + 1) = 0 \amp </mrow>
				<mrow> r = 4, \quad r = -1. \amp </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				and finally the fundamental solutions are
			</p>

			<me>
				y_1 = e^{4x}, \quad y_2 = e^{-x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				As you can see, the structure of exponential functions naturally lead to a characteristic equation that we can solve to determine each exponential solution. The formal definition of the characteristic equation is given next.
			</p>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					We are now ready to discuss how to form the general solution to a Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equation. Before we do, let's review everything we know about LHCC equations up to this point.

				<p>
					Now, we will explore how to combine these fundamental solutions to construct the <em>general solution</em> to any LHCC equation. This will allow us to capture all possible solutions to the differential equation, ensuring that we do not miss any.
				</p>

			</introduction>

			<p>
				In addition to these facts, the last thing that we need to start building the general solution is an important concept known as the <em>superposition principle</em>.

					<p>
						is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m>.

			<p>

			<conclusion>
				<p>
					These examples illustrate how the general solution of an LHCC equation is created given the exponential functions that satisfy the equation. While the method is fairly straight forward, there are still a few details that need to be addressed. In particular, we will investigate what to do if the characteristic equations has <em>repeated roots</em> and how to handle high order LHCC equations.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				In this subsection, we developed a complete framework for solving <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em>. We began by exploring why <em>exponential functions</em> serve as the fundamental solutions to these equations, using the concept of <em>like terms</em> to justify their role. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We then introduced the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into solving a polynomial equation. This method allows us to systematically determine the correct set of fundamental solutions for any LHCC equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we constructed the <em>general solution</em>, showing that the number of fundamental solutions always matches the order of the equation. Using the <em>superposition principle</em>, we combined these solutions into a single expression that captures all possible solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				The key takeaways from this subsection are:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> <em>Exponential functions</em> naturally emerge as solutions to LHCC equations due to their unique differentiation properties.</li>
				<li> The <em>characteristic equation</em> provides a systematic way to determine the fundamental solutions.</li>
				<li> The <em>general solution</em> consists of all independent exponential solutions, each multiplied by an arbitrary constant.</li>
				<li> The number of solutions matches the <em>order</em> of the differential equation.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				With this foundation, we are now prepared to explore more advanced solution methods, including cases where the characteristic equation has <em>repeated or complex roots</em>, which introduce new types of solutions.

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			In this section, we have established the foundation for understanding <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</em> differential equations. We began by identifying their key structural components‚Äî<em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>‚Äîwhich define their form and behavior.
		</p>

		<p>
			From there, we explored how these properties influence the types of solutions LHCC equations can have. The most important insight is that exponential functions naturally emerge as solutions due to their unique differentiation properties. This allows us to reduce complex differential equations to algebraic ones, paving the way for systematic solution methods.
		</p>

		<p>
			With this understanding in place, we are now ready to develop practical techniques for solving LHCC equations. In the next section, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a powerful tool that enables us to find solutions efficiently. By applying this method, we will unlock a general approach for solving LHCC equations of any order.
