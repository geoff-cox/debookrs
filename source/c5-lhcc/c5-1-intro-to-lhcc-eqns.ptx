			Before we fully define and analyze these equations, it is important to explore their fundamental building blocks: <term>linear (L)</term>, <term>homogeneous (H)</term>, and <term>constant coefficients (CC)</term>. These three properties determine the structure of LHCC equations and the types of solutions you will get from these equations.

	<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Before diving into the methods for solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations), we first need to understand what these equations look like and how to recognize them. The term "LHCC" captures three essential characteristics: <em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>. Let's break these down one by one.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall, a differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if it can be written as 
				<me>
					\text{Sum of Linear Terms } = \text{ Constant Term}
				</me>
				where a term is linear if it contains, at most, a single dependent variable raised to power of one and not inside another function. The constant term is the collection of all terms that do not contain a dependent variable. 
			</p>

			<p>
				So, every <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation can be organized as follows:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{ 
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_n(x)}	}}\ y^{(n)}
				}}	+ \cdots +
				\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y'			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_1(x)}	}}\ y'
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_0(x)}	}}\ y
				}}	=
				\us{	\large\text{term}			}{ 
				\us{	\large\text{constant }		}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{f(x)}	}}
				}}
			</men>

			<p>
				where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Examples of <m>\quad</m> 
				<xref ref="linear-equation-examples" text="custom">		üëâ Linear Equations		</xref> <m>\quad</m> 
				<xref ref="nonlinear-equation-examples" text="custom">	üëâ Nonlinear Equations	</xref>
			</p>

			
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>CC</q> in LHCC </title>

			<p>
				A linear differential equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term> if all of the coefficients in the equation are constant (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>). 
				<aside>
					<p>
						‚òùÔ∏è <term>Remember!</term> Constant terms are not coefficients.
					</p>
				</aside>
				This condition results in dropping <q><m>(x)</m></q> on each coefficient in equation <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				So, every linear differential equation with constant coefficients has the form
			</p>

			<men xml:id="constant-coefficient-de">
				a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x),
			</men>

			<p>
				where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants. Here are some examples of linear differential equations with constant coefficients:
			</p>

			<me>
				2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
			</me>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>H</q> in LHCC </title>

			<p>
				To state that a linear differential equation is <term>homogeneous</term> is to say that the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, is zero. When the constant is nonzero (i.e., <m>f(x) \neq 0</m>), we say the equation is <term>nonhomogeneous</term>. Therefore, setting <m>f(x) = 0</m> in <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/> leads to the form for any linear homogeneous differential equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="homogeneous-de">
				a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0.
			</men>

			<p>
				This condition implies that every term in the equation must involve the dependent variable <m>y</m> or one of its derivatives. 
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> LHCC Equations </title>
			
			<p>
				Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="def-lhcc"><title>LHCC Equation</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
					</p>
					<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
						a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
					</men>
					<p>
						where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
			
			<p>
				Since LHCC equations are the types of equations that our next method will solve, let's make sure we can identify these equations with an example.
			</p>
			
		</subsubsection>

		<example>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s
					</me>
					<p>
						Determine which of the following equations have constant coefficients.
					</p>
					<me>
						3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad
						\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad
						s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
					</me>
					<p>
						For each of the following differential equations, identify the coefficients and state whether they are constants or functions of the independent variable:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li> <m>y'' + 4y' + 6y = 0</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>x^2 y'' + xy' + y = \ln(x)</m>, </li>
						<li> <m>u'' + 2xu' + u = 5x</m>. </li>
					</ol>
				</statement>
			</p>
			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>
						3y'' - 2ty' + y = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}, \quad
						\frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{BurntOrange} -3x^2}, \quad
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}
						</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.
					</p>
				</solution>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Check if each coefficient is constant:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{3}}} y'' -
							\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{2\tau}}}\ y' +
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} y = \tau, \quad

							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{1}{2}}}} P^2 = 1, \quad
							\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} s''' =
							\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}} s
						</me>.
						The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="lhcc-equation">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
				<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
				<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
				intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

			<p>
				Now that we have established the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, the next step is to explore the kinds of functions that satisfy these equations. While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit surprisingly limited set of possible solutions. The nature of these solutions are highlighted in the properties that follow.

		<subsubsection><title> What Do Solutions Look Like? </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The next task is to take a closer look at the <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">LHCC Property 1</xref>. In this discussion, we will use our knowledge of calculus and algebra to logically justify why exponential functions naturally satisfy these types of equations. 
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<p>
				A useful way to understand what types of solutions to expect is with the concept of <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom"><term>like terms</term></xref>. In algebra, when you add two like terms together they can be simplified by adding their coefficients. Like terms are also the only terms that can <q>cancel out</q> through addition or subtraction. <m>^üìå</m>
				<aside>
					<p>
						<term>üìå Note:</term> We are using <q>like terms</q> to represent the more advanced notion of linearly dependence of functions.
					</p>
				</aside>
			</p>

			<p>
				Using this perspective, let's consider the following simple LHCC equation,
			</p>

			<me>
				y' - 2y = 0
			</me>.

			<p>
				To be a solution, we would expect any function that we plug in for <m>y</m> to result in <m>0 = 0</m>. That is, after plugging in a function of <m>x</m> for each <m>y</m> all the terms must cancel out, simplifying the left side to zero. The only types of terms that do this are <q>like terms</q>! So, looking back at our equation, we see that <m>y'</m> and <m>2y</m> must give us like terms after plugging in a function. But, what kind of function is a like term with its own derivative?
			</p>

			<p>
				You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is always another exponential function, so perhaps we are on to something. To convince ourselves, let's plug in a few different functions for <m>y</m> and see if we get any like terms.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you can see, only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that simplify to zero. This is why exponential functions often work well in LHCC equations. Let's now examine a more complex example to build upon this idea.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="lhcc-soln-example-1"><title> Give Us a Title Prick </title>

				<p>
					Our goal was to examine <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">LHCC Property 1</xref> and these examples are evidence that exponential functions have a perfect structure as solutions to these types of equations. 
				</p>

				<theorem><title> What about <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> as solutions? </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						If you are wondering why we didn't include <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> in the list of possible <q>like term</q> solutions, then you have a good grasp of this material. Indeed, the fact that derivatives of <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> cycle back to themselves with every second derivative, indicates that they can also produce like terms, which combine when plugged into certain differential equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						The reason we didn't include them is because exponentials actually encompass <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> as special cases when <m>r</m> in <m>e^{rx}</m> is a complex number. In particular, if <m>r</m> can be expressed as <m>r = ib</m>, then <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="custom">Euler's formula</xref> tells us that
					</p> 

					<me>
						e^{rx} = e^{ibx} = \cos (bx) + i \sin (bx)

						Therefore, the <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> cases are also covered by the <m>e^{rx}</m> case.

			<introduction>

				<p>
					The previous section showed us that exponential functions naturally satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations. Moreover, we saw in example <xref ref="lhcc-soln-example-1"/> that one LHCC equation can have multiple exponential solutions (e.g. <m>e^{4x}</m> and <m>e^{-x}</m>).	The same example showed that not every exponential function is necesaarily a solution (e.g. <m>e^{3x}</m>). In this section, we discuss how many exponential solutions you can expect and how to combine them to form the general solution.

			<paragraphs><title> The Principle of Superposition </title>

				<p>
					A key property of linear differential equations is the <term>principle of superposition</term>. This principle states that if <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to a linear homogeneous equation, then so is <m>c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2</m>, for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. This property allows us to construct the general solution to an LHCC equation by combining

					y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x}
				</me>

				<p>
					is also a valid solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. We verify this by substituting <m>y</m> into the equation

					The superposition principle allows us to construct the general solution to an LHCC equation by 
					summing solutions corresponding to each root of the characteristic equation. This means that for 
					an <m>n</m>-th order equation, we expect to find <m>n</m> linearly independent solutions, each 
					associated with a term in the general solution.

				<p>
					Since the two solutions <m>y_1 = e^{2x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{3x}</m> are independent, their linear combination 
					represents the most general solution to the equation. We express this as:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x},
				</me>

				<p>
					where <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> are arbitrary constants. The number of independent solutions corresponds to the 
					order of the differential equation. For a second-order equation, we expect two independent solutions, leading to 
					a two-parameter general solution.

					Now that we understand why solutions combine, the next step is to formalize the characteristic equation, which provides 
					a systematic way to determine all possible solutions.

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li> If <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to an LHCC equation, then <m>c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2</m> 
							is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. </li>
						<li> The general solution to an LHCC equation consists of a linear combination of all its 
							independent solutions. </li>
						<li> The number of independent solutions corresponds to the order of the equation. </li>
						<li> An LHCC equation often has multiple exponential solutions, determined by solving the characteristic equation. </li>
						<li> The principle of superposition states that any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. </li>
						<li> The general solution is formed by summing all independent exponential solutions with arbitrary coefficients. </li>
						<li> The solutions to LHCC equations are exponential functions because their derivatives preserve the same functional form. </li>
						<li> The concept of <q>like terms</q> helps explain why other function types (polynomials, trigonometric functions) do not work. </li>
						<li> By substituting an exponential <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for <m>r</m>, which determines the general solution. </li>
