<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Introduction to LHCC Equations </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Before learning the methods that solve Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) differential equations, it is important to be able to identify these equation and have some intuition about the type of solutions that satisfy them.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we will develop the fundamentals of LHCC equations, starting with a break down of their key structural components‚Äî<em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>. From there, we will examine why <em>exponential functions</em> naturally arise as solutions and why other function types do not. Finally, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a powerful algebraic tool that allows us to extract the specific exponential solutions that satisfy these equations.

	<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				To solve a differential equation effectively, we must first determine its structural properties. The term "LHCC" highlights three key characteristics: <term>linearity</term>, <term>homogeneity</term>, and <term>constant coefficients</term>. Understanding these properties is crucial because they dictate both the nature of the solutions and the methods used to obtain them.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we break down each component of an LHCC equation, providing clear definitions and illustrative examples. By the end, you will be equipped with the ability to classify differential equations based on these properties, distinguishing LHCC equations from other types.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC: Linearity </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall, a differential equation is considered <term>linear</term> if it only contains linear terms. In other words, the dependent variable and all its derivatives appear only to the first power and are not multiplied or composed with each other. In contrast, an equation is <term>nonlinear</term> if it contains terms such as <m>y^2</m>, <m>(y')^3</m>, <m>\sin(y)</m>, or <m>y \cdot y''</m>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The general form of an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation is:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{ 
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_n(x)}	}}\ y^{(n)}
				}}	+ \cdots +
				\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y'			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_1(x)}	}}\ y'
				}}	+
				\us{	\large\text{of } y			}{
				\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_0(x)}	}}\ y
				}}	=
				\us{	\large\text{term}			}{ 
				\us{	\large\text{constant }		}{
						\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{f(x)}	}}
				}}
			</men>

			<p>
				where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions of the independent variable <m>x</m>. <m>f(x)</m> is also commonly known as the <term>forcing function</term> or <term>nonhomogeneous term</term>.

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>H</q> in LHCC: Homogeneous </title>

			<p>
				A linear differential equation is classified as <term>homogeneous</term> if its right-hand side (the constant term <m>f(x)</m>) is zero. Otherwise, it is classified as <term>nonhomogeneous</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the following equations are homogeneous
			</p>

			<me>
				x y'' - \cos x y' + 6y = 0, \qquad y''' + 2y'' = y'
			</me>

			<p>
				since the constant terms are zero in each case. The equations
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' + 4xy = \boxed{x}, \qquad y' + \boxed{e^x} = 0
			</me>
			
			<p>
				are nonhomogeneous because the (boxed) contant terms are not zero.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The <q>CC</q> in LHCC: Constant Coefficients </title>
			
			<aside>
				<p>
					‚òùÔ∏è <term>Remember!</term> Constant terms are not coefficients.
				</p>
			</aside>

			<p>
				A linear differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term> if all coefficient functions <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants rather than functions of <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Some linear differential equations with constant coefficients are
			</p>

			<me>
				2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
			</me>,

			<p>
				and here are some equations with (boxed) non-constant coefficients:
			</p>

			<me>
				\boxed{3^x}\ y'' + \boxed{2x}\ y' + y = 0, \qquad y'' + y' + \boxed{\ln x}\ y = \sin x
			</me>.

		</subsubsection>
			
		<p>
			Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
		</p>
		
		<definition xml:id="def-lhcc"><title> LHCC Equation </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
				</p>
				<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
				</men>
				<p>
					where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
		
		<p>
			The following equations are examples of LHCC equations:
		</p>

		<me>
			2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = 0 \qquad u'' = u
		</me>.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
				intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

	<subsection><title> LHCC Solution Components </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Now that we can recognize an LHCC equation, we want to use this information to gain insight into their solutions. In this section, you will see why the properties of exponential functions make them a <q>perfect fit</q> for these equations.
			</p>

			<note><title> In this discussion, homogenous equations will have a <m>y</m> term </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						For this discussion, we will assume that homogeneous equations contain a <m>y</m> term. For if they didn't, then you could integrate both sides leaving you with a nonhomogeneous equation.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</note>
		</introduction>

		<p>
			Simply speaking, an <xref ref="lhcc-equation" text="custom">LHCC equation</xref> is just the sum or difference of functions that equal zero. For example, here is a first-order LHCC equation
		</p>

		<me>
			y' - 2y = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			Whatever the <q>solution</q> is, we must get <m>0 = 0</m> when we plug it in. That is,
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>	(\text{solution})' - 2(\text{solution}) \amp = 0	</mrow>
			<mrow>	\text{derivative terms} - 2(\text{solution}) \amp = 0	</mrow>
		</md>
		
		<p>
			In order to get <m>0 = 0</m> from this last equation, all the terms on the left must cancel out. However, the only terms that cancel are <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom"><term>like-terms</term></xref>. Meaning, the solution and the derivative terms must all be like-terms! This leads to the key question:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<q>Which types of functions are like-terms with their own derivatives?</q>
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is <em>another exponential function</em>. For example, the derivative of <m>e^{7x}</m> is <m>7e^{7x}</m>, which are like-terms. This property is unique to exponentials and is exactly what makes them <q>perfect</q> solutions for LHCC equations. To see this, let's substitute different functions into this equation to see what kind of terms they produce.
		</p>

				<em>Case 1:</em> <m>\quad y = x^2</m>

					<mrow> \us{\large\text{no cancellation}}{\ub{2x - 2x^2}_{\large\text{non like-terms,}}} = 0\amp </mrow>

			<p>

				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			As you can see, only the exponential function produced like-terms after being plugged into the equation. The next example shows the same holds true for a second-order equation.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				These examples provide strong evidence that exponentials are a natural choice for solutions to LHCC equations. Moreover, the last example shows that not all exponential functions work, only those where the coefficients sum to zero. In the next section, we will introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, a tool that tells us exactly which of the exponential functions work for a given equation.

			<theorem><title> What about other functions, like sine and cosine? </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Interestingly, sine and cosine also satisfy certain LHCC equations, but they are actually a <em>special case</em> of exponentials when complex numbers are involved. This will become clearer when we explore the <em>characteristic equation</em> in a later section.

	<subsection><title> The Characteristic Equation &amp; Fundamental Solutions </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				So far, we have established that the best candidates for the solutions of <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em> are <em>exponential functions</em>, but we don't know which ones work and how many there are. To determine this, we need the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which we will cover in this subsection.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<p>
			To motivate the characteristic equation, let's start with the simple first-order LHCC equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			y' - 5y = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			To get the correct exponential function, we start by substituting the generic exponential, <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, into the equation, giving us
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 e^{rx}	\amp = 0	</mrow>
		</md>.

		<p>
			Taking the derivative and factoring out the exponential we are left with
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>	r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx}				\amp = 0	</mrow>
			<mrow>	(r - 5) e^{rx} 					\amp = 0	</mrow>
		</md>.

		<p>
			Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we have
		</p>

		<me>
			r - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5.
		</me>

		<p>
			Thus, <m>y = e^{5x}</m> is a solution and the equation where it came from, <m>r - 5 = 0</m>, is known as the <em>characteristic equation</em> for this LHCC equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, let's try the sam approach with the second-order equation
		</p>

		<me>
			y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			Again, substitute <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into <m>y</m>, <m>y'</m>, and <m>y''</m> to obtain
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>	(r^2 e^{rx}) - 3 (r e^{rx}) - 4 (e^{rx})	\amp = 0	</mrow>
			<mrow>	(r^2 - 3r - 4) e^{rx}						\amp = 0	</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, this leads to the <em>characteristic equation</em>,
		</p>

		<me>
			r^2 - 3r - 4 = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			that we solve for <m>r</m> like so
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> (r - 4)(r + 1) = 0 \amp </mrow>
			<mrow> r = 4, \quad r = -1. \amp </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			and finally, we get the solutions:
		</p>

		<me>
			y_1 = e^{4x}, \quad y_2 = e^{-x}.
		</me>

		<p>
			In general, when you plug <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, you will always end up with a polynomial equation that you can use to find all the <m>r</m>-values that make <m>e^{rx}</m> a solution to the differential equation. This polynomial equation is called the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which we formally defined as follows.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-characteristic-equation"><title> The Characteristic Equation </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					The <term>characteristic equation</term> of an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation

				</p>

				<me>
					y_1=e^{r_1 x},\quad y_2=e^{r_2 x},\quad \dots,\quad y_n=e^{r_n x}
				</me>

				<p>
					where <m>r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n</m> are the <m>n</m> solutions to the characteristic equation.
				</p>

				<theorem><title> Repeated <m>r</m>-values modify the Fundamental Solution </title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Later, we will see that if <m>r</m>-values repeat in the characteristic equation, the fundamental solutions corresponding to these <m>r</m>-values must be modified by a factor of <m>x</m> for each repeat. For example, if <m>r = 5</m> appears three times as a characteristic equation solution, the fundamental solutions corresponding to these three <m>r</m>-values,
							<me>
								y_1 = e^{5x}, \quad y_2 = e^{5x}, \quad y_3 = e^{5x}
							</me>,
							are replaced with
							<me>
								y_1 = e^{5x}, \quad y_2 = x^1 e^{5x}, \quad y_3 = x^2 e^{5x}.

			This last example demostrates that, in general, an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation has <m>n</m> exponential solutions of the form <m>e^{rx}</m>, where <m>r</m> is a solution (real or complex) to the <m>n</m>-th degree characteristic equation.
		</p>

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				Now that we understand how to systematically find the fundamental exponential solutions, the last and easiest step is to construct the <em>general solution</em> by combining these solutions appropriately.
