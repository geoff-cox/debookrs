	<exercise xml:id="lhcc-exercise-01">
		<statement>
			<p>
				Find any <m>r</m> values that make <m>y = e^{rx}</m> a solution to the LHCC equation
				<men xml:id="lhcc-exercise-01-eqn-01">
					y'' - 9y = 0.
				</men>
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Approach this as if you were verifying that <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is a solution to <xref ref="lhcc-exercise-01-eqn-01"/>. So, plug it into the equation and check if left and right-hand sides are equal.
			</p>

			<p>
				Since we need <m>y^{\prime\prime}</m>, let's compute this first.
			</p>
			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds y' = e^{rx} \cdot (r) = re^{rx}</m></cell>
					<cell><em>(chain rule)</em></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds y'' = [re^{rx}]^{\prime} = r[e^{rx}]^{\prime}  = r(e^{rx} \cdot (r)) = r^2e^{rx}</m></cell>
					<cell><em>(chain rule)</em></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
			<p>
				Plugging <m>y^{\prime\prime}</m> and <m>y</m> into the left side of <xref ref="lhcc-exercise-01-eqn-01"/> gives
			</p>
			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds r^2e^{rx} - 9e^{rx} = 0 </m></cell>
					<cell/>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds (r^2 - 9)\ e^{rx} = 0</m></cell>
					<cell><em>(factor out <m>e^{rx}</m>)</em></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
			<p>
				Now, <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is only a solution if we can show LHS = RHS (<em><m>0 = 0</m> in this case</em>). It should be clear that this depends on the values of <m>r</m>. This is just an algebra problem where we must solve for <m>r</m>.
			</p>
			<tabular>
				<row>
					<cell><m>\ds r^2 - 9 = 0,</m></cell>
					<cell><m>\ds e^{rx} = 0</m></cell>
					<cell><em>(set each factor to 0)</em></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
					<cell><m>r = \pm 3,</m></cell>
					<cell>
						<em>no solution</em>
						<fn>
							Attempting to solve <m>\ds e^{rx} = 0</m> for <m>r</m> by applying <m>\ln</m> would give
							<me>
								\ds \ln(e^{rx}) = \ln(0) \, \leftarrow \text{not defined}
							</me>
						</fn>
					</cell>
					<cell/>
				</row>
			</tabular>
			<p>
				So, the only <m>r</m> values that make the LHS = RHS is <m>r = -3, 3</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>

	<exercise>
		<p>
			Consider another exercise, a fourth-order LHCC equation:
			<me>  y^{(4)} - 5y'' + 4y = 0 </me>.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				The characteristic equation is:
				<md>
					<mrow> r^4 - 5r^2 + 4 = 0 </mrow>
				</md>.
				Let <m>u = r^2</m>, then we can rewrite the equation as:
				<md>
					<mrow> u^2 - 5u + 4 = 0 </mrow>
				</md>.
				Solving for <m>u</m>, we get:
				<md>
					<mrow> u = 1, \quad u = 4 </mrow>
				</md>.
				Thus, <m>r^2 = 1</m> gives <m>r = \pm 1</m>, and <m>r^2 = 4</m> gives <m>r = \pm 2</m>. The general solution is:
				<me> y = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{-x} + c_3 e^{2x} + c_4 e^{-2x} </me>.
