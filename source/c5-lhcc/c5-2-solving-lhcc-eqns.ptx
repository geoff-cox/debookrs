<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Solving LHCC Equations </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Now that we understand the structure and solutions associated with <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em>, our final goal is to develop systematic ways to obtain their general solutions. Fortunately, LHCC solutions consist exclusively of exponential function types. By understanding the role of <em>exponential functions</em> in these equations, we can construct the general solution by combining the fundamental solutions that satisfy the equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we will show how <em>general solutions</em> to LHCC equaions are built by employing the <em>superposition principle</em>. Additionally, we will investigate how the nature of the solutions to the <em>characteristic equation</em> affects the final form of the general solution.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> The General Solution </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				We are now ready to discuss how to form the general solution to a Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equation. Before we do, let's list out everything we know about LHCC equations so far.
			</p>

			<sidebyside widths="14% 86%">
				<p>
					✏️ <term>FACT 1</term>
				</p>
				<p>
					An <m>n</m>-th order of LHCC equation has the form
					<me>
						a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
					</me>,
					where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<sidebyside widths="14% 86%">
				<p>
					✏️ <term>FACT 2</term>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>characteristic equation</em> of the LHCC equation is given by
					<me>
						a_n\ r^n + a_{n-1}\ r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 + a_1\ r + a_0 = 0
					</me>,
					and has <m>n</m> solutions: <m>\ r_1,\ r_2,\ \dots,\ r_n</m> (real or complex).
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<sidebyside widths="14% 86%">
				<p>
					✏️ <term>FACT 3</term>
				</p>
				<p>
					The <em>fundamental solutions</em> to the LHCC equation are given by
					<me>
						y_1 = e^{r_1 x},\quad y_2 = e^{r_2 x},\quad \dots,\quad y_n = e^{r_n x},
					</me>
					where <m>r_1,\ r_2,\ \dots,\ r_n</m> are the solutions to the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Now, we will explore how to combine these fundamental solutions to construct the <em>general solution</em> to any LHCC equation. This will allow us to capture all possible solutions to the differential equation, ensuring that we do not miss any.
			</p>

		</introduction>

		<p>
			In addition to these facts, the last thing that we need to start building the general solution is an important concept known as the <em>superposition principle</em>. 
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="superposition-principle"><title> Superposition Principle </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					If <m>y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n</m> are solutions to a homogeneous linear differential equation, then any combination:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = c_1\ y_1 + c_2\ y_2 + \dots + c_n\ y_n
				</me>

				<p>
					is also a solution for any constants <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			With this result and the above facts in hand, we can now construct the general solution to any LHCC equation as the sum of all its fundamental solutions. This gives us our fourth and final fact:
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="14% 86%">
			<p>
				✏️ <term>FACT 4</term>
			</p>
			<p>
				For an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation, the general solution is
				<me>
					y = c_1\ y_1 + c_2\ y_2 + \cdots + c_n\ y_n,
				</me>
				where <m>c_1</m>, <m>c_2</m>, <m>\dots</m>, <m>c_n</m> are arbitrary constants and <m>y_1</m>, <m>y_2</m>, <m>\dots</m>, <m>y_n</m> are the fundamental solutions.
			</p>

		<p>
			Now, let's put this into practice with some concrete examples.

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				These examples illustrate how the general solution of an LHCC equation is created given the exponential functions that satisfy the equation. While the method is fairly straight forward, there are still a few details that need to be addressed. In particular, we will investigate what to do if the characteristic equations has <em>repeated solutions</em> and how to handle high order LHCC equations.

	<subsection><title> Second-Order Equations </title>
					
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The most important class of linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations are the second-order equations. This is because nearly every idea you learn for this order, extends to any higher-order case. For this discussion, we will explore the general solution to second-order LHCC equations and the different cases that arise based on the nature of the characteristic solutions. 
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> Real, Repeated &amp; Complex Cases  </title>
			
			<p>
				A <em>second-order LHCC equation</em> has the form:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-de00">
				a y'' + b y' + c y = 0
			</men>

			<p>
				where <m>a, b, c</m> are constants. To solve such equations, we assume solutions of the form, <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, and determine the values of <m>r</m> that satisfy the equation. This leads to the <em>characteristic equation</em>:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-characteristic-equation00">
				a r^2 + b r + c = 0
			</men>

			<p>
				Since this is a quadratic equation, we can solve it using the quadratic formula:
			</p>

			<me>
				r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
			</me>

			<p>
				If you need a refresher on quadratic equations, take a minute to review it <xref ref="solving-the-quadratic-equation" text="custom">HERE</xref>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Depending on the value of the <em>discriminant</em>, <m>\Delta = b^2 - 4ac</m>, we classify solutions into three distinct cases:
			</p>

			<paragraphs xml:id="lhcc-case-100"><title> Case 1 </title>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta &gt; 0</m> (positive), the characteristic equation has two distinct real solutions (i.e., <m>r_1 \ne r_2</m>):
				</p>

				<me>
					r_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \quad
					r_2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
				</me>

				<p>
					In this case, the general solution is a simple sum of exponentials:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="lhcc-order-2-case-1-general-solution">
					y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x}
				</men>
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="lhcc-case-200"><title> Case 2 </title>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta = 0</m>, then the characteristic equation has a <em>single repeated solution</em>:
				</p>

				<me>
					r_1 = r_2 = \frac{-b}{2a}
				</me>

				<p>
					At first, it may seem that the general solution should simply be:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_1 x}
				</me>

				<p>
					However, these two terms are <em>like terms</em> and collapse into a single exponential. This would leads to an incomplete general solution. To ensure two independent exponential solutions, we replace the second term with <m>x e^{r_1 x}</m>, giving us two non-like terms that are independent:
				</p>

				<men>
					y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 x e^{r_1 x}
				</men>

				<p>
					This modification by <m>x</m> not only ensures that the two solutions cannot be combined as like-terms, but it also retains the properties that make it a valid solution in the first place. 
				</p>

			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="lhcc-case-300"><title> Case 3 </title>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta &lt; 0</m> (negative), the characteristic equation has <em>complex solutions</em>:
				</p>

				<me>
					r_1 = \alpha + i \beta, \quad r_2 = \alpha - i \beta
				</me>

				<p>
					and the fundamental solutions are:
				</p>

				<me>
					y_1 = e^{(\alpha + i \beta)x}, \quad y_2 = e^{(\alpha - i \beta)x}
				</me>

				<p>
					It is customary to express these in terms of <em>sine and cosine</em> (via <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="title"/>):
				</p>

				<men>
					y = e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x))
				</men>

			</paragraphs>

			<p>
				The three cases are summarized below.
			</p>

			<assemblage><title> Summary of Cases </title>
				<p>
					Let <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> be the solutions of the characteristic equation associated with the second-order LHCC equation. The general solution is:
					<dl width="wide">
						<li xml:id="lhcc-case-1"><title> Case 1 (real &amp; <m>\ne</m>) </title>
							<m>
								\ds y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x} \quad (r_1 \ne r_2)
							</m>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="lhcc-case-2"><title> Case 2 (real &amp; <m>=</m>) </title>
							<m>
								\ds y = (c_1 + c_2 x) e^{r_1 x} \quad (r_1 = r_2)
							</m>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="lhcc-case-3"><title> Case 3 (complex) </title>
							<line>
								<m>
									\ds y = e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x))

								</m>
							</line>
						</li>
					</dl>
				</p>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				Now that we have established these three cases, let's practice solving some second-order LHCC equations.

	<subsection><title> Higher-Order Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Solving <em>higher-order</em> Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations follows the same fundamental approach as second-order equations: we assume exponential solutions and solve the <em>characteristic equation</em> to determine the exponents. However, as the <em>order increases</em>, the characteristic equation becomes a <em>higher-degree polynomial</em>, which can introduce additional challenges.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> Real, Repeated, Complex &amp; Mixed Cases  </title>
			
			<p>
				We know the <m>n</m><em>-th order LHCC equation</em>,
			</p>

			<me>
				a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0
			</me>,

			<p>
				has the <em>characteristic equation</em>
			</p>

			<me>
				a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0
			</me>.

			<p>
				An <m>n</m>-th order polynomial equation has <m>n</m> <em>solutions</em>, and each solution, <m>r</m> determines a <em>fundamental solution</em> in one of the following forms:
			</p>

			<p>
				<sidebyside widths="28% 24% 48%" valign="middle">
					<p>
						<me>\ul{c\, e^{r x}}</me>
					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\ul{c\, x^{k} e^{r x}}</me>

					<p>
						<me>\ul{e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x))}</me>

					</p>
					<p>
						<me>\os{\uparrow}{\qquad r \text{ complex, } r=\alpha \pm i\beta \qquad} </me>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
			</p>

			<p>
				The form each term takes in the general solution uses the same strategy as in the second-order case, with one additional case to account for <em>mixed</em> solutions. A brief discussion of the four cases is broken down as follows.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> Case 1: Real &amp; Distinct </title>
				<p>
					For each <em>real</em>, <m>r</m>, that has no <em>repeats</em>, the term corresponding to this <m>r</m> would be represented in the general solution by
				</p>

				<me>
					y = \textcolor{NavyBlue}{c_1 e^{\large r x}\!} + 
					\left(
					\begin{array}{c}
						\text{other general}\\
						\text{solution terms}
					\end{array}
					\right)
				</me>.
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> Case 2: Real &amp; Repeated </title>
				<p>
					For each <em>real</em>, <m>r</m>, that <em>repeats <m>k</m> times</em>, the <m>k</m> terms corresponding to this <m>r</m> would be represented in the general solution by
				</p>

				<me>
					y = \textcolor{NavyBlue}{\ub{c_1 e^{\large r x} + c_2 x e^{\large r x} + \ldots + c_k x^{k-1} e^{\large r x}\!}_{\large k \text{ terms from } r}} + 
					\left(
					\begin{array}{c}
						\text{other general}\\
						\text{solution terms}
					\end{array}
					\right)
				</me>,

				<p>
					where <m>k</m> is called the <em>multiplicity</em> of <m>r</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					It is possible to have multiple repeated solutions, leading to additional modified terms based on the number of repeats, like this one.
				</p>
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> Case 3: Complex </title>
				<p>
					For each <em>complex</em>, <m>r</m>, with the <em>conjugate pair</em>,
				</p>

				<me>
					r = \alpha + i\beta, \quad r = \alpha - i\beta
				</me>,

				<p>
					the terms corresponding to this <m>r</m> will appear in the general solution as:
				</p>

				<me>
					y = \textcolor{NavyBlue}{\ub{e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x))\!}_{\large 2 \text{ terms from } r}} + 
					\left(
					\begin{array}{c}
						\text{other general}\\
						\text{solution terms}
					\end{array}
					\right)
				</me>.

				<p>
					It is possible to have multiple complex solutions, leading to additional sine and cosine terms, like this one.
				</p>
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> Case 4: Mixed Types </title>
				<p>
					Since high degree polynomials can have a mix of real, repeated, and complex solutions, the general solution may include a mixture of the terms above. For each solution of the characteristic equation, follow the guidelines above to determine what terms to include in the general solution.
				</p>
			</paragraphs>

				As <xref ref="lhcc-roots-to-general-solution"/> demonstrates, constructing the general solution of an LHCC equation is straightforward once you have the solutions of the characteristic equation. However, finding the solutions to <em>high-degree polynomial equations</em> can be a challenge. There are some strategies for doing this by hand, but sometimes we the help of computational tools to find them. Some of these methods are outlined below.

				<p>
					There are some forms of high-degree polynomials that can be factored fairly easily using techniques like <em>common factoring</em>, <em>difference of squares</em> or <em>grouping</em>. For example,

					Whenever possible, factoring methods should be used since they tend to lead to exact solutions in very little time.

			<paragraphs><title> Rational Root Theorem </title>
				<p>
					The <em>Rational Root Theorem</em> helps identify possible rational solutions by considering factors of the constant and leading coefficients. If a rational solution is found, polynomial division can reduce the equation to a lower-degree polynomial. While this method is powerful and can handle many problems, it is often quite tedius and its multi-step process makes it prone to human error.

				<p>
					When facing a high-order charateristic equation that cannot be factored, a good strategy is to utilize technology to solve these tyes of problems. Many software tools are available and you are encouraged to use any that you are familiar with.

								First, write down the characteristic equation:
								<md>
									<mrow> r^3 - 6r^2 + 11r - 6 = 0 </mrow>
								</md>.
								Plugging this into to the factoring tool shows that it factors as <m> (r-3)(r-2)(r-1) </m>.	Solving for <m>r</m>, we get
								<md>
									<mrow> r = 1, \quad r = 2, \quad r = 3 </mrow>
								</md>.
								Therefore, the general solution is:
								<me> y = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 e^{3x} </me>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The characteristic equation is:
								<me>
									9 r^5 - 4 r^4 + r + 10 = 0
								</me>
								which is challenging to solve by hand. However, typing it into factoring tool above shows that it can be factored as
								<me>
									2\left(r+3\right)^2 \left(r-1\right) \left(r-\frac12\right) = 0
								</me>,
								which gives the solutions
								<me>
									r = -3, \quad r = -3, \quad r = 1, \quad r = \frac12
								</me>.
								Therefore, the general solution is:
								<me>
									y = (c_1x + c_2) e^{-3x} + c_3 e^{x} + c_4 e^{\frac12 x}
								</me>.

			<p>
				If you want the solutions to a characteristic equation without factoring it, you can also approximate the solutions directly using a numerical solver, as shown in the next example.
			</p>
			
			<example><title> Approximating the Characteristic Solutions </title>
				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:
							<me> y^{(5)} - 4y''' + 3y'' - y = 0 </me>.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>
				
				<solution>
					<p>
						The characteristic equation is:
					</p>

					<me>
						r^5 - 4r^3 + 3r^2 - 1 = 0
					</me>.

					<p>
						Solving this polynomial equation analytically is challenging, so we use a numerical solver (<url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=r%5E5-4*r%5E3%2B3*r%5E2-1">Wolfram Alpha</url>). This equation has five roots. Three are real:
					</p>

					<me> r_1 \approx -2.29, \quad r_2 \approx -0.46, \quad r_3 \approx 1.52, </me>

					<p>
						and two are complex:
					</p>

					<me> r_4 \approx 0.61 + 0.5i, \quad r_5 \approx 0.61 - 0.5i </me>.

					<p>
						The general solution, incorporating these roots, is:
					</p>

					<md>
						<mrow>	y = c_1 e^{-2.29x}	+\amp\ c_2 e^{-0.46x} + c_3 e^{1.52x}				</mrow>
						<mrow>						+\amp\ e^{0.61x} (c_4 \cos(0.5x) + c_5 \sin(0.5x))	</mrow>
					</md>.
				</solution>
			</example>

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				Regardless of the method used, once the roots are found, we can construct the general solution using the principles outlined earlier.
