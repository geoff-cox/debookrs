		<subsubsection><title> Linear Constant Coefficients (LCC) Equations </title>

			<p>
				Before we introduce the full definition of a linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equation, 
				we must first understand two fundamental concepts: <term>linearity</term> and <term>constant coefficients</term>. 
				These two properties determine the structure of the equations we will study in this chapter.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> What Makes a Differential Equation Linear? </title>

				<p>
					A differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if the dependent variable and all of its derivatives appear in a 
					<q>linear</q> fashionâ€”meaning they are not raised to powers, multiplied by each other, or inside nonlinear functions 
					(such as trigonometric or exponential functions). In general, an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation has the form:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="general-linear-de">
					a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = f(x),
				</men>

				<p>
					where <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> are functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>, 
					and <m>f(x)</m> is a given function (which may be zero). The key idea is that <m>y</m> and its derivatives 
					appear only to the first power and are not multiplied by each other. 
				</p>

				<example><title> Identifying Linearity </title>

					<p>
						Determine whether each of the following differential equations is linear.
					</p>

					<me>
						1.\quad y'' + 3y' - 5y = \sin x
					</me>
					<me>
						2.\quad y' + y^2 = x
					</me>
					<me>
						3.\quad e^y y'' + y' = 4x
					</me>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The first equation is linear because all terms involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear in the first power 
							and are not multiplied by each other. The second equation is nonlinear because of the <m>y^2</m> term. 
							The third equation is also nonlinear because <m>e^y</m> appears as a coefficient, making the equation nonlinear in <m>y</m>.
						</p>
					</solution>

				</example>

			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> What Are Constant Coefficients? </title>

				<p>
					A linear differential equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term> if the coefficients 
					<m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> in <xref ref="general-linear-de"/> are all constants rather than functions of <m>x</m>. 
					This means the equation has the standard form:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="constant-coefficient-de">
					a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x),
				</men>

				<p>
					where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are fixed numbers. These equations are particularly useful because 
					their solutions follow systematic patterns that we will explore in later sections.
				</p>

				<example><title> Identifying Constant Coefficients </title>

					<p>
						Determine whether the following equations have constant coefficients.
					</p>

					<me>
						1.\quad y'' + 4y' - 5y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						2.\quad x^2 y'' + 3x y' - 2y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						3.\quad \cos x\ y'' + 2 y' + y = 0
					</me>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The first equation has constant coefficients because each term's coefficient is a fixed number. 
							The second equation does not have constant coefficients because the coefficients <m>x^2</m> and <m>3x</m> depend on <m>x</m>. 
							The third equation also does not have constant coefficients because <m>\cos x</m> is not a constant.
						</p>
					</solution>

				</example>

			<paragraphs><title> Identifying LCC Equations </title>

				<p>
					Now that we have defined linearity and constant coefficients, we can formally define a <term>linear constant coefficient (LCC) equation</term>. 
					An <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation is an LCC equation if:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li> It is <em>linear</em>: <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear to the first power and are not multiplied together.</li>
					<li> It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Here are some examples of LCC equations:
				</p>

				<me>
					1.\quad 2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0
				</me>
				<me>
					2.\quad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
				</me>

				<p>
					Both equations satisfy the two conditions for LCC equations. The coefficients are constants, 
					and the terms involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear in a linear fashion.
				</p>

				<example><title> Checking for LCC Equations </title>

					<p>
						Identify which of the following equations are LCC equations.
					</p>

					<me>
						1.\quad y'' + 2y' + y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						2.\quad x y'' - 3 y' + 2y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						3.\quad y''' + 4y'' - y' + x y = 0
					</me>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The first equation is an LCC equation because it is linear and has constant coefficients. 
							The second equation is not an LCC equation because the coefficient of <m>y''</m> is <m>x</m>, which is not constant. 
							The third equation is not an LCC equation because the term <m>x y</m> makes the equation nonlinear.
						</p>
					</solution>

		<subsubsection><title> Homogeneous vs Nonhomogeneous Equations </title>

			<p>
				Now that we have established what it means for a differential equation to be linear with constant coefficients, 
				we turn our attention to another essential classification: whether an equation is <term>homogeneous</term> or 
				<term>nonhomogeneous</term>. Understanding this distinction is crucial because it affects how we approach solving 
				differential equations.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> What Does "Homogeneous" Mean? </title>

				<p>
					A linear differential equation is called <term>homogeneous</term> if all terms in the equation involve the 
					dependent variable <m>y</m> or its derivatives, and there is no extra function of <m>x</m> on the right-hand side.
					That is, an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation is homogeneous if it has the form:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="homogeneous-de">
					a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0,
				</men>

				<p>
					Notice that the right-hand side is exactly zero. This ensures that every term in the equation involves <m>y</m> 
					or one of its derivatives. The term <m>0</m> on the right-hand side does not introduce any external forcing function.
				</p>

				<example><title> Identifying Homogeneous Equations </title>

					<p>
						Determine whether the following differential equations are homogeneous.
					</p>

					<me>
						1.\quad y'' - 4y' + 3y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						2.\quad y'' + 2y' - y = \cos x
					</me>
					<me>
						3.\quad y''' + 5y'' - y' + 6y = 0
					</me>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The first and third equations are homogeneous because the right-hand side is zero, meaning that all terms involve 
							<m>y</m> and its derivatives. The second equation is not homogeneous because the right-hand side contains <m>\cos x</m>, 
							which is a function of <m>x</m> and does not depend on <m>y</m>.
						</p>
					</solution>

				</example>

			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> What Makes an Equation Nonhomogeneous? </title>

				<p>
					A linear differential equation is <term>nonhomogeneous</term> if there is a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the 
					right-hand side. In other words, an <m>n</m>-th order linear equation is nonhomogeneous if it has the form:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="nonhomogeneous-de">
					a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x),
				</men>

				<p>
					where <m>f(x)</m> is a function of <m>x</m> that does not depend on <m>y</m>. This function <m>f(x)</m> is 
					often called the <term>forcing function</term> because it represents an external influence on the system.
				</p>

				<example><title> Identifying Nonhomogeneous Equations </title>

					<p>
						Determine whether the following differential equations are nonhomogeneous.
					</p>

					<me>
						1.\quad y'' + 2y' + y = 5x
					</me>
					<me>
						2.\quad y'' - 3y' + 4y = 0
					</me>
					<me>
						3.\quad y''' + 6y'' - 4y' + y = e^x
					</me>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The first and third equations are nonhomogeneous because the right-hand sides contain nonzero functions of <m>x</m> 
							(<m>5x</m> and <m>e^x</m>, respectively). The second equation is homogeneous because the right-hand side is zero.
						</p>
					</solution>

				</example>

			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> Why Does This Distinction Matter? </title>

				<p>
					The distinction between homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations is important because it affects how we solve them. 
					The general solution of a homogeneous equation consists entirely of solutions that satisfy the characteristic equation, 
					whereas solving a nonhomogeneous equation requires additional techniques to account for the function <m>f(x)</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					In later chapters, we will explore methods for solving nonhomogeneous equations, but for now, our focus remains on 
					homogeneous equations with constant coefficients.

<section xml:id="sec-"><title>Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

	<subsection><title> What Do Solutions Look Like? </title>

		<p>
			Now that we understand the structure of linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, we turn our attention 
			to their solutions. A natural question arises: <q>What types of functions satisfy these equations?</q> 
			While differential equations in general may have a variety of solutions, we will see that LHCC equations 
			have solutions that follow a specific patternâ€”exponential functions.
		</p>

		<subsubsection><title> Why Exponentials?</title>

			<p>
				To explore the nature of solutions to LHCC equations, let's consider a simple first-order example:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="lhcc-first-order">
				y' - 2y = 0.
			</men>

			<p>
				We seek a function <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies this equation. A key observation is that <m>y'</m> must be 
				proportional to <m>y</m>. A function that exhibits this property is an exponential function:
			</p>

			<me>
				y = e^{rx}.
			</me>

			<p>
				Substituting this guess into the differential equation gives:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> r e^{rx} - 2 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
				<mrow> (r - 2) e^{rx} = 0. </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the only way this equation holds is if <m>r - 2 = 0</m>, which implies <m>r = 2</m>. 
				This confirms that <m>y = e^{2x}</m> is a solution. The reason exponentials work is that their derivatives 
				are simply scaled versions of themselves, which aligns perfectly with the structure of LHCC equations.
			</p>

			<example><title> Testing Different Function Forms </title>

				<p>
					Let's test other function types to see if they satisfy the equation <xref ref="lhcc-first-order"/>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Consider the following candidates:
				</p>

				<me>
					1.\quad y = x^2
				</me>
				<me>
					2.\quad y = \sin x
				</me>
				<me>
					3.\quad y = e^{2x}
				</me>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Calculating the derivatives and substituting them into <xref ref="lhcc-first-order"/>:
					</p>

					<sidebyside>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = x^2, \quad y' = 2x. </mrow>
								<mrow> y' - 2y = 2x - 2x^2 \neq 0 </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = \sin x, \quad y' = \cos x. </mrow>
								<mrow> y' - 2y = \cos x - 2\sin x \neq 0 </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = e^{2x}, \quad y' = 2e^{2x}. </mrow>
								<mrow> y' - 2y = 2e^{2x} - 2e^{2x} = 0. </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
					</sidebyside>

					<p>
						Only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> satisfies the equation, confirming that exponentials are the correct form of solutions.
					</p>
				</solution>

<subsubsection><title> Why Exponentials? (ver 2) </title>

    <p>
        In this section, we explore what kinds of functions satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations.
        While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions
        are always exponential functions. We will see why this is true by examining concrete examples and using the concept of 
        <q>like terms</q> to explain why only exponentials can satisfy these equations.
    </p>

    <subsection><title> A Simple Example </title>

        <p>
            Consider the first-order LHCC equation:
        </p>

        <men xml:id="lhcc-first-order">
            y' - 3y = 0.
        </men>

        <p>
            Our goal is to find a function <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies this equation. Notice that the equation requires <m>y'</m> 
            to be proportional to <m>y</m>. A natural candidate for such a function is an exponential:
        </p>

        <me>
            y = e^{rx}.
        </me>

        <p>
            Substituting this into the differential equation, we compute:
        </p>

        <md>
            <mrow> y' = r e^{rx}. </mrow>
            <mrow> y' - 3y = r e^{rx} - 3 e^{rx} = (r - 3) e^{rx}. </mrow>
        </md>

        <p>
            Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the equation is satisfied only if <m>r - 3 = 0</m>, which implies <m>r = 3</m>. 
            This means <m>y = e^{3x}</m> is a solution to the equation. This key observation generalizes to higher-order equations 
            as well.
        </p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><title> Why Other Functions Do Not Work </title>

        <p>
            To see why exponentials are the only functions that work, let's try substituting other function types into 
            <xref ref="lhcc-first-order"/>.
        </p>

        <example><title> Testing Polynomial and Trigonometric Functions </title>

            <p>
                Consider the differential equation:

            <men>
                y' - 3y = 0.
            </men>

            <p>
                Suppose we try polynomial and trigonometric functions:

            </solution>

        </example>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><title> The Role of Like Terms </title>

        <p>
            The reason exponentials work can be understood using the concept of <term>like terms</term>. In algebra, 
            only like terms can combine or cancel out. Similarly, in differential equations, the terms in an equation 
            must have compatible forms to sum to zero.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking at the equation:
        </p>

        <men>
            y' - 3y = 0,
        </men>

        <p>
            we see that the two terms, <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m>, must cancel each other out. This means they must be <q>like terms</q>, 
            meaning they must share the same functional form. Since the derivative of an exponential function remains an exponential, 
            it is the only function type that meets this requirement.
        </p>

        <example><title> Another Example: A Second-Order Equation </title>

                <p>
                    The polynomial and trigonometric functions do not satisfy the equation, while the exponential function does. 
                    This further illustrates that solutions to LHCC equations must be exponentials.

		<subsubsection><title> Using "Like Terms" to Explain This Behavior </title>

			<p>
				A useful way to understand why exponential functions work is by considering the concept of <term>like terms</term>. 
				In algebra, only like terms can combine or cancel out. Similarly, in differential equations, the terms in an equation 
				must have compatible forms in order to sum to zero.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's revisit our previous example, but now with this perspective. The equation:
			</p>

			<men>
				y' - 2y = 0
			</men>

			<p>
				requires that the two terms, <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m>, cancel each other out. This means they must be <q>like terms</q>â€”they must 
				share the same functional form. Since the derivative of an exponential function remains an exponential, this explains 
				why exponentials naturally satisfy LHCC equations.
			</p>

			<example><title> Exponential vs. Polynomial vs. Trigonometric Functions </title>

				<p>
					Consider the second-order equation:
				</p>

				<men>
					y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0.
				</men>

				<p>
					Suppose we try polynomial, trigonometric, and exponential functions:
				</p>

				<me>
					1.\quad y = x^3
				</me>
				<me>
					2.\quad y = \cos x
				</me>
				<me>
					3.\quad y = e^{2x}
				</me>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Computing the derivatives:
					</p>

					<sidebyside>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = x^3, \quad y' = 3x^2, \quad y'' = 6x. </mrow>
								<mrow> y'' - 5y' + 6y = 6x - 5(3x^2) + 6(x^3) \neq 0. </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = \cos x, \quad y' = -\sin x, \quad y'' = -\cos x. </mrow>
								<mrow> y'' - 5y' + 6y = -\cos x - 5(-\sin x) + 6(\cos x) \neq 0. </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow> y = e^{2x}, \quad y' = 2e^{2x}, \quad y'' = 4e^{2x}. </mrow>
								<mrow> y'' - 5y' + 6y = 4e^{2x} - 5(2e^{2x}) + 6(e^{2x}) = 0. </mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
					</sidebyside>

					<p>
						The polynomial and trigonometric functions do not satisfy the equation, while the exponential function does. 
						This further illustrates that solutions to LHCC equations must be exponentials.

			<ul>
				<li> The solutions to LHCC equations are exponential functions because their derivatives preserve the same functional form. </li>
				<li> The concept of <q>like terms</q> helps explain why other function types (polynomials, trigonometric functions) do not work. </li>
				<li> By substituting an exponential <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for <m>r</m>, which determines the general solution. </li>
