<chapter><title> Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient Differential Equations (LHCC Equations) </title>

	<section><title> Introduction to LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we take our first steps into understanding <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations. 
				Before we fully define and analyze these equations, it is important to explore their fundamental building blocks: 
				<term>linearity</term> and <term>constant coefficients</term>. These two properties determine the structure of LHCC equations 
				and play a crucial role in their solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				First, we will examine what it means for a differential equation to be <em>linear</em>. This means that the dependent variable 
				and its derivatives appear in a straightforward manner—without being raised to powers, multiplied together, or appearing inside 
				nonlinear functions such as exponentials or trigonometric expressions. Next, we will define what it means for a differential equation 
				to have <em>constant coefficients</em>—where the coefficients of each derivative remain fixed rather than varying with the independent variable.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once we establish these two ideas, we will formally introduce <term>Linear Constant Coefficient (LCC)</term> equations, 
				which form the foundation for studying LHCC equations. Finally, we will distinguish between <em>homogeneous</em> and <em>nonhomogeneous</em> equations, 
				a key classification that influences solution techniques.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the end of this subsection, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying LHCC equations, 
				preparing you to explore their solutions in later sections.

					A differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if the dependent variable and all of its derivatives appear in a 
					<q>linear</q> fashion—meaning they are not raised to powers, multiplied by each other, or inside nonlinear functions 
					(such as trigonometric or exponential functions). In general, an <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation has the form:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="general-linear-de00">
					a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = f(x),

				<p>
					where <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> are functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>, 
					and <m>f(x)</m> is a given function (which may be zero). The key idea is that <m>y</m> and its derivatives 
					appear only to the first power and are not multiplied by each other.

						<p>
							The first equation is linear because all terms involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives appear in the first power

		<!-- <subsection><title> Solutions to LHCC Equations </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Now that we have established the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, 
					the next step is to explore how to solve them. While differential equations can sometimes have complex or unpredictable solutions, 
					LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions follow a systematic and predictable pattern, making them easier to analyze.
				</p>

				<p>
					The key insight in solving LHCC equations is recognizing that their solutions are often <em>exponential functions</em>. 
					By assuming solutions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>, we can transform a differential equation into an algebraic equation known as the 
					<term>characteristic equation</term>. Solving this equation gives us values for <m>r</m>, which in turn determine the form of the 
					general solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this section, we will explore why exponentials naturally arise as solutions, develop techniques for solving LHCC equations systematically, 
					and examine how different types of characteristic roots—real, repeated, and complex—affect the nature of the solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the end of this section, you will have a solid understanding of the solution process for LHCC equations, enabling you to solve them efficiently 
					and interpret their behavior in various applied contexts.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> What Do Solutions Look Like? </title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Now that we understand the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, 
						we turn our attention to their solutions. What kinds of functions satisfy these equations? How do we determine the general form of solutions?
					</p>

					<p>
						Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a highly structured solution method. 
						Their solutions take on a predictable form, allowing us to develop a systematic approach for solving them. 
						Through examples and analysis, we will discover that <em>exponential functions</em> play a central role in solving LHCC equations. 
						By assuming solutions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m> and substituting into the equation, we obtain an algebraic equation for <m>r</m>—the <em>characteristic equation</em>. 
						The solutions to this characteristic equation directly determine the general solution to the differential equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this subsection, we will explore why exponentials naturally arise as solutions, examine what happens when different types of characteristic roots appear, 
						and build an intuitive understanding of why other function types (such as polynomials or trigonometric functions) do not generally satisfy LHCC equations. 
						By the end of this discussion, you will have a clear picture of what solutions to LHCC equations look like and why they take the forms they do.
					</p>
				</introduction>

				<subsubsection><title> Why Exponentials? </title>

					<p>
						In this section, we explore what kinds of functions satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations.
						While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions
						are always exponential functions. We will see why this is true by examining concrete examples and using the concept of 
						<q>like terms</q> to explain why only exponentials can satisfy these equations.
					</p>

					<paragraphs><title> A Simple Example </title>

						<p>
							Consider the first-order LHCC equation:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="lhcc-first-order">
							y' - 3y = 0.
						</men>

						<p>
							Our goal is to find a function <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies this equation. Notice that the equation requires <m>y'</m> 
							to be proportional to <m>y</m>. A natural candidate for such a function is an exponential:
						</p>

						<me>
							y = e^{rx}.
						</me>

						<p>
							Substituting this into the differential equation, we compute:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> y' = r e^{rx}. </mrow>
							<mrow> y' - 3y = r e^{rx} - 3 e^{rx} = (r - 3) e^{rx}. </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the equation is satisfied only if <m>r - 3 = 0</m>, which implies <m>r = 3</m>. 
							This means <m>y = e^{3x}</m> is a solution to the equation. This key observation generalizes to higher-order equations 
							as well.
						</p>

					<paragraphs><title> Why Other Functions Do Not Work </title>

						<p>
							To see why exponentials are the only functions that work, let's try substituting other function types into 
							<xref ref="lhcc-first-order"/>.

				<p>
					Now that we understand the structure of linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, we turn our attention 
					to their solutions. A natural question arises: <q>What types of functions satisfy these equations?</q> 
					While differential equations in general may have a variety of solutions, we will see that LHCC equations 
					have solutions that follow a specific pattern—exponential functions.
				</p>

				<subsubsection><title> Why Exponentials? </title>

					<p>
						To explore the nature of solutions to LHCC equations, let's consider a simple first-order example:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="lhcc-first-order">
						y' - 2y = 0.
					</men>

					<p>
						We seek a function <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies this equation. A key observation is that <m>y'</m> must be 
						proportional to <m>y</m>. A function that exhibits this property is an exponential function:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = e^{rx}.
					</me>

					<p>
						Substituting this guess into the differential equation gives:
					</p>

					<md>
						<mrow> r e^{rx} - 2 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
						<mrow> (r - 2) e^{rx} = 0. </mrow>
					</md>

					<p>
						Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the only way this equation holds is if <m>r - 2 = 0</m>, which implies <m>r = 2</m>. 
						This confirms that <m>y = e^{2x}</m> is a solution. The reason exponentials work is that their derivatives 
						are simply scaled versions of themselves, which aligns perfectly with the structure of LHCC equations.

					<p>
						In this section, we explore what kinds of functions satisfy linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations.
						While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit a remarkable property: their solutions
						are always exponential functions. We will see why this is true by examining concrete examples and using the concept of 
						<q>like terms</q> to explain why only exponentials can satisfy these equations.

						<p>
							Our goal is to find a function <m>y(x)</m> that satisfies this equation. Notice that the equation requires <m>y'</m> 
							to be proportional to <m>y</m>. A natural candidate for such a function is an exponential:
						</p>

						<me>
							y = e^{rx}.
						</me>

						<p>
							Substituting this into the differential equation, we compute:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> y' = r e^{rx}. </mrow>
							<mrow> y' - 3y = r e^{rx} - 3 e^{rx} = (r - 3) e^{rx}. </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, the equation is satisfied only if <m>r - 3 = 0</m>, which implies <m>r = 3</m>.

						leads to the general solution, which contains arbitrary constants that allow us to satisfy initial conditions or boundary conditions.
					</p>

						We will also introduce the <em>characteristic equation</em>, an algebraic equation whose solutions determine the independent 
						exponential functions that form the general solution. By analyzing different types of characteristic roots—real, repeated, 
						and complex—we will see how they affect the structure of the solution.

						is a direct consequence of the structure of LHCC equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this subsection, we will derive the characteristic equation by substituting an exponential function into

						The characteristic equation is the key to solving <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations,

					</p>

					<p>
						In this subsection, we will derive the characteristic equation step by step. Starting with a general LHCC equation, we will assume

				<subsubsection><title> Derivation of the Characteristic Equation </title>

					<p>
						In the previous sections, we established that solutions to linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations 
						take the form of exponential functions. In this section, we formally derive the <term>characteristic equation</term>, a polynomial 
						equation that determines the possible values of <m>r</m> in the exponential solutions <m>y = e^{rx}</m>.
					</p>

					<paragraphs><title> Setting Up the Characteristic Equation </title>

						<p>
							Consider an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC differential equation of the form:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="general-lhcc">
							a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0.
						</men>

						<p>
							We assume a solution of the form:
						</p>

						<me>
							y = e^{rx}.
						</me>

						<p>
							Differentiating <m>y</m> repeatedly gives:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow> y' = r e^{rx}, </mrow>
							<mrow> y'' = r^2 e^{rx}, </mrow>
							<mrow> y^{(n)} = r^n e^{rx}. </mrow>
						</md>

						<p>
							Substituting these expressions into equation <xref ref="general-lhcc"/> results in:
						</p>

						<me>
							a_n r^n e^{rx} + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} e^{rx} + \dots + a_1 r e^{rx} + a_0 e^{rx} = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we can factor it out:
						</p>

						<me>
							e^{rx} \left( a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 r + a_0 \right) = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							The exponential function <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero for any finite value of <m>x</m>, so the only way this equation 
							can hold for all <m>x</m> is if the expression inside the parentheses is zero:
						</p>

						<me xml:id="characteristic-equation">
							a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							This polynomial equation in <m>r</m> is called the <term>characteristic equation</term> of the differential equation.
							The solutions of this equation determine the values of <m>r</m> that define the fundamental exponential solutions.

							<p>
								Factoring using the binomial theorem:
							</p>

		<subsection><title> First and Second Order Equations </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The simplest cases of LHCC equations are those of first and second order. First-order equations involve only 
					the first derivative of the unknown function, while second-order equations include the second derivative as well. 
					Understanding how to solve these equations provides the foundation for tackling higher-order cases.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this subsection, we will first examine first-order LHCC equations, which always yield a single exponential solution. 
					Then, we will explore second-order equations, where the characteristic equation is quadratic, leading to distinct, 
					repeated, or complex conjugate roots. Each case results in a different form of the general solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the end of this subsection, you will be able to systematically solve both first-order and second-order LHCC 
					equations using the characteristic equation and interpret how different root types influence the nature of solutions.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> First-Order Equations </title>

				<p>
					First-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations are the simplest case of LHCC differential equations. 
					These equations involve only the first derivative of the unknown function and a constant coefficient. Despite their simplicity, 
					they provide an important foundation for solving higher-order LHCC equations.
				</p>

				<paragraphs><title> The General Form </title>

					<p>
						A first-order LHCC equation has the general form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="first-order-lhcc">

					</men>

					<p>
						where <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m> are constants, with <m>a_1 \neq 0</m> to ensure the equation is truly first-order. 
						Our goal is to determine the general solution for <m>y(x)</m>.
					</p>

				<paragraphs><title> Solving First-Order LHCC Equations </title>

					<p>
						To solve equation <xref ref="first-order-lhcc"/>, we assume an exponential solution of the form:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = e^{rx}.
					</me>

					<p>
						Differentiating this expression gives:
					</p>

					<me>
						y' = r e^{rx}.

						Substituting these into <xref ref="first-order-lhcc"/> results in:

					<me>
						a_1 r e^{rx} + a_0 e^{rx} = 0.

					<p>
						First-order LHCC equations are the simplest case because:

						<li> The characteristic equation is always linear, leading to a single exponential solution.</li>
						<li> There is no need to consider repeated or complex roots, as in higher-order equations.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This simplicity makes first-order equations an excellent introduction to solving LHCC differential equations. 
						The method used here—assuming an exponential solution and solving the characteristic equation—applies directly 
						to higher-order cases.

					Now that we have mastered first-order LHCC equations, we move on to second-order equations, where new solution behaviors emerge.

					Second-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations introduce new solution behaviors that do not arise in the first-order case.

				<paragraphs><title> The General Form </title>

					<p>
						A general <m>n</m>-th order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equation takes the form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="higher-order-lhcc">
						a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0,
					</men>

					<p>
						where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_1, a_0</m> are constant coefficients, and <m>y^{(n)}</m> represents the <m>n</m>-th derivative of <m>y</m>. 
						Our goal is to determine the general solution for <m>y(x)</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						As in the second-order case, the key to solving this equation is to find functions whose derivatives satisfy a similar structure. 
						We will see that, once again, exponential functions provide the fundamental solutions.
					</p>

				</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs><title> Why Exponentials Still Work </title>

					<p>
						To solve a higher-order LHCC equation, we assume an exponential solution of the form:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = e^{rx}.
					</me>

					<p>
						Differentiating this function multiple times gives:
					</p>

					<md>
						<mrow> y' = r e^{rx}, </mrow>
						<mrow> y'' = r^2 e^{rx}, </mrow>
						<mrow> y^{(n)} = r^n e^{rx}. </mrow>
					</md>

					<p>
						Substituting these expressions into equation <xref ref="higher-order-lhcc"/> results in:
					</p>

					<me>
						a_n r^n e^{rx} + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} e^{rx} + \cdots + a_1 r e^{rx} + a_0 e^{rx} = 0.
					</me>

					<p>
						Factoring out <m>e^{rx}</m>, we obtain the characteristic equation:
					</p>

					<me xml:id="higher-order-characteristic">
						a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0.
					</me>

					<p>
						This equation, a polynomial in <m>r</m> of degree <m>n</m>, determines the values of <m>r</m> that lead to valid exponential solutions. 
						The solutions of this characteristic equation dictate the fundamental solution set for <xref ref="higher-order-lhcc"/>.
					</p>

				</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs><title> The General Solution for Higher Orders </title>

					<p>
						Since the characteristic equation is a polynomial of degree <m>n</m>, it has <m>n</m> roots (real or complex). 
						The general solution depends on the nature of these roots:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> If all roots are distinct and real, the solution consists of <m>n</m> independent exponential terms.</li>
						<li> If there are repeated roots, additional polynomial factors appear.</li>
						<li> If there are complex conjugate roots, the solution involves sine and cosine functions.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						More formally, if the characteristic equation has roots <m>r_1, r_2, \dots, r_n</m>, then the general solution takes the form:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = c_1 e^{r_1 x} + c_2 e^{r_2 x} + \dots + c_n e^{r_n x}.
					</me>

					<p>
						If a root <m>r</m> has multiplicity <m>m</m>, then the solution includes additional polynomial terms:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = (c_1 + c_2 x + \dots + c_m x^{m-1}) e^{r x}.
					</me>

					<p>
						If the characteristic equation has complex conjugate roots <m>\alpha \pm i\beta</m>, the solution is written as:
					</p>

					<me>
						y = e^{\alpha x} (c_1 \cos(\beta x) + c_2 \sin(\beta x)).
					</me>

					<p>
						The number of independent solutions always matches the order of the differential equation, ensuring that the general solution captures all possible behaviors.
					</p>

				<paragraphs><title> Example: A Third-Order LHCC Equation </title>

					<example><title> Solving a Third-Order LHCC Equation </title>

						<p>
							Consider the third-order equation:
						</p>

						<men>
							y''' - 4y'' + 5y' - 2y = 0.
						</men>

						<p>
							The characteristic equation is:
						</p>

						<me>
							r^3 - 4r^2 + 5r - 2 = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							Factoring, we find:
						</p>

						<me>
							(r - 1)(r - 2)(r - 1) = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							This gives the roots <m>r_1 = 1</m> (repeated) and <m>r_2 = 2</m>. Since <m>r_1</m> is a repeated root, the general solution takes the form:
						</p>

						<me>
							y = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 x e^{x} + c_3 e^{2x}.
						</me>

					</example>

				<outcomes><title> Key Takeaways </title>
					<ul>
						<li> Higher-order LHCC equations follow the same principles as second-order ones, with solutions determined by the characteristic equation.</li>
						<li> The characteristic equation is an <m>n</m>-th degree polynomial whose roots determine the independent solutions.</li>

			<subsubsection><title> Solving the Characteristic Equation </title>

				<p>
					In the previous section, we derived the characteristic equation, which determines the fundamental solutions of higher-order LHCC equations.
					However, solving this polynomial equation can be challenging, especially as the order of the differential equation increases.
					In this section, we explore the difficulties of solving higher-degree polynomials, discuss special cases where solutions are easier to find,
					and introduce modern technological tools that can assist in solving characteristic equations efficiently.
				</p>

				<paragraphs><title> Challenges in Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials </title>

					<p>
						The characteristic equation for an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation is an <m>n</m>-th degree polynomial:
					</p>

					<me xml:id="general-characteristic">
						a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0.
					</me>

					<p>
						While solving quadratic (<m>n=2</m>) characteristic equations is straightforward using the quadratic formula, higher-degree equations introduce significant challenges:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> <em>Cubic and quartic equations</em> (<m>n=3</m> or <m>n=4</m>) have general formulas, but they are complex and rarely used in practice.</li>
						<li> <em>Polynomial equations of degree five or higher</em> (<m>n \geq 5</m>) generally cannot be solved using a formula (Abel-Ruffini theorem).</li>
						<li> <em>Factoring becomes difficult</em> as the number of possible rational roots increases.</li>
						<li> <em>Complex and repeated roots require additional algebraic manipulation</em>, making hand calculations cumbersome.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						In many cases, direct algebraic methods are impractical for finding exact solutions, necessitating alternative approaches.
					</p>

				</paragraphs>

				<paragraphs><title> Special Cases That Simplify Solutions </title>

					<p>
						Despite these challenges, some characteristic equations can be solved more easily if they fall into special cases. These include:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li> <em>Quadratic Polynomials:</em> The quadratic formula provides an explicit solution for <m>n=2</m>: 
							<me>
								r = \frac{-a_1 \pm \sqrt{a_1^2 - 4a_0 a_2}}{2a_2}.
							</me>
						</li>
						<li> <em>Rational Roots:</em> If the coefficients are integers, the <em>rational root theorem</em> helps identify possible rational solutions.</li>
						<li> <em>Factoring by Inspection:</em> Some polynomials can be factored directly, especially when they have simple integer roots.</li>
						<li> <em>Repeated Roots:</em> When a root appears multiple times, recognizing it allows for polynomial reduction.</li>
						<li> <em>Complex Conjugate Roots:</em> For equations with real coefficients, complex roots always appear in conjugate pairs <m>(\alpha \pm i\beta)</m>, reducing the number of unknowns.</li>
					</ul>

					<example><title> Factoring a Simple Cubic Polynomial </title>

						<p>
							Solve the characteristic equation:
						</p>

						<me>
							r^3 - 6r^2 + 11r - 6 = 0.
						</me>

						<solution>
							<p>
								Using the rational root theorem, we test integer factors of <m>-6</m>: <m>\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6</m>. 
								Substituting <m>r = 1</m>, we get:
							</p>

							<me>
								(1)^3 - 6(1)^2 + 11(1) - 6 = 0.
							</me>

							<p>
								Since <m>r = 1</m> is a root, we factor <m>(r - 1)</m> from the polynomial using polynomial division:
							</p>

							<me>
								(r - 1)(r^2 - 5r + 6) = 0.
							</me>

							<p>
								Factoring the quadratic term:
							</p>

							<me>
								(r - 1)(r - 2)(r - 3) = 0.
							</me>

							<p>
								Thus, the roots are <m>r = 1, 2, 3</m>, and the general solution is:
							</p>

							<me>
								y = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x} + c_3 e^{3x}.
							</me>

						</solution>

				<paragraphs><title> Using Technology to Solve Characteristic Equations </title>

					<p>
						For characteristic equations that are difficult to solve by hand, technology provides powerful tools for finding exact or approximate roots.
						Some commonly used methods include:
					</p>

								Using Python's NumPy library, we execute:
							</p>

							<codeblock>
							import numpy as np
							roots = np.roots([1, -3, 2, -1, 1])
							print(roots)
							</codeblock>

							<p>
								The output gives:
							</p>

							<me>
								r_1 = 2, \quad r_2 \approx 0.618, \quad r_3, r_4 \approx -0.809 \pm i 0.588.
							</me>

							<p>
								The general solution is then:
							</p>

							<me>
								y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{0.618x} + e^{-0.809x} (c_3 \cos(0.588x) + c_4 \sin(0.588x)).
							</me>

						</solution>

				<p>
					In this section, we apply the methods developed in previous sections to solve concrete examples of higher-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) differential equations. By working through these examples step by step, we will reinforce the key concepts, including the use of the characteristic equation and the interpretation of different root types.
				</p>

						<p>
							Consider the third-order differential equation:
						</p>

						<men>
							y''' - 6y'' + 11y' - 6y = 0.
						</men>

						<p>
							We begin by finding the characteristic equation:
						</p>

						<me>

						<p>
							Factoring the polynomial:
						</p>

						<me>
							(r - 1)(r - 2)(r - 3) = 0.
						</me>

						<p>
							This gives the distinct real roots <m>r = 1, 2, 3</m>. Thus, the general solution is:
						</p>

						<me>
