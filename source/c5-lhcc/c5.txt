	<introduction>

		<p>
			As we delve deeper into the world of differential equations, it's time to expand our solution techniques beyond first-order equations. Higher-order linear differential equations, those involving second derivatives or higher, are fundamental in modeling more complex systems in physics, engineering, and other fields.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this part of the text, we will explore a special class of differential equations known as <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>. Within these equations is another subclass of homogeneous and nonhomogeneous differential equations, which have a rich theory and many applications in science and engineering. We will learn how to solve these equations using a variety of methods, including the characteristic equation, undetermined coefficients, and variation of parameters. By mastering these methods, you'll gain a robust toolkit for solving a wide range of higher-order linear differential equations.

		<introduction>
			
			<p>
				As you might expect, solving differential equations becomes more challenging as the order of the derivative increases. But don't worry! There's a class of higher-order equations that are not only approachable but also serve as a gateway to more advanced topics. These are known as linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC for short.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we progress into higher-order differential equations, we encounter a particularly structured and solvable class: <term>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</term> (LHCC equations). These equations arise frequently in scientific and engineering applications, governing systems such as oscillating springs, electrical circuits, and fluid dynamics. Their predictable structure allows for powerful solution techniques that generalize well across different disciplines.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter, we will explore the structure of LHCC equations, discuss why exponentials naturally arise as their solutions, and develop techniques to find general solutions for first-order, second-order, and higher-order cases. By assuming solutions take the form of exponentials, we reduce differential equations to algebraic equations, making them much easier to handle.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter, we will explore the defining characteristics of LHCC equations, demonstrating why exponential functions naturally emerge as their solutions. By reducing differential equations to algebraic ones, we simplify the process of solving them and uncover fundamental patterns in their behavior. This approach not only provides insight into the nature of differential equations but also lays the foundation for tackling more complex systems.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				These equations arise frequently in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics due to their well-defined solution methods and predictable behavior. Many natural systems, from mechanical vibrations to electrical circuits, are governed by LHCC equations, making them essential tools for modeling the world around us. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We will begin by identifying what makes an equation linear, homogeneous, and constant coefficient, ensuring a clear understanding of the terminology and structure. From there, we will develop systematic methods to find general solutions, leveraging the characteristic equation to determine the form of solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid grasp of how to approach and solve LHCC equations, preparing you for further exploration into nonhomogeneous cases and applied problem-solving.

			<introduction>

				<p>
					In this subsection, we take our first steps into understanding <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations. 
					Before we fully define and analyze these equations, it is important to explore their fundamental building blocks: <term>linear (L)</term>, <term>homogeneous (H)</term>, and <term>constant coefficients (CC)</term>. These three properties determine the structure of LHCC equations and the types of solutions you will get from these equations.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the end of this subsection, you will have a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts underlying LHCC equations, preparing you for finding their solutions in later sections.

			<subsection><title> Identifying LHCC Equations </title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Before diving into the methods for solving linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations), we first need to understand what these equations look like and how to recognize them. The term "LHCC" captures three essential characteristics: <em>linearity</em>, <em>homogeneity</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>. Let's break these down one by one.
					</p>
				</introduction>

				<subsubsection><title> The <q>L</q> in LHCC </title>
					
					<p>
						Recall, a differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if it can be written as 
						<me>
							\text{Sum of Linear Terms } = \text{ Constant Term}
						</me>
						where a term is linear if it contains, at most, a single dependent variable raised to power of one and not inside another function. The constant term is the collection of all terms that do not contain a dependent variable. 
					</p>

					<p>
						So, every <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation can be organized as follows:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
						\us{	\large\text{of } y^{(n)}	}{
						\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{ 
								\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_n(x)}	}}\ y^{(n)}
						}}	+ \cdots +
						\us{	\large\text{of } y''		}{
						\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
								\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)}	}}\ y''
						}}	+
						\us{	\large\text{of } y'			}{
						\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
								\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_1(x)}	}}\ y'
						}}	+
						\us{	\large\text{of } y			}{
						\us{	\large\text{coefficient }	}{
								\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_0(x)}	}}\ y
						}}	=
						\us{	\large\text{term}			}{ 
						\us{	\large\text{constant }		}{
								\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{f(x)}	}}
						}}
					</men>

					<p>
						where the coefficients, <m>a_n(x), a_{n-1}(x), \dots, a_1(x), a_0(x)</m> and the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, are functions that depend only on the independent variable <m>x</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Examples of <m>\quad</m> 
						<xref ref="linear-equation-examples" text="custom">		üëâ Linear Equations		</xref> <m>\quad</m> 
						<xref ref="nonlinear-equation-examples" text="custom">	üëâ Nonlinear Equations	</xref>
					</p>

					
				</subsubsection>

				<subsubsection><title> The <q>CC</q> in LHCC </title>

					<p>
						A linear differential equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term> if all of the coefficients in the equation are constant (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>). 
						<aside>
							<p>
								‚òùÔ∏è <term>Remember!</term> Constant terms are not coefficients.
							</p>
						</aside>
						This condition results in dropping <q><m>(x)</m></q> on each coefficient in equation <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/>.
					</p>

					<p>
						So, every linear differential equation with constant coefficients has the form
					</p>

					<men xml:id="constant-coefficient-de">
						a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x),
					</men>

					<p>
						where <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants. Here are some examples of linear differential equations with constant coefficients:
					</p>

					<me>
						2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
					</me>

				</subsubsection>

				<subsubsection><title> The <q>H</q> in LHCC </title>

					<p>
						To state that a linear differential equation is <term>homogeneous</term> is to say that the constant term, <m>f(x)</m>, is zero. When the constant is nonzero (i.e., <m>f(x) \neq 0</m>), we say the equation is <term>nonhomogeneous</term>. Therefore, setting <m>f(x) = 0</m> in <xref ref="linear-equation-w-coefficents"/> leads to the form for any linear homogeneous differential equation:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="homogeneous-de">
						a_n(x) y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x) y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1(x) y' + a_0(x) y = 0.
					</men>

					<p>
						This condition implies that every term in the equation must involve the dependent variable <m>y</m> or one of its derivatives. 
					</p>

				</subsubsection>

				<subsubsection><title> LHCC Equations </title>
					
					<p>
						Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
					</p>
					
					<definition xml:id="def-lhcc"><title>LHCC Equation</title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
							</p>
							<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
								a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
							</men>
							<p>
								where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
							</p>
						</statement>
					</definition>
					
					<p>
						Since LHCC equations are the types of equations that our next method will solve, let's make sure we can identify these equations with an example.
					</p>
					
				</subsubsection>

				<example>
					<p>
						<statement>
							<p>
								Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
							</p>
							<me>
								3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad
								\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad
								\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s
							</me>
							<p>
								Determine which of the following equations have constant coefficients.
							</p>
							<me>
								3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad
								\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad
								s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
							</me>
							<p>
								For each of the following differential equations, identify the coefficients and state whether they are constants or functions of the independent variable:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li> <m>y'' + 4y' + 6y = 0</m>, </li>
								<li> <m>x^2 y'' + xy' + y = \ln(x)</m>, </li>
								<li> <m>u'' + 2xu' + u = 5x</m>. </li>
							</ol>
						</statement>
					</p>
					<p>
						<solution>
							<p>
								The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
							</p>
							<p>
								<me>
								3y'' - 2ty' + y = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}, \quad
								\frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{BurntOrange} -3x^2}, \quad
								\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{BurntOrange} 0}
								</me>.
							</p>
							<p>
								The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.
							</p>
						</solution>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Check if each coefficient is constant:
							</p>
							<p>
								<me>
									\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{3}}} y'' -
									\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{2\tau}}}\ y' +
									\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} y = \tau, \quad
									\sqrt{t} -
									\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} \frac{dP}{dt} -
									\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{1}{2}}}} P^2 = 1, \quad
									\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} s''' =
									\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}} s
								</me>.
								The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.

				<conclusion>
					<p>
						In summary, a differential equation is classified as an <xref ref="lhcc-equation">LHCC equation</xref> if it satisfies three criteria:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
						<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
						<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						With this understanding, we are now ready to explore how to find solutions to LHCC equations. The next section introduces an 
						intuitive approach to understanding what the solutions to these equations look like.

						Now that we have established the structure of <term>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC)</term> differential equations, the next step is to explore the kinds of functions that satisfy these equations. While differential equations can have a wide range of solutions, LHCC equations exhibit surprisingly limited set of possible solutions.

				<subsubsection><title> What Do Solutions Look Like? </title>

					<introduction>
						<p>
							The next task is to take a closer look at the <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">LHCC Property 1</xref>. In this discussion, we will use our knowledge of calculus and algebra to logically justify why exponential functions naturally satisfy these types of equations. 
						</p>
					</introduction>

					<p>
						A useful way to understand what types of solutions to expect is with the concept of <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom"><term>like terms</term></xref>. In algebra, when you add two like terms together they can be simplified by adding their coefficients. Like terms are also the only terms that can <q>cancel out</q> through addition or subtraction. <m>^üìå</m>
						<aside>
							<p>
								<term>üìå Note:</term> We are using <q>like terms</q> to represent the more advanced notion of linearly dependence of functions.
							</p>
						</aside>
					</p>

					<p>
						Using this perspective, let's consider the following simple LHCC equation,
					</p>

					<me>
						y' - 2y = 0
					</me>.

					<p>
						To be a solution, we would expect any function that we plug in for <m>y</m> to result in <m>0 = 0</m>. That is, after plugging in a function of <m>x</m> for each <m>y</m> all the terms must cancel out, simplifying the left side to zero. The only types of terms that do this are <q>like terms</q>! So, looking back at our equation, we see that <m>y'</m> and <m>2y</m> must give us like terms after plugging in a function. But, what kind of function is a like term with its own derivative?
					</p>

					<p>
						You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is always another exponential function, so perhaps we are on to something. To convince ourselves, let's plug in a few different functions for <m>y</m> and see if we get any like terms.
					</p>

					<p>
						As you can see, only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that simplify to zero. This is why exponential functions often work well in LHCC equations. Let's now examine a more complex example to build upon this idea.

					<conclusion>

						<p>
							Our goal was to examine <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">LHCC Property 1</xref> and these examples are evidence that exponential functions have a perfect structure as solutions to these types of equations. 
						</p>

						<theorem><title> What about <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> as solutions? </title>
						<statement>
							<p>
								If you are wondering why we didn't include <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> in the list of possible <q>like term</q> solutions, then you have a good grasp of this material. Indeed, the fact that derivatives of <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> cycle back to themselves with every second derivative, indicates that they can also produce like terms, which combine when plugged into certain differential equations.
							</p>

							<p>
								The reason we didn't include them is because exponentials actually encompass <m>\sin x</m> and <m>\cos x</m> as special cases when <m>r</m> in <m>e^{rx}</m> is a complex number. In particular, if <m>r</m> can be expressed as <m>r = ib</m>, then <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="custom">Euler's formula</xref> tells us that

					<p>
						The general solution to an LHCC equation is established based on the <q><xref ref="lhcc-soln-properties" text="title"/></q> mentioned in the introduction along with a key property of linear differential equations known as the <term>principle of superposition</term>. This principle states that if <m>y_1</m> and <m>y_2</m> are solutions to a linear equation, then so is <m>c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2</m>, for any constants <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>. To understand this, let's illustrate these properties on the equation from a previous example. 
					</p>

					<p>
						In <xref ref="lhcc-soln-example-1"/>, we determined the LHCC equation,
					</p>

					<me>
						y'' - 3y' - 4y = 0
					</me>

					<p>
						has two solutions, <m>y_1 = e^{4x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{-x}</m>. Since this equation has 2nd order, we expect exactly two solutions. Therefore, our two exponential solutions from <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-1" text="custom">property 1</xref> have been established.
					</p>

					<p>
						<xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-2" text="custom">Property 2</xref> tells us that our exponential solutions, <m>y_1 = e^{4x}</m> and <m>y_2 = e^{-x}</m> cannot be like terms. This is true, since they have different exponents and cannot be combined into a single term with addition. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, <xref ref="lhcc-soln-property-3" text="custom">property 3</xref> (principle of superposition) leads to the general solution,
					</p>

					<me>
						y = c_1 e^{4x} + c_2 e^{-x}
					</me>.

					<p>
						In general, as long as we have the <m>n</m> independent exponential solutions, <m>y_1</m>, <m>y_2</m>, <m>\dots</m>, <m>y_n</m> of the form <xref ref="lhcc-soln-form"/>, then the general solution is,
					</p>

					<me>
						y = c_1 y_1 + c_2 y_2 + \cdots + c_n y_n
					</me>

					<p>
						for any constants <m>c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n</m>. 
					</p>

					<conclusion>
						<p>
							This shows how to construct the general solution to any LHCC equation given the exponential functions that satisfy the equation. In the next section, we will explore how to find these exponential solutions through finding the roots of a polynomial equation called the characteristic equation.

			<subsection><title> The Characteristic Equation </title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						This section introduces a systematic approach to solving LHCC equations. The key idea is to transform a differential equation into an algebraic equation‚Äîknown as the <term>characteristic equation</term>‚Äîwhich determines the behavior of the solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will see that solving these higher-order equations can be as simple as finding the roots of a polynomial.
					</p>

					<p>
						Solving linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations correspond to finding the roots of a polynomial called the <term>characteristic equation</term>. This equation is derived by substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the LHCC equation and solving for <m>r</m>.
					</p>

				<p>
					In general, the characteristic equation will have <m>n</m> roots, which may be real or complex and may also include repeated roots. Each root of the characteristic equation leads to a term in the general solution of the LHCC. Examples in the table below illustrate the process of constructing these general solutions based on the different types of roots.

						These factoring techniques useful, but they only apply to specific forms of polynomials and it is unlikely that you will be lucky enough to encounter such forms in practice.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In the previous section, we learned that solutions to Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations often involve terms of the form <m>e^{rx}</m>. However, not every value of <m>r</m> will work. The correct values of <m>r</m> arise from solving an important algebraic equation, obtained by substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the differential equation. In this section, we will focus on this process for first-order equations before building up to higher-order cases.
					</p>
				</introduction>
				
				<p>
					Let's start with a simple first-order equation:
					<me> y' - 5y = 0 </me>
					We want to find the value of <m>r</m> such that <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is a solution. Substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the differential equation gives:
					<md>
						<mrow> \left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right] =\amp 0 </mrow>
						<mrow> r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx} 							=\amp 0 </mrow>
						<mrow> (r - 5) e^{rx} 								=\amp 0 </mrow>
					</md>
					Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we must have:
					<md>
						<mrow> r - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5 </mrow>
					</md>
					This tells us that <m>y = e^{5x}</m> is a solution. Therefore, the general solution is:
					<me> y = c e^{5x} </me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The equation <m>r - 5 = 0</m>, which gave us the value of <m>r</m>, is called the <term>characteristic equation</term>. Every LHCC equation has one. The characteristic equation gives us the values of <m>r</m> that we need to construct the general solution.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Applying the same approach to the general first-order LHCC equation gives us:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							y=e^{rx} \quad\rightarrow\quad
							ay' + by = 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad a \left[e^{rx}\right]' + b \left[e^{rx}\right]
														=\amp 0
						</mrow>
						<mrow> a r e^{rx} + b e^{rx}	=\amp 0 </mrow>
						<mrow> (ar + b) e^{rx} 			=\amp 0 </mrow>
					</md>
					This results in the characteristic equation and general solution:
					<me> ar + b = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = -\frac{b}{a} \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = c e^{-\frac{b}{a}x} </me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, let's apply this method to a couple of examples.
				</p>
				
				<example>
					<p>
						Find the general solution for each LHCC equation.
						<me> 3y' - 9y = 0 \hspace{5em} 5y' = \pi y </me>
					</p>
				
					<solution>
						<p>
							First, rewrite the equations in standard form:
							<me> y' - 3y = 0 \hspace{5em} 5y' - \pi y = 0 </me>
						</p>
						
						<p>
							Now solve the characteristic equations:
							<me> 3r - 9 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 3 \hspace{5em} 5r - \pi = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = \frac{\pi}{5} </me>
							Thus, the general solutions are:
							<me> y = c e^{3x} \hspace{5em} y = c e^{\frac{\pi}{5}x} </me>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
				
				<conclusion>
					<p>
						This straightforward method works for any first-order LHCC equation by using the characteristic equation. In the next sections, we'll extend this technique to higher-order equations.
					</p>

			<subsection><title> 2nd-Order Equations </title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						Now that we've mastered first-order LHCC equations, it's time to explore second-order LHCC equations. These are slightly more complex but follow a similar approach. We'll see how the characteristic equation helps us find solutions and look at the different cases that arise depending on the nature of the roots.
					</p>
				</introduction>

				<p>
					Consider the following second-order equation:
					<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-intro-de"> y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 </men>
					Substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into this equation, we get:
					<md>
						<mrow> \left[e^{rx}\right]'' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right]' + 6 \left[e^{rx}\right] =	\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow> r^2 e^{rx} - 5r e^{rx} + 6 e^{rx} =										\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow> (r^2 - 5r + 6) e^{rx} =													\amp\ 0 \qquad (e^{rx} \ne 0)	</mrow>
						<mrow> \text{characteristic equation} \rightarrow \qquad r^2 - 5r + 6 =			\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow> r_1 = 2, \quad  r_2 =													\amp\ 3							</mrow>
					</md>.
					Therefore, <m>y = e^{2x}</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> are solutions, and the general solution is the combination of these two:
					<me> y = c_1 e^{2x} + c_2 e^{3x} </me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					In general, for any second-order LHCC equation of the form:
					<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-de"> a y'' + b y' + c y = 0 </men>
					The characteristic equation is:
					<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-characteristic-equation"> a r^2 + b r + c = 0 </men>
					This quadratic equation will have two solutions, which could be either real or complex. The general solution depends on the nature of these solutions, and we will now explore the different  cases. Before moving on, we highly recommend taking a minute to review some <xref ref="solving-the-quadratic-equation" text="custom">concepts related to solving quadratic equations</xref>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m> be the solutions to the characteristic equation. When <m>r_1 \ne r_2</m>, the general solution is:
					<men xml:id="second-order-lhcc-solution-r1-notequalto-r2"> y = c_1\, e^{r_1 x} + c_2\, e^{r_2 x} </men>
					However, if <m>r_1 = r_2</m>, the terms combine into like terms,
					<me>
						y = c_1\, e^{r_1 x} + c_2\, e^{r_2 x} = \color{blue}\us{ \large \text{like terms}}{\us{\nwarrow}{\ul{c_1\, e^{r_1 x}}} + \us{\nearrow}{\ul{c_2\, e^{r_1 x}}}} = (\us{C}{\ub{c_1 + c_2}})\, e^{r_1 x}
					</me>,
					which is an incomplete solution. To fix this, we multiply the second term by <m>x</m>, resulting in the correct general solution:
					<fn>
						<p>
							See <xref ref="tba"/> for an outline of why the extra <m>x</m> is required in the general solution of a second order LHCC equation when <m>r_1=r_2</m>.
						</p>
					</fn>
					<me> y = c_1\, e^{r_1 x} + c_2\, x e^{r_1 x} </me>
				</p>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Solving higher-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations is an extension of the methods used for second-order equations. The basic strategy remains the same: solve the characteristic equation, then construct the general solution. However, for higher-order equations, the characteristic equation is a higher-degree polynomial, which can make finding the solutions more challenging.
					</p>
				</introduction>

				<p>
					In general, the characteristic equation will have <m>n</m> roots, which may be real or complex and may also include repeated roots. Each root of the characteristic equation leads to a term in the general solution of the LHCC. Examples in the table below illustrate the process of constructing these general solutions based on the different types of roots.

				<p>
					As the table demonstrates, constructing the general solution of an LHCC equation is systematic once you have the roots of the characteristic equation. However, solving higher-order polynomial equations by hand can be difficult. The next example shows a few algebra techniques you can use to handle higher degree equations.
				</p>

						Solve the following characteristic equations.
						<ol>
							<li> <m> 4 r^2 - 9 = 0 </m> </li>
							<li> <m> r^3 + 3 r^2 - 4 r = 0 </m> </li>
							<li> <m> r^5 + 10 r^4 = 0 </m> </li>
							<li> <m> r^5 - 4 r^3 = 0 </m> </li>
							<li> <m> r^4 - 25 = 0 </m> </li>
							<li> <m> r^4 - 5r^2 + 4 = 0 </m> </li>

					These factoring techniques useful, but they only apply to specific forms of polynomials and it is unlikely that you will be lucky enough to encounter such forms in practice. Therefore, it is reasonable to use technology to aid you with these tyes of problems. Many software tools are available and you are encouraged to use any that you are familiar with.

									Plugging this into to the factoring tool shows that it factors as <m> (r-3)(r-2)(r-1) </m>.	Solving for <m>r</m>, we get

						Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:

					<solution>
						<p>
							The characteristic equation is:
							<me> r^5 - 4r^3 + 3r^2 - 1 = 0 </me>.
							Solving this polynomial equation analytically is challenging, so we use a numerical solver (<url href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=r%5E5-4*r%5E3%2B3*r%5E2-1">Wolfram Alpha</url>). This equation has five roots. Three are real:
							<me> r_1 \approx -2.29, \quad r_2 \approx -0.46, \quad r_3 \approx 1.52, </me>
							and two are complex:
							<me> r_4 \approx 0.61 + 0.5i, \quad r_5 \approx 0.61 - 0.5i </me>.
							The general solution, incorporating these roots, is:
							<md>
								<mrow> y = c_1 e^{-2.29x} + c_2 e^{-0.46x}	+\amp\ c_3 e^{1.52x}								</mrow>
								<mrow> 										+\amp\ e^{0.61x} (c_4 \cos(0.5x) + c_5 \sin(0.5x))	</mrow>

							<me>y = c_1e^{-2.29t} + c_2e^{-0.46t} + c_3e^{1.52t} + e^{0.61t}(c_4\cos(0.5t) + c_5\sin(0.5t))</me>.
