		Discovering an analytical expression, or a formula, for the solution of a differential equation is undoubtedly valuable. However, there are alternative methods of representation that can provide clearer insights and greater accessibility. In this section, we will delve into powerful geometric techniques for illustrating solutions and develop effective methods for visualizing the graphs of these differential equations.
