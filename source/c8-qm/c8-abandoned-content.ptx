		<paragraphs><title> A Slope Field Example </title>
			<p>
				Now let's look at a more complex example. Consider the differential equation
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{y^2}{2} - t.
				</me>
				This equation is autonomous, meaning it only depends on \( y \) and not explicitly on \( t \). We can visualize its slope field by calculating the slopes at various points in the \( (t, y) \)-plane.
			</p>

			<p>
				To generate a slope field for this equation, we can use a computer program to calculate the slopes at a grid of points in the \( (t, y) \)-plane. For example, we might calculate the slopes at points like \( (−3, −3), (−3, −2), ..., (3, 3) \). Each point will have a corresponding slope value given by the function \( f(t, y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - t \).
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure ? shows an example of such a slope field. The arrows indicate the direction of the solution curves at each point in the plane. The length of each arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the slope.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this case, we generated
				<me>
					f(t, y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - t
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				and plotted the slope field for this equation over the region \( −3 ≤ t ≤ 3 \) and \( −3 ≤ y ≤ 3 \) in the \( (t, y) \)-plane. We calculated values of the function \( f(t, y) \) over 25 × 25 points (625 points) in that region.
				We generated the slope field by calculating the slopes at each of these points and drawing small line segments with those slopes centered at each point.
			</p>
			<p>
				A glance at this slope field suggests that the graph of one solution is a line passing through the points \( (−1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \). Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that are below this line seem to increase until they reach an absolute maximum. Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that are above the line seem to increase more and more rapidly.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, in Section ? we will learn an analytic technique for finding solutions of this equation. We will see that the general solution consists of the family of functions
				<me>
					y(t) = t + 1 + c e^t,
				</me>
				where \( c \) is an arbitrary constant. (At this point it is important to emphasize that, even though we have not studied the technique that gives us these solutions, we can still interpret the slope field and understand the behavior of solutions.)
			</p>

				The slope field for this equation over the region <m>−3 ≤ t ≤ 3</m> and <m>−3 ≤ y ≤ 3</m> in the <m>(t, y)</m>-plane is shown in Figure ?. The arrows indicate the direction of the solution curves at each point in the plane, and the length of each arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the slope.

			To get the idea, we'll compare the slope fields for three differential equations:

			<mrow xml:id="slope-de-a"> \amp \text{(A)} \quad \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y}{x} </mrow>

				Match each kind of slope with the way it should look in your drawing:
			</statement>
			<ul>
				<li>Positive slope: Points up and to the right</li>
				<li>Negative slope: Points down and to the left</li>
				<li>Slope of 1 or -1: 45-degree angle</li>

			After calculating your slopes, use colored strips of paper to build a class-wide slope field. Each strip should be centered at the assigned point and tilted to match the slope.

		<paragraphs><title> A Special Case: <m>t</m>-only Dependence </title>
		<p>
			When the first-order differential equation <xref ref="yp-equals-fty"/> lacks <m>y</m> terms, then its form becomes:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t),
			</me>
			where the slopes are determined by just <m>t</m>. We still calculate the slope at <m>(t,y)</m>, but the value of <m>y</m> has no impact on the slope.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this case, the slope generator function <m>f(t)</m> depends only on <m>t</m>, not on <m>y</m>. This means that the slope at any point <m>(t,y)</m> is determined solely by the value of <m>t</m>, and not by the value of <m>y</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Geometrically, this means the slope segment will not change as you move up and down in the <m>y</m> direction. Thus, the slope segment at, say <m>(3, 2)</m>, will be parallel to the slope segment at <m>(3,*)</m> (<m>* = </m> anything). 
		</p>

		<p>
			A nice feature of an equation of the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)
			</me>
			is that it easily solved by direct integration. The solution is simply the integral of the slope generator function:
			<me>
				y(t) = \int f(t) \, dt + C,
			</me>
			where <m>C</m> is a constant of integration.
		</p>

				<me>
			y(t)=\int f(t)\,dt + C.
		</me>

		<p>
			For example, consider the differential equation
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t.
			</me>
			The slope generator function is <m>f(t) = 2t</m>, which only depends on <m>t</m>. The slope field for this equation consists of horizontal line segments with slopes determined by the value of <m>2t</m> at each point. This means that the solution curves are horizontal lines at each t-value.
		</p>

				<p>
			For instance, when <m>dy/dt = 2t</m> the slopes increase linearly with time, and the slope field consists of equal-length, equally-spaced line segments slanting more steeply as you move right.  The analytic solution <m>y=t^2+C</m> is merely the antiderivative of the slope pattern.
