<section><title> Automonomous Equations </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Suppose you're working with a differential equation like
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y).
		</me>

		<p>
			To understand how the solution behaves, you have a few options: you might sketch a slope field, run Euler’s method to estimate values, or—if you’re lucky—find an exact formula by solving the equation. But each of these methods takes work. You’re either crunching numbers or solving integrals.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we focus on a special type of differential equation—one that’s simpler to analyze in a different way. These are equations where the right-hand side doesn’t depend on <m>t</m> at all:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
		</me>

		<p>
			These are called <em>autonomous differential equations</em>. The word "autonomous" means "self-governing." That fits, because the behavior of these equations is governed entirely by the current value of <m>y</m>. No external timeline is needed. Because of this structure, we can use powerful visual tools to understand their solutions—tools that don’t require much calculation at all.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection><title>Autonomous Equations</title>
		<p>
			An <em>autonomous equation</em> is a differential equation where the rate of change depends only on the dependent variable:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
		</me>

		<p>
			That is, <m>dy/dt</m> is determined entirely by the value of <m>y</m>—it doesn’t matter what time <m>t</m> it is. This form shows up often in real-world models. Why?
		</p>

		<p>
			First, many physical systems behave the same way no matter when you observe them. A compressed spring gives the same force whether it’s morning or afternoon. Second, some time-dependent behavior smooths out over long periods. For example, wolves might eat more field mice during the day than at night, but if we’re studying population changes over years, we can average out those daily cycles.
		</p>

		<p>
			Autonomous equations have a special kind of slope field. Because <m>f(y)</m> doesn’t depend on <m>t</m>, the slope is the same along any horizontal line. That means the tiny direction segments in the slope field are identical at all points with the same <m>y</m>-value, even if their <m>t</m>-values are different (see Figure 1.51).
		</p>

		<p>
			This creates a lot of repetition in the slope field. If we know the slope at every height <m>y</m> along a single vertical line (say, <m>t = t_0</m>), then we know the slope everywhere in the <m>t</m><m>y</m>-plane! That’s why we introduce a simplified tool: the <em>phase line</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The phase line shows all the important information from the slope field, but compressed into a single vertical diagram. It helps us quickly understand where solutions rise or fall and where they stay constant. You’ll see it’s a powerful tool for analyzing autonomous equations without doing much calculation.

    <subsection><title> Riding the Wind Analogy </title>

    <p>
        Suppose you're given an autonomous differential equation:
    </p>

    <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
    </me>

    <p>
        To visualize this, imagine a vertical wind tunnel extending infinitely far up and down. Each height <m>y</m> in the tunnel corresponds to a position on the <m>y</m>-axis. At every point in the tunnel, a fan generates wind that blows either upward or downward with a velocity determined by the function <m>f(y)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now suppose you are placed inside the tunnel at height <m>y_0</m> at time <m>t = 0</m>. You are given one instruction: allow the wind to carry you. If <m>f(y)</m> is positive at your current height, the wind pushes you upward; if it's negative, you are pushed downward. A large value of <m>|f(y)|</m> means a strong gust, while values close to zero mean a gentle drift.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you move, the wind speed changes—because the velocity depends on your current height. At any moment, your velocity is always equal to <m>f(y)</m>. This determines your position function <m>y(t)</m>, which satisfies:
    </p>

    <me>
        \frac{dy}{dt} = f(y), \quad y(0) = y_0.
    </me>

    <p>
        The phase line is a diagram that summarizes the essential behavior of this wind tunnel. Rather than recording the exact value of <m>f(y)</m> at every height, the phase line marks the locations where <m>f(y) = 0</m>—the points where the wind stops. On intervals between these equilibrium points, we use arrows to indicate the direction of motion: upward when <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> and downward when <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This simplified picture helps us understand the qualitative behavior of solutions: where they speed up or slow down, where they settle, and whether they approach or move away from equilibrium points.

	<subsection><title> Equilibrium Solutions and Stability </title>
		<p>
        An <term>equilibrium solution</term> is a constant solution — one where <m>y(x) = c</m> for all <m>x</m>. This happens when the derivative is zero: <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = 0</m>. For an autonomous DE like <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)</m>, we find equilibrium values by solving <m>f(y) = 0</m>.
        </p>

        <exercise><title>Equilibrium of <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2</m></title>
        <statement>
            Does <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2</m> have any equilibrium solutions? Justify your answer.

        <p>
        Now try it on a more interesting DE:
        </p>

        <me>
        \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4
        </me>

        <exercise><title>Long-Term Behavior</title>
        <statement>
            Based on the slope field for <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4</m>, describe the long-term behavior of solutions for different starting values of <m>y(0)</m>.
        </statement>
        <free-response>
            <p><em>Example:</em> What happens when <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>? What about when <m>y(0) = 1</m> or <m>y(0) = 2</m>?</p>
