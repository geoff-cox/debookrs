			Understanding the long-term behavior of solutions to differential equations is crucial in many fields, from physics to biology. In this section, we will explore how to analyze the stability of equilibrium points and classify their behavior using geometric methods.

		<p>
			We will introduce the concept of a <em>phase line</em>, which provides a visual representation of how solutions behave over time. By examining the direction of arrows on this line, we can determine whether solutions approach or move away from equilibrium points.

		<p>
			This approach allows us to classify equilibrium points as sinks, sources, or nodes, and understand their influence on nearby solutions. We will also learn how to apply the Linearization Theorem to quickly assess stability without needing explicit solutions.

			<p>
				Equilibrium points are key to understanding the behavior of autonomous differential equations. These are the values of <m>y</m> where <m>dy/dt = 0</m>—in other words, where the solution stays constant over time. But not all equilibrium points behave the same way. To better understand their role, we classify them based on how nearby solutions behave.
			</p>

			<p>
				Imagine an equilibrium point at <m>y = y_0</m>. What happens to a solution that starts just a little below or above <m>y_0</m>? If the arrows on the phase line point <em>toward</em> <m>y_0</m> from both sides, then nearby solutions approach <m>y_0</m> as <m>t</m> increases. We call this kind of equilibrium point a <em>sink</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The term "sink" is meant to help you visualize solutions being drawn inward—like water draining toward a sink. If you start close enough to the equilibrium, you'll end up being pulled into it over time.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now consider a different situation. Suppose the arrows point <em>away</em> from <m>y_0</m> on both sides. Then any solution that starts near <m>y_0</m> moves away from it as time increases. In this case, <m>y_0</m> is called a <em>source</em>, because nearby solutions are pushed outward—like water being sprayed away from a fountain.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sinks and sources are the two most important types of equilibrium points. But not every equilibrium behaves like these. If solutions approach from one side and move away on the other, then <m>y_0</m> is neither a sink nor a source. We call such points <em>nodes</em>. Nodes are still equilibrium points, but they have a more complicated influence on nearby solutions (see Figure).
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's look at an example. Consider the differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 + y - 6 = (y + 3)(y - 2).
			</me>

			<p>
				The equilibrium points are <m>y = -3</m> and <m>y = 2</m>. To classify them, we analyze the sign of <m>dy/dt</m>:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>When <m>-3 &lt; y &lt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &lt; 0</m>, so solutions decrease.</li>
				<li>When <m>y &lt; -3</m> or <m>y &gt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &gt; 0</m>, so solutions increase.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This tells us that solutions move toward <m>y = -3</m> and away from <m>y = 2</m>. Therefore, <m>y = -3</m> is a sink, and <m>y = 2</m> is a source.
			</p>

			<p>
				What if we don't have a formula for <m>f(y)</m>, but just a graph? We can still sketch the phase line by looking at where <m>f(y)</m> crosses the axis (equilibrium points) and checking where it's positive or negative.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, suppose we're given a graph of <m>g(w)</m> and see that it has equilibrium points at <m>w = -0.5</m>, <m>w = 1</m>, and <m>w = 2.5</m>. From the graph we estimate:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>g(w) &gt; 0</m> when <m>w &lt; -0.5</m>, <m>1 &lt; w &lt; 2.5</m>, and <m>w &gt; 2.5</m></li>
				<li><m>g(w) &lt; 0</m> when <m>-0.5 &lt; w &lt; 1</m></li>
			</ul>

			<example><title>Long-Term Behavior</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Based on the slope field for
						<me>
							\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4
						</me>,
						describe what happens to solutions over time when the initial condition is <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, <m>y(0) = 1</m>, and <m>y(0) = 2</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						To analyze the long-term behavior, we first find the equilibrium points by solving <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives us:
					</p>
					<me>
						y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
					</me>
					<p>
						which has solutions <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y = 1</m>, and <m>y = -1</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now we can sketch the phase line. The sign of <m>f(y)</m> tells us whether solutions increase or decrease:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
						<li><m>-1 &lt; y &lt; 0:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
						<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
						<li><m>y = 1:</m> <m>f(y) = 0</m> → equilibrium point.</li>
						<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						This means:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>If <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, the solution increases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
						<li>If <m>y(0) = 1</m>, it stays at <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
						<li>If <m>y(0) = 2</m>, it decreases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						In summary, all solutions approach the equilibrium point at <em><strong><span style="color:blue">y = 1</span></strong></em> over time, regardless of their starting value. The equilibrium at <m>y = 1</m> is stable, while the others are unstable.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				Using this sign chart, we draw the phase line and determine:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>w = -0.5</m> is a sink (arrows point inward)</li>
				<li><m>w = 1</m> is a source (arrows point outward)</li>
				<li><m>w = 2.5</m> is a node (mixed behavior)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We've seen that we can classify equilibrium points just by looking at the graph of <m>f(y)</m>. In fact, the behavior of solutions near an equilibrium point depends on whether <m>f(y)</m> is increasing or decreasing there.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, suppose <m>f(y)</m> is decreasing near <m>y_0</m>. That means <m>f(y)</m> is positive just to the left of <m>y_0</m> and negative just to the right—so the arrows point inward, and <m>y_0</m> is a sink. Similarly, if <m>f(y)</m> is increasing near <m>y_0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.
			</p>

			<p>
				This idea leads us to a useful result from calculus. If we take the derivative of <m>f(y)</m> at an equilibrium point, it tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing there. This gives us a fast way to classify the equilibrium point.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em>Linearization Theorem.</em> Suppose <m>y_0</m> is an equilibrium point of <m>dy/dt = f(y)</m>, and suppose <m>f(y)</m> is continuously differentiable. Then:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &lt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a sink.</li>
				<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &gt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.</li>
				<li>If <m>f'(y_0) = 0</m>, then the test is inconclusive—we need more information.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This result is part of a broader strategy called <em>linearization</em>. The idea is to approximate a nonlinear equation by a linear one near an equilibrium point. The linear equation is easier to analyze and gives good information about nearby behavior.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's try it on a messy example. Suppose:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = h(y) = y(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
			</me>

			<p>
				Clearly, <m>y = 0</m> is an equilibrium point because <m>h(0) = 0</m>. But the equation is too complicated to analyze directly. So we linearize by computing the derivative:
			</p>

			<me>
				h'(y) = (\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4) + y \cdot \frac{d}{dy}(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
			</me>

			<p>
				Plugging in <m>y = 0</m>, we find <m>h'(0) = \cos(0) = 1</m>. Since <m>h'(0) &gt; 0</m>, the Linearization Theorem tells us that <m>y = 0</m> is a source.
			</p>

			<p>
				But be careful! The result only applies <em>near</em> the equilibrium point. If you start too far away, the linear approximation might not match the behavior of the full nonlinear equation. Still, it's a powerful method: a little bit of calculus gives us a lot of insight.

			<p>
				This creates a lot of repetition in the slope field. If we know the slope at every height <m>y</m> along a single vertical line (say, <m>t = t_0</m>), then we know the slope everywhere in the <m>t</m><m>y</m>-plane! That's why we introduce a simplified tool: the <em>phase line</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The phase line shows all the important information from the slope field, but compressed into a single vertical diagram. It helps us quickly understand where solutions rise or fall and where they stay constant. You'll see it's a powerful tool for analyzing autonomous equations without doing much calculation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Once we've identified the equilibrium points of an autonomous differential equation, we want to understand how nearby solutions behave. One of the most powerful tools for this is a <term>phase line</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				A phase line is a one-dimensional diagram that summarizes how solutions change over time—without needing to draw the full slope field. It consists of a vertical line labeled with equilibrium values of <m>y</m>, along with arrows that show whether the solution increases or decreases at each point.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's the idea: if <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> at a particular <m>y</m>-value, then the solution is increasing there, so we draw an upward arrow. If <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m>, the solution is decreasing, so we draw a downward arrow. At equilibrium points where <m>f(y) = 0</m>, we leave a gap or mark the point with a dot—this is where the solution flattens out.
			</p>

			<p>
				The beauty of a phase line is that it lets you see, at a glance, whether equilibrium points are <em>stable</em> (solutions move toward them), <em>unstable</em> (solutions move away), or something more subtle. You can understand the long-term behavior of all solutions just by following the arrows!
			</p>

			<example>
				<title>Drawing a Phase Line</title>
				<statement>
					Sketch the phase line for the autonomous equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4</m>. Identify all equilibrium points and show where solutions increase or decrease.
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					First, solve <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives:
					</p>

					<me>
					y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
					</me>

					<p>
					which has solutions <m>y = -1</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, and <m>y = 1</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
					Now divide the number line into intervals and test the sign of <m>f(y)</m> in each:
					</p>

					<ul>
					<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>
					<li><m>-1 &lt; y &lt; 0:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → arrow up</li>
					<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → arrow up</li>
					<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Phase line sketch:</p>
					<draw width="300" height="200">
					<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="200" stroke="black"/>
					<text x="160" y="30">y</text>
					<!-- Mark equilibrium points -->
					<circle cx="150" cy="50" r="3" fill="black"/>
					<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="3" fill="black"/>
					<circle cx="150" cy="150" r="3" fill="black"/>
					<text x="130" y="55">1</text>
					<text x="130" y="105">0</text>
					<text x="130" y="155">−1</text>
					<!-- Add directional arrows -->
					<!-- y > 1 -->
					<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="45" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
					<!-- 0 < y < 1 -->
					<line x1="150" y1="55" x2="150" y2="95" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
					<!-- -1 < y < 0 -->
					<line x1="150" y1="105" x2="150" y2="145" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
					<!-- y < -1 -->
					<line x1="150" y1="155" x2="150" y2="195" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
					</draw>

					<p>
					From this diagram, we see:
					</p>

					<ul>
					<li><m>y = -1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
					<li><m>y = 0</m> is unstable (source)</li>
					<li><m>y = 1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
					So, solutions starting near <m>y = 0</m> move away from it. Solutions starting between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> move toward <m>y = 1</m>, and so on. The phase line gives a complete picture of how the system behaves in the long run—without drawing any solution curves!
