			Discovering an analytical expression, or a formula, for the solution of a differential equation is undoubtedly valuable. However, there are alternative methods of representation that can provide clearer insights and greater accessibility. In this section, we will delve into powerful geometric techniques for illustrating solutions and develop effective methods for visualizing the graphs of these differential equations.

	<section><title> Slope Fields </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
			Many differential equations have no explicit formula for their solutions. Even when they do, those formulas can be messy or hard to interpret. Fortunately, there's another way to understand what solutions look like — without ever solving the equation. This method is called a <term>slope field</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
			A slope field is a visual representation of the slopes that a solution curve must follow at each point in the plane. It's like a map of tiny arrows (or line segments) that show the direction a solution would travel through each point. The pattern formed by these segments gives us a picture of the <em>family of solutions</em> to the differential equation.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<paragraphs><title> The Slope Generator </title>
			<p>
				By definition, first order differential equations contain a derivative, which can be isolated on one side of the equation. As a result, many first order differential equations can be written in the form:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="slope-machine-eqn1">
				y'(t) = f(t, y)
			</men>

			<p>
				where <m>f(t, y)</m> is some expression containing only <m>t</m> and <m>y</m> variables. So, if we plug, say <m>t=3</m> and <m>y=-5</m> into the equation we get
			</p>

			<me>
				y'(3) = f(3, -5) = \text{some number}.
			</me>

			<p>
				From calculus, you know that <m>y'(3)</m> gives the slope of the tangent line of <m>y</m> at <m>t=3</m>. Therefore, any equation of the form <xref ref="slope-machine-eqn1"/> can be thought of as a <em>slope generator</em> that computes the slope of the solution at any point <m>(t, y)</m>.
			</p>

			<example><title> Finding the Slope </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Given the first-order differential equation
						<me>
							y'(t) - ty(t) = 2 - t^2,
						</me>
						compute the slope of the tangent line of the solution, <m>y(t)</m>, at the point <m>(-1, 6)</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						To find the slope of the solution at the point <m>(-1, 6)</m>, we first isolate <m>y'(t)</m>:
					</p>

					<me>
						y'(t) = ty(t) + 2 - t^2.
					</me>

					<p>
						This shows that the slope generator function is:
						<me>f(t, y) = ty + 2 - t^2</me>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now we can plug in the values <m>t = -1</m> and <m>y(-1) = 6</m> into the slope generator:
					</p>
					<me>
						y'(-1) = f(-1, 6) = (-1)(6) + 2 - (-1)^2
						= -6 + 2 - 1 = -5.
					</me>
					<p>
						So the slope of the solution curve at the point <m>(-1, 6)</m> is <m>-5</m>.
					</p>
				</solution>

		<paragraphs><title> Visualizing Solutions with Slopes  </title>
			<p>
				Thinking of a first-order differential equation as a slope generator gives us a powerful way to visualize its solutions. Consider the general form:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y).
			</me>

			<p>
				Using the function <m>f(t, y)</m>, we can construct a slope field. This involves selecting various points in the <m>(t, y)</m>-plane and computing the value of <m>f(t, y)</m> at each one. At each point, we draw a short line segment (a "tangent segment") with that slope. These tangential segment collectively form a picture that reveals the behavior of the solution curves (see Figure ?).
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider the differential equation
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = y - t.
			</me>

			<p>
				Here, the slope generator is the function:
			</p>

			<me>
				f(t, y) = y - t.
			</me>

			<p>
				To practice constructing a slope field, we begin by computing <m>f(t, y)</m> at nine selected points in the <m>(t, y)</m>-plane. For instance, at the point <m>(1, -1)</m>, we find:
			</p>

			<me>
				f(1, -1) = -1 - 1 = -2.
			</me>

			<p>
				So we draw a short segment with slope <m>-2</m> centered at <m>(1, -1)</m>. The table below shows the slope values at the selected points:
			</p>

			<table>
				<tabular>
				<row><cell>Point (t, y)</cell> <cell>Slope f(t, y)</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(−1, −1)</cell> <cell>0</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(−1, 0)</cell>  <cell>1</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(−1, 1)</cell>  <cell>2</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(0, −1)</cell>  <cell>1</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(0, 0)</cell>   <cell>0</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(0, 1)</cell>   <cell>−1</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(1, −1)</cell>  <cell>−2</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(1, 0)</cell>   <cell>−1</cell></row>
				<row><cell>(1, 1)</cell>   <cell>0</cell></row>
				</tabular>
			</table>

			<p>
				Once we've calculated these slopes, we sketch short line segments with those slopes at each point. These segments should be short enough not to overlap but long enough to be clearly visible.
			</p>

			<p>
				While hand-sketching slope fields helps build intuition, it becomes tedious with more points. A computer-generated slope field provides a more complete picture. For instance, a computer can generate the slope field for <m>f(t, y) = y - t</m> by calculating slopes on a grid and drawing corresponding tangent segments.
			</p>
		</paragraphs>

		<paragraphs><title> A Special Case: <m>t</m>-only Dependence </title>
			<p>
				If the right-hand side of the differential equation in question is solely a function of t, or in other words, if dy/dt = f (t), the slope only affected by the value of <m>t</m> (see Figure ?). In other words, if we change the value of <m>t</m>, the slope will change, but if we change the value of <m>y</m>, the slope will not change.
			</p>

			<p>
				Geometrically, this means the slope segment will not change as you move up and down in the <m>y</m> direction. Thus, the slope segment at, say <m>(3, 2)</m>, will be parallel to the slope segment at <m>(3,*)</m> (<m>* = </m> anything). 
			</p>

			<p>
				A nice feature of an equation of the form
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)
				</me>
				is that it easily solved by direct integration. The solution is simply the integral of the slope generator function:
				<me>
					y(t) = \int f(t) \, dt + C,
				</me>
				where <m>C</m> is a constant of integration.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider the differential equation
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t.
				</me>
				The slope generator function is <m>f(t) = 2t</m>, which only depends on <m>t</m>. The slope field for this equation consists of horizontal line segments with slopes determined by the value of <m>2t</m> at each point. This means that the solution curves are horizontal lines at each t-value.

	<section><title> Automonomous Equations </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Suppose you're working with a differential equation like
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y).
			</me>

			<p>
				To understand how the solution behaves, you have a few options: you might sketch a slope field, run Euler's method to estimate values, or—if you're lucky—find an exact formula by solving the equation. But each of these methods takes work. You're either crunching numbers or solving integrals.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we focus on a special type of differential equation—one that's simpler to analyze in a different way. These are equations where the right-hand side doesn't depend on <m>t</m> at all. Such equations are called <em>autonomous differential equations</em> and are defined as follows:
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="def-autonomous-eqn"><title> Automonous Differential Equation </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						An <term>autonomous differential equation</term> is a differential equation of the form
						<men xml:id="autonomous-eqn">
							y' = f(y)
						</men>,
						where the change in <m>y</m> is only influenced by <m>y</m> itself.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				The word "autonomous" means "self-governing." That fits, because the behavior of these equations is governed entirely by the current value of <m>y</m>. No external timeline is needed. Because of this structure, we can use powerful visual tools to understand their solutions—tools that don't require much calculation at all.
			</p>

			<p>
				An <em>autonomous equation</em> is a differential equation where the rate of change depends only on the dependent variable:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
			</me>

			<p>
				That is, <m>dy/dt</m> is determined entirely by the value of <m>y</m>—it doesn't matter what time <m>t</m> it is. This form shows up often in real-world models. Why?
			</p>

			<p>
				First, many physical systems behave the same way no matter when you observe them. A compressed spring gives the same force whether it's morning or afternoon. Second, some time-dependent behavior smooths out over long periods. For example, wolves might eat more field mice during the day than at night, but if we're studying population changes over years, we can average out those daily cycles.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> <m>y</m>-only Dependence </title>
			<p>
				Let's take a closer look at a special type of differential equation called an <em>autonomous equation</em>. These are equations where the rate of change of <m>y</m> depends only on <m>y</m> itself—not on time <m>t</m>. In symbols, they look like this:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y).
			</me>

			<p>
				This might seem like a small difference, but it has a big effect on the slope field. Since <m>f(y)</m> doesn't depend on <m>t</m>, the slope at any point in the plane depends only on the height (the <m>y</m>-value), not the horizontal position. That means every point on a horizontal line shares the same slope.
			</p>

			<p>
				In other words, the slope field has a special structure: all the little line segments (slopes) are parallel along each horizontal line. This gives the slope field a kind of “striped” pattern, where the direction of the solution only changes as you move up or down, not side to side (see Figure).
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider this autonomous equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = 4y(1 - y).
			</me>

			<p>
				The slope field for this equation has two important horizontal lines: <m>y = 0</m> and <m>y = 1</m>. Along both lines, the slope is zero, because <m>f(y)</m> equals zero there. That means the solution isn't changing—these are equilibrium solutions. They show up in the slope field as rows of horizontal line segments.
			</p>

			<p>
				What about other values of <m>y</m>? If <m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1</m>, then <m>f(y) = 4y(1 - y)</m> is positive, so the slope is pointing upward, and solutions are increasing. If <m>y &lt; 0</m> or <m>y &gt; 1</m>, then <m>f(y)</m> is negative, and the solutions are decreasing. The slope field shows this clearly: above <m>y = 1</m> and below <m>y = 0</m>, the tiny segments tilt downward.
			</p>

			<p>
				One of the coolest things about autonomous equations is that once you know one solution curve, you can get many more by simply sliding it left or right. That's because the slope field looks the same on every vertical slice—it never changes with <m>t</m>! This symmetry means solutions are horizontally shiftable, and we'll use this idea often in future sections (see Figure).
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> Visualization </title>
			<p>
				Autonomous equations of the form
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)
				</me>
				have a special kind of slope field. Because <m>f(y)</m> doesn't depend on <m>t</m>, the slope is the same along any horizontal line. That means the tiny direction segments in the slope field are identical at all points with the same <m>y</m>-value, even if their <m>t</m>-values are different.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> Slope Fields </title>
				<p>
					To visualize this, we can draw a slope field for an autonomous equation. For example, consider the equation:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 - 4y.
				</me>

				<p>
					The slope at any point <m>(t, y)</m> depends only on <m>y</m>. So we can draw the slope field by calculating slopes at various <m>y</m>-values and then repeating those slopes across all <m>t</m>-values.
				</p>

				<p>
					This gives us a slope field that looks like this:
				</p>

				<draw width="300" height="200">
					<!-- Draw axes -->
					<line x1="0" y1="100" x2="300" y2="100" stroke="black"/>
					<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="200" stroke="black"/>
					<!-- Add labels -->
					<text x="160" y="30">t</text>
					<text x="130" y="190">y</text>
					<!-- Draw slope segments -->
					<!-- Example slopes at y = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 -->
					<line x1="50" y1="100" x2="70" y2="80" stroke="blue"/> <!-- t=0, y=0 -->
					<line x1="50" y1="80" x2="70" y2="60" stroke="blue"/> <!-- t=0, y=1 -->
					<line x1="50" y1="60" x2="70" y2="40" stroke="blue"/> <!-- t=0, y=2 -->
					<line x1="50" y1="40" x2="70" y2="20" stroke="blue"/> <!-- t=0, y=3 -->
					<line x1="50" y1="20" x2="70" y2="-10" stroke="blue"/> <!-- t=0, y=4 -->
				</draw>

				<p>
					This shows how the slope changes with <m>y </m>. For example, at <m>y = 0</m>, the slope is <m>-4</m>, so we draw a downward segment. At <m>y = 2</m>, the slope is <m>0</m>, so we draw a flat segment. At <m>y = 4</m>, the slope is <m>4</m>, so we draw an upward segment. 
					We repeat these slopes across all <m>t</m>-values, creating a pattern that shows how solutions behave over time.

		<subsection><title> Equilibrium Solutions </title>
			<p>
				Like all differential equations, <xref ref="def-autonomous-eqn" text="custom">autonomous differential equations</xref> have a family of solutions. However, these equations have a special set of constant solutions in the family that are both easy to find and tell us important information about the long-term behavior of all the other solutions in the family. Such solutions are called <term>equilibrium solutions</term> and have the form <m>y(t) = c</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant.
			</p>

			<p>
				A single equation can have multiple equilibrium solutions and we find them by plugging <m>y(t) = c</m> into the <xref ref="def-autonomous-eqn" text="custom">autonomous equation</xref>, giving us
			</p>

			<me>
				y'(t) = f(y(t)) \quad\implies\quad [c]' = f(c) \quad\implies\quad f(c) = 0,
			</me>

			<p>
				where the resulting equation, <m>f(c) = 0</m>, is an algebra equation that is solved for <m>c</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, plugging <m>y(t) = c</m> into the autonomous equation
				<me>
					y' = 1-y^2
				</me>,
				gives us
				<me>
					0 = 1 - c^2 \quad\implies\quad c^2 = 1 \quad\implies\quad c = \pm 1.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				So, the equilibrium solutions for this equation are <m>y(t) = 1</m> and <m>y(t) = -1</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				It is important to emphasize that although we found <m>y</m> as if it were a number, the equilibrium solutions are actually constant functions, defined for all <m>t</m>. Graphing these solutions, would display two horizontal lines crossing at <m>y = 1</m> and <m>y = -1</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For an autonomous equation like <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)</m>, we find these constant solutions by solving <m>f(y) = 0</m>. That gives us the values of <m>y</m> where the slope is zero—where the solution graph is perfectly flat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now let's try a slightly more interesting differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4.
			</me>

			<p>
				This equation has multiple equilibrium points and reveals a rich variety of behavior depending on the starting value of <m>y(0)</m>. We'll use slope fields and phase lines to explore how solutions evolve over time.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Understanding the long-term behavior of solutions to differential equations is crucial in many fields, from physics to biology. In this section, we will explore how to analyze the stability of equilibrium points and classify their behavior using geometric methods.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will introduce the concept of a <em>phase line</em>, which provides a visual representation of how solutions behave over time. By examining the direction of arrows on this line, we can determine whether solutions approach or move away from equilibrium points.
			</p>

			<p>
				This approach allows us to classify equilibrium points as sinks, sources, or nodes, and understand their influence on nearby solutions. We will also learn how to apply the Linearization Theorem to quickly assess stability without needing explicit solutions.
			</p>

			<p>
				By the end of this section, you will have a powerful set of tools for analyzing the stability and long-term behavior of solutions to autonomous differential equations.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> Long-Term Behavior and Phase Lines </title>
			<paragraphs><title> Long-Term Behavior </title>
				<p>
					Equilibrium points are key to understanding the behavior of autonomous differential equations. These are the values of <m>y</m> where <m>dy/dt = 0</m>—in other words, where the solution stays constant over time. But not all equilibrium points behave the same way. To better understand their role, we classify them based on how nearby solutions behave.
				</p>

				<p>
					Imagine an equilibrium point at <m>y = y_0</m>. What happens to a solution that starts just a little below or above <m>y_0</m>? If the arrows on the phase line point <em>toward</em> <m>y_0</m> from both sides, then nearby solutions approach <m>y_0</m> as <m>t</m> increases. We call this kind of equilibrium point a <em>sink</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The term "sink" is meant to help you visualize solutions being drawn inward—like water draining toward a sink. If you start close enough to the equilibrium, you'll end up being pulled into it over time.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now consider a different situation. Suppose the arrows point <em>away</em> from <m>y_0</m> on both sides. Then any solution that starts near <m>y_0</m> moves away from it as time increases. In this case, <m>y_0</m> is called a <em>source</em>, because nearby solutions are pushed outward—like water being sprayed away from a fountain.
				</p>

				<p>
					Sinks and sources are the two most important types of equilibrium points. But not every equilibrium behaves like these. If solutions approach from one side and move away on the other, then <m>y_0</m> is neither a sink nor a source. We call such points <em>nodes</em>. Nodes are still equilibrium points, but they have a more complicated influence on nearby solutions (see Figure).
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's look at an example. Consider the differential equation:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 + y - 6 = (y + 3)(y - 2).
				</me>

				<p>
					The equilibrium points are <m>y = -3</m> and <m>y = 2</m>. To classify them, we analyze the sign of <m>dy/dt</m>:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>When <m>-3 &lt; y &lt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &lt; 0</m>, so solutions decrease.</li>
					<li>When <m>y &lt; -3</m> or <m>y &gt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &gt; 0</m>, so solutions increase.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This tells us that solutions move toward <m>y = -3</m> and away from <m>y = 2</m>. Therefore, <m>y = -3</m> is a sink, and <m>y = 2</m> is a source.
				</p>

				<p>
					What if we don't have a formula for <m>f(y)</m>, but just a graph? We can still sketch the phase line by looking at where <m>f(y)</m> crosses the axis (equilibrium points) and checking where it's positive or negative.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, suppose we're given a graph of <m>g(w)</m> and see that it has equilibrium points at <m>w = -0.5</m>, <m>w = 1</m>, and <m>w = 2.5</m>. From the graph we estimate:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><m>g(w) &gt; 0</m> when <m>w &lt; -0.5</m>, <m>1 &lt; w &lt; 2.5</m>, and <m>w &gt; 2.5</m></li>
					<li><m>g(w) &lt; 0</m> when <m>-0.5 &lt; w &lt; 1</m></li>
				</ul>

							</me>,
							describe what happens to solutions over time when the initial condition is <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, <m>y(0) = 1</m>, and <m>y(0) = 2</m>.
						</p>
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
							To analyze the long-term behavior, we first find the equilibrium points by solving <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives us:
						</p>
						<me>
							y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
						</me>
						<p>
							which has solutions <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y = 1</m>, and <m>y = -1</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Now we can sketch the phase line. The sign of <m>f(y)</m> tells us whether solutions increase or decrease:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
							<li><m>-1 &lt; y &lt; 0:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
							<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
							<li><m>y = 1:</m> <m>f(y) = 0</m> → equilibrium point.</li>
							<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							This means:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>If <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, the solution increases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
							<li>If <m>y(0) = 1</m>, it stays at <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
							<li>If <m>y(0) = 2</m>, it decreases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							In summary, all solutions approach the equilibrium point at <em><strong><span style="color:blue">y = 1</span></strong></em> over time, regardless of their starting value. The equilibrium at <m>y = 1</m> is stable, while the others are unstable.

				</example>

				<p>
					Using this sign chart, we draw the phase line and determine:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li><m>w = -0.5</m> is a sink (arrows point inward)</li>
					<li><m>w = 1</m> is a source (arrows point outward)</li>
					<li><m>w = 2.5</m> is a node (mixed behavior)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					We've seen that we can classify equilibrium points just by looking at the graph of <m>f(y)</m>. In fact, the behavior of solutions near an equilibrium point depends on whether <m>f(y)</m> is increasing or decreasing there.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, suppose <m>f(y)</m> is decreasing near <m>y_0</m>. That means <m>f(y)</m> is positive just to the left of <m>y_0</m> and negative just to the right—so the arrows point inward, and <m>y_0</m> is a sink. Similarly, if <m>f(y)</m> is increasing near <m>y_0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.
				</p>

				<p>
					This idea leads us to a useful result from calculus. If we take the derivative of <m>f(y)</m> at an equilibrium point, it tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing there. This gives us a fast way to classify the equilibrium point.
				</p>

				<p>
					<em>Linearization Theorem.</em> Suppose <m>y_0</m> is an equilibrium point of <m>dy/dt = f(y)</m>, and suppose <m>f(y)</m> is continuously differentiable. Then:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &lt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a sink.</li>
					<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &gt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.</li>
					<li>If <m>f'(y_0) = 0</m>, then the test is inconclusive—we need more information.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This result is part of a broader strategy called <em>linearization</em>. The idea is to approximate a nonlinear equation by a linear one near an equilibrium point. The linear equation is easier to analyze and gives good information about nearby behavior.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's try it on a messy example. Suppose:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = h(y) = y(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
				</me>

				<p>
					Clearly, <m>y = 0</m> is an equilibrium point because <m>h(0) = 0</m>. But the equation is too complicated to analyze directly. So we linearize by computing the derivative:
				</p>

				<me>
					h'(y) = (\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4) + y \cdot \frac{d}{dy}(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
				</me>

				<p>
					Plugging in <m>y = 0</m>, we find <m>h'(0) = \cos(0) = 1</m>. Since <m>h'(0) &gt; 0</m>, the Linearization Theorem tells us that <m>y = 0</m> is a source.
				</p>

				<p>
					But be careful! The result only applies <em>near</em> the equilibrium point. If you start too far away, the linear approximation might not match the behavior of the full nonlinear equation. Still, it's a powerful method: a little bit of calculus gives us a lot of insight.
				</p>

			<paragraphs><title> Phase Lines </title>
				<p>
					This creates a lot of repetition in the slope field. If we know the slope at every height <m>y</m> along a single vertical line (say, <m>t = t_0</m>), then we know the slope everywhere in the <m>t</m><m>y</m>-plane! That's why we introduce a simplified tool: the <em>phase line</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The phase line shows all the important information from the slope field, but compressed into a single vertical diagram. It helps us quickly understand where solutions rise or fall and where they stay constant. You'll see it's a powerful tool for analyzing autonomous equations without doing much calculation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once we've identified the equilibrium points of an autonomous differential equation, we want to understand how nearby solutions behave. One of the most powerful tools for this is a <term>phase line</term>.
				</p>

				<p>
					A phase line is a one-dimensional diagram that summarizes how solutions change over time—without needing to draw the full slope field. It consists of a vertical line labeled with equilibrium values of <m>y</m>, along with arrows that show whether the solution increases or decreases at each point.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here's the idea: if <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> at a particular <m>y</m>-value, then the solution is increasing there, so we draw an upward arrow. If <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m>, the solution is decreasing, so we draw a downward arrow. At equilibrium points where <m>f(y) = 0</m>, we leave a gap or mark the point with a dot—this is where the solution flattens out.
				</p>

				<p>
					The beauty of a phase line is that it lets you see, at a glance, whether equilibrium points are <em>stable</em> (solutions move toward them), <em>unstable</em> (solutions move away), or something more subtle. You can understand the long-term behavior of all solutions just by following the arrows!
				</p>

				<example>
					<title>Drawing a Phase Line</title>
					<statement>
						Sketch the phase line for the autonomous equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4</m>. Identify all equilibrium points and show where solutions increase or decrease.
					</statement>
					<solution>
						<p>
						First, solve <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives:
						</p>

						<me>
						y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
						</me>

						<p>
						which has solutions <m>y = -1</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, and <m>y = 1</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
						Now divide the number line into intervals and test the sign of <m>f(y)</m> in each:
						</p>

						<ul>
						<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>
						<li><m>-1 &lt; y &lt; 0:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → arrow up</li>
						<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → arrow up</li>
						<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Phase line sketch:</p>
						<draw width="300" height="200">
						<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="200" stroke="black"/>
						<text x="160" y="30">y</text>
						<!-- Mark equilibrium points -->
						<circle cx="150" cy="50" r="3" fill="black"/>
						<circle cx="150" cy="100" r="3" fill="black"/>
						<circle cx="150" cy="150" r="3" fill="black"/>
						<text x="130" y="55">1</text>
						<text x="130" y="105">0</text>
						<text x="130" y="155">−1</text>
						<!-- Add directional arrows -->
						<!-- y > 1 -->
						<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="45" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
						<!-- 0 < y < 1 -->
						<line x1="150" y1="55" x2="150" y2="95" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
						<!-- -1 < y < 0 -->
						<line x1="150" y1="105" x2="150" y2="145" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
						<!-- y < -1 -->
						<line x1="150" y1="155" x2="150" y2="195" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
						</draw>

						<p>
						From this diagram, we see:
						</p>

						<ul>
						<li><m>y = -1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
						<li><m>y = 0</m> is unstable (source)</li>
						<li><m>y = 1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
						So, solutions starting near <m>y = 0</m> move away from it. Solutions starting between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> move toward <m>y = 1</m>, and so on. The phase line gives a complete picture of how the system behaves in the long run—without drawing any solution curves!

		<subsection><title> The Logistic Model </title>
			<p>
				One of the most famous autonomous differential equations is the <em>logistic model</em>, which describes population growth when there are limited resources. The equation is:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right),
			</me>

			<p>
				where <m>P</m> is the population at time <m>t</m>, <m>r</m> is the growth rate, and <m>K</m> is the <em>carrying capacity</em>—the maximum population that the environment can sustain.
			</p>

			<p>
				This equation has two equilibrium points:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>P = 0</m> (extinction),</li>
				<li><m>P = K</m> (population stabilizes at carrying capacity).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The phase line for this model shows:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>At <m>P = 0</m>, the equilibrium is unstable—any small population increase leads to growth.</li>
				<li>At <m>P = K</m>, the equilibrium is stable—populations near this value settle toward it.</li>
				<li>When <m>0 &lt; P &lt; K</m>, populations increase.</li>
				<li>When <m>P &gt; K</m>, populations decrease.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This model captures how populations grow rapidly when small, slow down as they approach the carrying capacity, and eventually level off.
			</p>

			<example>
				<title>Logistic Model Analysis</title>
				<statement>
				Consider the logistic equation <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)</m>.
				<ul>
					<li>Identify the equilibrium points.</li>
					<li>Sketch the phase line and classify the stability of each equilibrium.</li>
					<li>Explain how this model describes long-term population behavior.</li>
				</ul>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>The equilibrium points are <m>P = 0</m> and <m>P = K</m>.</p>
				<p>On the phase line:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><m>P = 0</m> is a source (unstable).</li>
					<li><m>P = K</m> is a sink (stable).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Populations grow when between <m>0</m> and <m>K</m>, and shrink when above <m>K</m>. The model predicts eventual stabilization at the carrying capacity.
				</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				The logistic model is sometimes written in a slightly different form:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dP}{dt} = kP\left(1 - \frac{P}{N}\right),
			</me>

			<p>
				where <m>N</m> is the carrying capacity and <m>k</m> is the growth-rate constant. This form emphasizes that growth is proportional to both the current population and the remaining resource capacity <m>(1 - P/N)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				This is still a first-order autonomous differential equation, but unlike the exponential model, it is nonlinear since the right-hand side is not a linear function of <m>P</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The analysis is the same: the equilibria are <m>P = 0</m> and <m>P = N</m>. The phase line tells us their stability, just like before.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> A Modified Logistic Model </title>
			<p>
				Let's now consider a variation on the logistic model that includes an important ecological detail—what happens to very small populations. The standard logistic model assumes that populations always grow when small, but in reality, sparse populations can have difficulty finding mates, making growth <em>negative</em> at low levels.
			</p>

			<p>
				As an example, consider pine squirrels in the Rocky Mountains. These animals are territorial, and both overcrowding and underpopulation can limit their growth:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If the population is too <em>large</em>, territorial conflict slows growth or even causes decline.</li>
				<li>If the population is too <em>small</em>, individuals may not find mates, also resulting in decline.</li>
				<li>If the population is exactly zero, it stays at zero forever.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Let's model this situation. We define:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>t</m> = time,</li>
				<li><m>S(t)</m> = squirrel population at time <m>t</m>,</li>
				<li><m>k</m> = growth-rate coefficient,</li>
				<li><m>N</m> = carrying capacity (too large),</li>
				<li><m>M</m> = sparsity threshold (too small).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				We want the growth rate <m>g(S)</m> to satisfy the following:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>g(S) &lt; 0</m> if <m>S &lt; M</m> or <m>S &gt; N</m>,</li>
				<li><m>g(S) &gt; 0</m> if <m>M &lt; S &lt; N</m>,</li>
				<li><m>g(0) = 0</m>.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				A function with this behavior might look like:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dS}{dt} = kS\left(1 - \frac{S}{N}\right)\left(\frac{S}{M} - 1\right).
			</me>

			<p>
				This is the <em>modified logistic model</em>. It adjusts the standard model to account for low-population risks.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's analyze it. The equilibrium points occur where the right-hand side equals zero:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>S = 0</m> (extinction),</li>
				<li><m>S = M</m> (sparsity threshold),</li>
				<li><m>S = N</m> (carrying capacity).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The phase line tells us:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><m>S = 0</m> is a stable equilibrium (a sink).</li>
				<li><m>S = M</m> is an unstable equilibrium (a source).</li>
				<li><m>S = N</m> is a stable equilibrium (a sink).</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				This model better captures real-world behavior by showing that small populations might go extinct if they fall below the sparsity threshold.
			</p>

			<exercise>
				<title>Modified Logistic Model Analysis</title>
				<statement>
				Consider the differential equation:
				<me>
					\frac{dS}{dt} = kS\left(1 - \frac{S}{N}\right)\left(\frac{S}{M} - 1\right).
				</me>
				<ul>
					<li>Find all equilibrium solutions.</li>
					<li>Sketch the phase line and label the stability of each equilibrium.</li>
					<li>Explain how this model improves on the standard logistic model.</li>
				</ul>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>Equilibrium points: <m>S = 0</m>, <m>S = M</m>, <m>S = N</m>.</p>
				<p>Phase line summary:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><m>S = 0</m> is a sink (stable).</li>
					<li><m>S = M</m> is a source (unstable).</li>
					<li><m>S = N</m> is a sink (stable).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Between <m>0</m> and <m>M</m>, populations decrease. Between <m>M</m> and <m>N</m>, populations increase. Above <m>N</m>, populations decrease. This reflects the idea that populations only grow when they're within a “safe” range—not too small and not too large.
