<section><title> Slope Fields </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Very few differential equations come with neat, closed-form solutions. Fortunately, we can still understand what those solutions look like by focusing on <em>how</em> they change instead of <em>what</em> they equal. A <term>slope field</term> turns the right-hand side of a first-order equation into a picture that every solution curve must follow.
		</p>

		<p>
			A slope field is a visual representation of the slopes that a solution curve must follow at each point in the plane. It's like a map of tiny arrows (or line segments) that show the direction a solution would travel through each point. The pattern formed by these segments gives us a picture of the <em>family of solutions</em> to the differential equation.

	<paragraphs><title> From Equation to Slope </title>
		<p>
			Since every first order differential equation consists of some arrangement of <m>t</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>y'</m>, we can move everything to one side of the equation and represent the equation as:
			<me>
				f(t, y, y') = 0,
			</me>
			where <m>f</m> is a single function containing everything we moved over. Here is an example of such a rearrangement:
			<me>
				y' - ty = 2 - t^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad
				\ub{y' - ty - 2 + t^2}_{\large f(t, y, y')} = 0.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			When it is possible to put just <m>y'</m> on one side and everything else on the other, we write:
			<men xml:id="yp-equals-fty">
				y' = f(t, y).
			</men>
		</p>

		<p>
			Equations of this form have a very special property since we can think of the function <m>f(t,y)</m> as a function that takes two variables, <m>t</m> and <m>y</m>, and returns a single number. For example, when <m> t = 3 </m> and <m> y = 5 </m>,
			<me>
				y'(3) = f(3, 5) = \text{some number}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Calculus teaches you that <m>y'(3)</m> is the slope of the tangent line of <m>y</m> at <m>t=3</m>. So this number gives the exact direction the graph of <m>y</m> is moving when it passes through <m>(3,5)</m>.
		</p>

		<example><title> Quick Slope Check </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					For
					<me>
						y' - ty = 2 - t^2,
					</me>
					find the slope at <m>(t,y)=(-1,6)</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Rearranging gives <me>y' = ty + 2 - t^2</me>, so <m>f(t,y)=ty+2-t^2</m>.  Substitute:
				</p>
				<me>
					f(-1,6) = (-1)(6)+2-(-1)^2 = -5.
				</me>
				<p>
					Any solution that passes through <m>(-1,6)</m> leaves that point with slope <m>-5</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Here, <m>f(t,y)</m> acts as a <em>slope generator</em> that takes in a <m>(t, y)</m> point in the <m>ty</m>-plane and outputs the slope of the solution, <m>y(t)</m>, as it passes through this point.

			To draw a slope field by hand:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Choose a small grid of points in the <m>(t,y)</m>-plane.</li>
			<li>Compute <m>f(t,y)</m> at each point.</li>
			<li>Draw a short line segment centered at the point with that slope.</li>
		</ol>

			While hand-sketching slope fields helps build intuition, it becomes tedious with more points. A computer-generated slope field provides a more complete picture. For instance, <xref ref="y-t-slope-field-16x16"/> shows a <m>16\times16</m> slope field for the same equation. It also includes the solution curve that passess through the point <m>(0, \frac12)</m>. Notice how the curve follows the general tend of the slopes, as if it was the path of an object driven by a current.

	<conclusion><title> Wrap-Up </title>
		<p>
			A slope field turns a differential equation into a navigational chart: the arrows are the instructions every solution must obey.  By reading that chart you can predict qualitative behavior—growth, decay, equilibria, long-term trends—without ever writing down an explicit formula.  In the next section we focus on autonomous equations, whose slope fields have an extra layer of symmetry.
