		<p>
			As you saw in the previous discussion, slope fields of autonomous differential equations have a special property where the slope is the same as independent variable, <m>t</m>, changes. This is like saying, no matter what time of day it is if you get hungry, you walk toward the kitchen. 
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<paragraphs><title> Patterns in the Slope Field </title>
		<p>
			In addition to horizontal symmetry, the slope field of an autonomous differential equation also exhibits unique pattern along certain <m>y</m> values. For example,<xref ref="slope-field-y-ysqrd"/> shows the slope field for the autonomous equation
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = y(1 - y).
		</me>

		<p>
			In this figure you can see an interesting horizontal behavior along two values of <m>y</m>.

				<caption>Slope field for <m>y' = y - t</m></caption>
			</figure>
		</sidebyside>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = 4y(1 - y).
		</me>

		<p>
			The slope field for this equation has two important horizontal lines: <m>y = 0</m> and <m>y = 1</m>. Along both lines, the slope is zero, because <m>f(y)</m> equals zero there. That means the solution isn't changing—these are equilibrium solutions. They show up in the slope field as rows of horizontal line segments.
		</p>

		<p>
			What about other values of <m>y</m>? If <m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1</m>, then <m>f(y) = 4y(1 - y)</m> is positive, so the slope is pointing upward, and solutions are increasing. If <m>y &lt; 0</m> or <m>y &gt; 1</m>, then <m>f(y)</m> is negative, and the solutions are decreasing. The slope field shows this clearly: above <m>y = 1</m> and below <m>y = 0</m>, the tiny segments tilt downward.
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the coolest things about autonomous equations is that once you know one solution curve, you can get many more by simply sliding it left or right. That's because the slope field looks the same on every vertical slice—it never changes with <m>t</m>! This symmetry means solutions are horizontally shiftable, and we'll use this idea often in future sections (see Figure).
		</p>

		<p>
			When the first-order differential equation <xref ref="yp-equals-fty"/> lacks <m>t</m> terms, then its form becomes:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt}=f(y),
			</me>
			where the slopes from <m>f(y)</m> are determined by just <m>y</m>. We still calculate the slope at <m>(t,y)</m>, but the value of <m>t</m> has no impact on the slope.
		</p>
	</paragraphs>

	<paragraphs><title> Definition </title>
		<p>
			Autonomous equations of the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)
			</me>
			have a special kind of slope field. Because <m>f(y)</m> doesn't depend on <m>t</m>, the slope is the same along any horizontal line. That means the tiny direction segments in the slope field are identical at all points with the same <m>y</m>-value, even if their <m>t</m>-values are different.
		</p>

		<p>
			Like all differential equations, <xref ref="def-autonomous-eqn" text="custom">autonomous differential equations</xref> have a family of solutions. However, these equations have a special set of constant solutions in the family that are both easy to find and tell us important information about the long-term behavior of all the other solutions in the family. Such solutions are called <term>equilibrium solutions</term> and have the form <m>y(t) = c</m>, where <m>c</m> is a constant.
		</p>

		<p>
			A single equation can have multiple equilibrium solutions and we find them by plugging <m>y(t) = c</m> into the <xref ref="def-autonomous-eqn" text="custom">autonomous equation</xref>, giving us
		</p>

		<me>
			y'(t) = f(y(t)) \quad\implies\quad [c]' = f(c) \quad\implies\quad f(c) = 0,
		</me>

		<p>
			where the resulting equation, <m>f(c) = 0</m>, is an algebra equation that is solved for <m>c</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, plugging <m>y(t) = c</m> into the autonomous equation
			<me>
				y' = 1-y^2
			</me>,
			gives us
			<me>
				0 = 1 - c^2 \quad\implies\quad c^2 = 1 \quad\implies\quad c = \pm 1.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			So, the equilibrium solutions for this equation are <m>y(t) = 1</m> and <m>y(t) = -1</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is important to emphasize that although we found <m>y</m> as if it were a number, the equilibrium solutions are actually constant functions, defined for all <m>t</m>. Graphing these solutions, would display two horizontal lines crossing at <m>y = 1</m> and <m>y = -1</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For an autonomous equation like <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y)</m>, we find these constant solutions by solving <m>f(y) = 0</m>. That gives us the values of <m>y</m> where the slope is zero—where the solution graph is perfectly flat.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now let's try a slightly more interesting differential equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4.
		</me>

		<p>
			This equation has multiple equilibrium points and reveals a rich variety of behavior depending on the starting value of <m>y(0)</m>. We'll use slope fields and phase lines to explore how solutions evolve over time.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the autonomous differential equation:
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 - 4y.
					</me>
					1. Identify the equilibrium solutions.
					2. Determine the stability of each equilibrium solution.
					3. Sketch the phase line for this equation.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The equilibrium solutions occur when <m>f(y) = 0</m>, which gives us:
					<me>
						y^2 - 4y = 0 \implies y(y - 4) = 0 \implies y = 0 \text{ or } y = 4.
					</me>
					The stability can be determined by analyzing the sign of <m>f(y)</m> around these points:
					- For <m>y &lt; 0</m>, <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> (solutions increase).
					- For <m>0 &lt; y &lt; 4</m>, <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> (solutions decrease).
					- For <m>y &gt; 4</m>, <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> (solutions increase).
					
					This means:
					- <m>y = 0</m> is an unstable equilibrium (solutions move away).
					- <m>y = 4</m> is a stable equilibrium (solutions move towards it).
				</p>
