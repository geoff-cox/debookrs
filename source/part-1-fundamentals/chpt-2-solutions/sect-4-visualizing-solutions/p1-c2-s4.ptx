	<p>
		To get a visual idea of these solutions, consider the differential equation
		<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
		which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3. </m>
	</p>  

	<p>
		Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ (see <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1"/>).
