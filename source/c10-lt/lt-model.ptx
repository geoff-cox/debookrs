	<title>Modeling with Laplace Transforms</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			The Laplace transform converts differential equations into algebraic equations, making them easier to solve, especially when dealing with piecewise or discontinuous forcing functions. This transform-based approach is fundamental in engineering, particularly in control systems and signal processing.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we'll use the Laplace transform to analyze a pharmaceutical delivery problem where drug concentration must be carefully controlled.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection>
		<title>The Problem: Drug Dosing and Pharmacokinetics</title>

		<p>
			When a drug is administered (orally or by injection), it enters the bloodstream, distributes through the body, and is gradually eliminated by metabolism and excretion. The concentration must remain within a therapeutic window—high enough to be effective but not so high as to be toxic.
		</p>

		<p>
			How should we schedule doses to maintain safe and effective drug levels?
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Assumptions</title>

		<ul>
			<li>The drug distributes instantaneously and uniformly (one-compartment model).</li>
			<li>Elimination follows first-order kinetics: rate proportional to concentration.</li>
			<li>Drug is administered as instantaneous doses (impulses) or as infusions.</li>
			<li>The body's volume of distribution is constant.</li>
			<li>No drug-drug interactions or changing physiology.</li>
		</ul>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Building the Model</title>

		<p>
			Let <m>C(t)</m> be the drug concentration in blood (mg/L) at time <m>t</m> (hours). The rate of change is:
			<me>
				\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC + I(t)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			where:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><m>k > 0</m>: elimination rate constant (1/hour), related to half-life by <m>t_{1/2} = \ln(2)/k</m></li>
			<li><m>I(t)</m>: input rate (mg/(L·hour)), representing drug administration</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<term>Case 1: Single Bolus Dose</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			For an instantaneous dose <m>D</m> mg at <m>t = 0</m>, distributed in volume <m>V</m> L:
			<me>
				I(t) = \frac{D}{V}\delta(t)
			</me>
			where <m>\delta(t)</m> is the Dirac delta function.
		</p>

		<p>
			Taking the Laplace transform with <m>C(0) = 0</m>:
			<md>
				<mrow> sC(s) \amp = -kC(s) + \frac{D}{V} </mrow>
				<mrow> C(s) \amp = \frac{D/V}{s + k} </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Inverse transform gives:
			<me>
				C(t) = \frac{D}{V}e^{-kt}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Case 2: Repeated Doses</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			Doses <m>D</m> given every <m>\tau</m> hours. After <m>n</m> doses, the concentration accumulates:
			<me>
				C(t) = \frac{D}{V}e^{-kt}\left(1 + e^{-k\tau} + e^{-2k\tau} + \cdots + e^{-(n-1)k\tau}\right)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			At steady state (many doses), using geometric series:
			<me>
				C_{\text{max}} = \frac{D/V}{1 - e^{-k\tau}}, \quad C_{\text{min}} = C_{\text{max}}e^{-k\tau}
			</me>
		</p>

		<title>Simulation Activity</title>

		<p>
			<term>Objective:</term> Determine optimal dosing regimen to maintain concentration in therapeutic range.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Given Parameters:</term>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Drug: Amoxicillin (common antibiotic)</li>
			<li>Elimination half-life: <m>t_{1/2} = 1</m> hour (so <m>k = \ln(2) \approx 0.693</m>/hour)</li>
			<li>Volume of distribution: <m>V = 30</m> L</li>
			<li>Therapeutic range: 5-20 mg/L</li>
			<li>Available doses: 250 mg or 500 mg</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<term>Tasks:</term>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Simulate a single 500 mg dose. Plot <m>C(t)</m> for 8 hours. How long does concentration stay in the therapeutic range?</li>
			<li>Test dosing regimens:
				<ul>
					<li>250 mg every 4 hours</li>
					<li>500 mg every 6 hours</li>
					<li>500 mg every 8 hours</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>For each regimen, plot <m>C(t)</m> showing at least 5 doses.</li>
			<li>Calculate <m>C_{\text{max}}</m> and <m>C_{\text{min}}</m> at steady state for each regimen.</li>
			<li>Which regimen keeps concentration in the therapeutic window?</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<term>Advanced: Loading Dose</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			To reach steady state immediately, use a loading dose <m>D_L</m> followed by maintenance doses <m>D_M</m>. Calculate:
			<me>
				D_L = D_M \cdot \frac{1}{1 - e^{-k\tau}}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Simulate this strategy and compare with regular dosing.

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			The Laplace transform is particularly powerful for systems with discontinuous inputs, making it ideal for pharmacokinetics where drugs are administered as discrete doses. This mathematical framework enables rational drug dosing design, ensuring safety and efficacy. Understanding these models is crucial in pharmacy, medicine, and pharmaceutical research. The same techniques apply to chemical engineering (batch processes), environmental science (pollutant transport), and any system involving pulsed or interrupted inputs.
