		This chapter covers a solution technique called <em>separation of variables</em>, a powerful tool for solving first order differential equations that can be rearranged in a form where the independent and dependent variables can be isolated on opposite sides of the equation. In this new form, the general solution can be obtained by integrating both sides of the equation.

		In this chapter, we will learn to identify when it is possible to put an equation in this special form and delve into the separation of variables process that leads to the general solution.
