		<exercise>
			<statement>
				Explain why separating variables works as a method for solving ordinary differential equations. 
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Separation of variables works by isolating all terms involving <m>y</m> to one side and all terms involving <m>x</m> to the other. When this can be done, both sides can be integrated independently, allowing for the solution of the differential equation. This method effectively transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into the simpler task of integrating functions.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</exercise>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				Why is it important for the equation to be "separable" in order to use the method of separation of variables? What does it mean for a differential equation to be separable?
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					For the method of separation of variables to be used, we must be able to write the differential equation in the form <m>g(y) dy = h(x) dx</m>, effectively separating the variables <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> onto different sides of the equation. When a differential equation can be written in this way, it is called separable. Separability is crucial because it allows us to integrate each side with respect to its own variable, leading to a solution for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</exercise>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				Provide an example of a differential equation that is not separable and explain why the method of separation of variables cannot be applied to it.
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					
				</p>
			</solution>
		</exercise>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				In solving a differential equation using separation of variables, why might the constant of integration appear on both sides of the resulting equation?
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					After separating variables, we integrate both sides of the equation. Each integration will typically introduce its own constant of integration. Therefore, when we combine the results of these integrations, we often see a constant on both sides. These constants can often be combined into a single constant by subtracting one from the other.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</exercise>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield implicit solutions, while others yield explicit solutions. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit solutions, and provide examples of each.
			</statement>
			<solution>
