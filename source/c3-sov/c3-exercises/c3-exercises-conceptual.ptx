					<solution><title> (a) </title>
						<p>
							The method of separation of variables is named as such because it involves isolating all terms involving <m>y</m> to one side and all terms involving <m>x</m> to the other. This effectively separates the variables <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> onto different sides of the equation, allowing for the integration of each side independently. The name "separation of variables" reflects the process of isolating the variables onto different sides of the equation.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (b) </title>
						<p>
							The next step in the process says to divide both sides by the function of <m>y</m>. In our case, this is <m>y^2</m>, so we would get
							<me>
								\frac{1}{y^2} \frac{dy}{dx} = 1 + \frac{x}{y^2}
							</me>. 
							Now, multiplying both sides by <m>dx</m> and integrating would yield
							<me>
								\int \frac{1}{y^2} dy = \int \left( 1 + \frac{x}{y^2} \right) dx
							</me>.
							The integral on the left side is fine, but the integral on the right side is where the process breaks down since the integral wants to integrate with respect to <m>x</m>. Therefore, you are stuck unless you knew <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>. However, if this were the case, you would have already solved the problem!
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (c) </title>
						<p>
							An example of a differential equation that is not separable is <m> \frac{dy}{dx} = y + x^2 </m>. This equation is not separable because the terms involving <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are not easily separable onto different sides of the equation. In this case, the method of separation of variables cannot be applied because the terms involving <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are not easily separable.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
				<p>
					<solution><title> (d) </title>
						<p>
							After separating variables, we integrate both sides of the equation. Each integration will typically introduce its own constant of integration. Therefore, when we combine the results of these integrations, we often see a constant on both sides. These constants can often be combined into a single constant by subtracting one from the other.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (e) </title>
						<p>
							An implicit solution is one where the relationship between <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> is not explicitly defined. For example, the solution <m> x^2 + y^2 = 1 </m> is an implicit solution. An explicit solution, on the other hand, is one where <m>y</m> is defined explicitly as a function of <m>x</m>. For example, the solution <m> y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} </m> is an explicit solution.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (f) </title>
						<p>
							False. Not every first-order ordinary differential equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables. The method of separation of variables is only applicable to differential equations that can be written in the form <m> M(y)dy = N(x)dx </m>. If a differential equation cannot be written in this form, then the method of separation of variables cannot be applied.

						<p>
							False. Not every first-order ordinary differential equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables. The method of separation of variables is only applicable to differential equations that can be written in the form <m> M(y)dy = N(x)dx </m>. If a differential equation cannot be written in this form, then the method of separation of variables cannot be applied.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (b) </title>
						<p>
							False. The solution to a separable differential equation is sometimes implicit function of independent variable.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (c) </title>
						<p>
							False. The method of separation of variables is only applicable to first-order differential equations.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
				<p>
					<solution><title> (d) </title>
						<p>
							True. Any differential equation that can be written in the form 
							<me> 
								h(y) \frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)
							</me>
							can also be rewritten in the separable form
							<me>
								\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x)\cdot \frac{1}{h(y)}
							</me>.
						</p>
					</solution>
					<solution><title> (e) </title>
						<p>
							<p>
								The correct answer is: It is always separable.
							</p>
							<p>
								This differential equation is the same as
								<me>
									\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x) \cdot (1)
								</me>,
								which shows that the equation is separable since the function of <m>y</m> can be constant.
