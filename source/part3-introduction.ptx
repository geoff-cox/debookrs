		As we delve deeper into the study of differential equations, we transition from first-order equations to those involving second derivatives and higher. These higher-order equations are essential for modeling complex systems in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

		In this part of the text, we focus on a particularly important class of differential equations known as <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>. We will learn to solve these equations using various methods, including the characteristic equation, undetermined coefficients, and variation of parameters. By mastering these techniques, you will develop a robust toolkit for solving a wide range of higher-order linear differential equations

		We will split our approach into two subcases based on whether the equation we are solving has a constant term of zero (homogeneous) or a non-zero constant term (nonhomogeneous).
