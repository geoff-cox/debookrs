		Now that we've tackled some foundational techniques for solving differential equations, it's time to introduce a new type: linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC equations for short. But how do we recognize them? Let's break down each part of the term <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em> to understand these equations fully.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		First, recall that a <term>linear differential equation</term> looks like this:
		<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
			{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
			\os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x).}}
		</men>
		The key idea here is that each term involves either a derivative of <m>y</m> or <m>y</m> itself, all multiplied by coefficients that depend on <m>x</m>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Next, the equation is <term>homogeneous</term> if the constant term is zero, meaning <m>f(x) = 0</m>. This ensures the left-hand side of the equation equals zero.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Finally, if all the coefficients are constants (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>), the equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
	</p>
	
	<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
		<title>LHCC Equation</title>
		<statement>
		<p>
			A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
		</p>
		<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
		</men>
		<p>
			where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
		</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>
	
	<p>
		Now that we have the definition, let's practice identifying these equations with a few examples.
	</p>
	
	<example>
		<m>\ \ </m> Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
		<p>
			<me> 
				3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad 
				\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad 
				\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s
			</me>
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
			</p>
			<p> 
				<me> 
				3y'' - 2ty' + y = {\color{blue} 0}, \quad 
				\frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{blue} -3x^2}, \quad 
				\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{blue} 0} 
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	
	<example>
		<m>\ \ </m> Determine which of the following equations have constant coefficients.
		<p>
			<me> 
				3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad 
				\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad 
				s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
			</me>
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				Check if each coefficient is constant:
			</p>
			<p>
				<me> 
					\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{3}}} y'' - 
					\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{2\tau}}}\ y' + 
					\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} y = \tau, \quad
					\sqrt{t} - 
					\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} \frac{dP}{dt} - 
					\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{1}{2}}}} P^2 = 1, \quad
					\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} s''' = 
					\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}} s
				</me>.
				The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.
			</p>
