	<p>
		From the previous section, we know that solutions to LHCC equations involve terms of the form <m>e^{rx}</m>. However, not every value of <m>r</m> will work. The correct values of <m>r</m> come from solving a special algebraic equation, which we get by substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the differential equation. In this section, we'll explore this process for first-order equations and gradually build up to higher-order equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's start by considering the simple first-order equation:
		<me> y' - 5y = 0 </me>
		We want to find the value of <m>r</m> such that <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is a solution. By substituting <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the equation, we get:
		<md>
			<mrow> \left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right]	=\amp\ 0 </mrow>
			<mrow> r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx}							=\amp\ 0 </mrow>
			<mrow> (r - 5) e^{rx}								=\amp\ 0 </mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we must have:
		<md>
			<mrow> r - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad r = 5 </mrow>
		</md>
		This tells us that <m>y = e^{5x}</m> is a solution, and the general solution is:
		<me> y = C e^{5x} </me>
		The equation <m>r - 5 = 0</m> that gave us the value of <m>r</m> is called the <term>characteristic equation</term>, and every LHCC equation has one. The characteristic equation provides the values of <m>r</m> that we need to form the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		More generally, if we plug <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into any first-order LHCC equation of the form:
		<me> ay' + by = 0 </me>
		the characteristic equation is:
		<me> ar + b = 0 </me>
		Let's apply this method to a couple more examples.
	</p>

	<example>
		
		<m>\ \ </m> Find the general solution to these 1st-order LHCC equations:
		
		<p>
			<me> 3y' - 9y = 0 \hspace{5em} 5y' = \pi y </me>
		</p>

		<solution>

			<p>
				First, rewrite each equation in standard form to confirm it's an LHCC equation:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<me> y' - 3y = 0 \hspace{5em} 5y' - \pi y = 0 </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, solve the characteristic equations:
				<md>
					<mrow> 3r - 9 	=\amp\ 0 \hspace{5em} 5r - \pi = 0 		</mrow>
					<mrow> r 		=\amp\ 3 \hspace{5em} r = \frac{\pi}{5}	</mrow>
				</md>
				Therefore, the general solutions are:
				<me> y = C e^{3x} \hspace{5em} y = C e^{\frac{\pi}{5}x} </me>
			</p>

		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		By following this process, we can solve any first-order LHCC equation using the characteristic equation. This method is simple, efficient, and can be extended to higher-order equations, which we'll explore in the following sections.
