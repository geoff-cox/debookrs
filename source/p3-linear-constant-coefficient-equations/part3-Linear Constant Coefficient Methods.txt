<part><title> Linear Constant Coefficient Methods </title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            As we delve deeper into the world of differential equations, it's time to expand our solution techniques beyond first-order equations. Higher-order linear differential equations, those involving second derivatives or higher, are fundamental in modeling more complex systems in physics, engineering, and other fields. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In this chapter, we will explore powerful methods for solving these equations, starting with the characteristic equation for linear homogeneous equations with constant coefficients. We'll then move on to techniques like undetermined coefficients and variation of parameters, which provide us with tools to tackle non-homogeneous equations. By mastering these methods, you'll gain a robust toolkit for solving a wide range of higher-order linear differential equations.

        <introduction>
            <p>
                As you might expect, solving differential equations becomes more challenging as the order of the derivative increases. But don't worry! There's a class of higher-order equations that are not only approachable but also serve as a gateway to more advanced topics. These are known as linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC for short.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In this chapter, we will learn how to identify LHCC equations and explore a method to solve them by connecting them to a polynomial equation, called the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this section, you'll see how solving higher-order equations can be as simple as finding the roots of a polynomial.

                Now that we've tackled some foundational techniques for solving differential equations, it's time to introduce a new type: linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC equations for short. But how do we recognize them? Let's break down each part of the term <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em> to understand these equations fully.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                First, recall that a <term>linear differential equation</term> looks like this:
                <men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
                {\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
                {\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
                {\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
                {\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
                \os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x).}}
                </men>
                The key idea here is that each term involves either a derivative of <m>y</m> or <m>y</m> itself, all multiplied by coefficients that depend on <m>x</m>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Next, the equation is <term>homogeneous</term> if the constant term is zero, meaning <m>f(x) = 0</m>. This ensures the left-hand side of the equation equals zero.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Finally, if all the coefficients are constants (i.e., numbers, not functions of <m>x</m>), the equation is said to have <term>constant coefficients</term>.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Combining these ideas, we arrive at the formal definition of an LHCC equation.
            </p>
            
            <definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
                <title>LHCC Equation</title>
                <statement>
                <p>
                    A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) is of the form:
                </p>
                <men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
                    a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
                </men>
                <p>
                    where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
                </p>
                </statement>
            </definition>
            
            <p>
                Now that we have the definition, let's practice identifying these equations with a few examples.
            </p>
            
            <example>
                <m>\ \ </m> Identify which of the following are linear homogeneous differential equations.
                <p>
                    <me> 
                        3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad 
                        \frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad 
                        \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s

                </p>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        The trick is to check if the constant term is zero and the equation has only <m>y</m> and its derivatives on the left-hand side. Let's rewrite each equation with the constant term isolated:
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        <me>

                        \frac{dg}{dx} = {\color{blue} -3x^2}, \quad 
                        \frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{blue} 0} 
                        </me>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first and last equations are homogeneous, but the second is not because the right-hand side is non-zero.

                        The second equation has constant coefficients, while the others do not.

            <p>
                Before diving into how to solve <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>, let's develop some intuition about what the solutions should look like. We begin with the simple first-order LHCC equation,
                <men xml:id="lhcc-intro-de"> 
                    y' - 2 y = 0
                </men>
                and note that this equation requires <m>y' - 2y</m> to sum to zero. Recall from algebra that only <xref ref="like-terms" text="custom">like terms</xref> can combine to simplify to zero. 
                So, for the equation to hold, <m>y'</m> and <m>y</m> must be like terms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's test a few guesses for <m>y</m>: 
                <m>y = x^2</m>, <m>y = 2 \ln x</m>, and <m>y = e^{2x}</m>.

            <p>
                As you can see, only <m>y = e^{2x}</m> produces like terms that simplify to zero. This is why exponential functions often work well in LHCC equations. Let's now examine a more complex example to expand on this idea.
            </p>

            <example>
                <m>\ \ </m> Consider the LHCC equation:

                    Verify that <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution, but <m>y = x^4</m> and <m>y = \sin(4x)</m> are not.

            <p>
                This example further supports the claim that exponential functions, like <m>e^{rx}</m>, are well-suited for LHCC equations because they produce like terms when differentiated. Later, we will see that if <m>e^{rx}</m> is a solution then, in some cases, it is possible for <m>xe^{rx}</m> to be a solution as well.

                We conclude this section with an important concept that will guide us in the sections to follow.
