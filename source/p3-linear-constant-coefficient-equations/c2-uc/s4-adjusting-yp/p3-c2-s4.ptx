<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>

	<p>
		As discussed in the previous sections, the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, and the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. This relationship is expressed as:
		<me>
			y = y_h + y_p
		</me>.
		However, it is possible for the particular solution to contain terms that overlap with those in the homogeneous solution. When this occurs, parts of the particular solution can be absorbed into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that does not accurately match the nonhomogeneous term on the right-hand side of the equation. This section highlights this issue and provides a strategy to resolve it.
	</p>

	<p>
		To illustrate this, consider the LNCC equation:
		<me>
			y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}
		</me>.
		Here, the homogeneous and particular solutions are:
		<me>
			y_h = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x}, \qquad y_p = A e^{3x}
		</me>.
		The problem arises when you observe that <m>Ae^{3x}</m> in <m>y_p</m> is similar to <m>c_2 e^{3x}</m> in <m>y_h</m>, causing the general solution to become:
		<me>
			y = y_h + y_p = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x} + A e^{3x} = c_1 e^{x} + (c_2 + A) e^{3x}.
		</me>
		As a result, the particular solution effectively vanishes into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that fails to reflect the nonhomogeneous term <m>e^{3x}</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To address this, we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> until there are no overlapping terms between <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. In this example, multiplying <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> once is sufficient to make it independent of <m>y_h</m>. The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is:
		<me>
			y_p = A x e^{3x}.
		</me>
	</p>

	<theorem><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				When the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, contains terms in common with the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by repeatedly multiplying the overlapping terms by <m>x</m> until <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> share no terms in common.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</theorem>

	<p>
		Let's explore this adjustment process through a few examples.
	</p>

	<example>
		<p>
			 Find the adjusted form of the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, for each of the following LNCC equations.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds y'' - 2y' + y = e^x </m>.
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
							First, determine <m>y_h</m> by solving the characteristic equation:
							<me>r^2 - 2r + 1 = 0</me>,
							which yields a repeated root <m>r_1 = 1</m>, giving the homogeneous solution:
							<me>y_h = c_1 e^x + c_2 x e^x</me>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since the nonhomogeneous term is <m>e^x</m>, the initial guess for the particular solution is:
							<me> y_p = A e^x</me>.
							However, this form overlaps with <m>c_1 e^x</m> in <m>y_h</m>. To resolve this, multiply <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m>:
							<me> y_p = A x e^x</me>,
							which now overlaps with <m>c_2 x e^x</m>. Multiplying by <m>x</m> again gives:
							<me> y_p = A x^2 e^x</me>,
							which has no terms in common with <m>y_h</m>. This is the correct form to use for <m>y_p</m>.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds y''' + 4y' = \cos(2x) - \sin(x) </m>.
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
							First, solve the characteristic equation:
							<me>r^3 + 4r = 0</me>,
							which yields the roots <m>r_1 = 0</m>, <m>r_2 = 2i</m>, and <m>r_3 = -2i</m>. This results in the homogeneous solution:
							<me>y_h = c_1 + c_2 \cos(2x) + c_3 \sin(2x)</me>.
						</p>
						<p>
							For the nonhomogeneous term <m>\cos(2x) - \sin(x)</m>, the initial guess for <m>y_p</m> is:
							<me> y_p = \ub{A \cos(2x) + B \sin(2x)}_{\text{common terms with } y_h} + \ub{D \cos(x) + E \sin(x)}_{\text{NO common terms with } y_h}</me>.
							Since <m>A \cos(2x)</m> and <m>B \sin(2x)</m> overlap with terms in <m>y_h</m>, multiply these terms by <m>x</m>:
							<me> y_p = \ub{Ax \cos(2x) + B x \sin(2x)}_{\text{now independent}} + \ub{D \cos(x) + E \sin(x)}_{\text{already independent}}</me>.
							The terms in <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> are now independent, making this the correct form for <m>y_p</m>.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds y'' + y = x e^x </m>.
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
							Begin by solving the characteristic equation:
							<me>r^2 + 1 = 0</me>,
							which yields the roots <m>r_1 = i</m> and <m>r_2 = -i</m>, leading to the homogeneous solution:
							<me>y_h = c_1 \cos(x) + c_2 \sin(x)</me>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since the nonhomogeneous term is <m>x e^x</m>, the initial guess for <m>y_p</m> is:
							<me> y_p = (Ax + B) e^x </me>.
							This form is not present in <m>y_h</m>, so no further adjustment is needed. To determine the coefficients <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, substitute <m>y_p</m> back into the differential equation and solve for these values.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds y'' - 6y' + 9y = x^2 e^{3x} </m>.
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
							First, determine <m>y_h</m> by solving the characteristic equation:
							<me>r^2 - 6r + 9 = 0</me>,
							which yields a repeated root <m>r = 3</m>, giving the homogeneous solution:
							<me>y_h = (c_1 + c_2 x) e^{3x}</me>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since the nonhomogeneous term is <m>x^2 e^{3x}</m>, the initial guess for the particular solution is:
							<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C) e^{3x}</me>.
							However, notice that <m>e^{3x}</m> and <m>x e^{3x}</m> are already present in <m>y_h</m>.
							To avoid overlap, multiply <m>y_p</m> by <m>x^2</m>, giving:
							<me>y_p = (Ax^4 + Bx^3 + Cx^2) e^{3x}</me>.
							This form is now independent of <m>y_h</m>, ensuring that there are no overlapping terms.
						</p>
						<p>
							To determine the coefficients <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, substitute <m>y_p</m> back into the original differential equation and solve for these values.
						</p>
					</solution>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</example>

	<p>
		This adjustment process ensures that <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> are independent, allowing the general solution <m>y = y_h + y_p</m> to properly reflect the nonhomogeneous function on the right-hand side of the differential equation.
