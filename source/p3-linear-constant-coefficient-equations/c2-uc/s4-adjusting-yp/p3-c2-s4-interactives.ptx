		<statement>
			Which of the following is the correct particular solution form for the differential equation <m> y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x </m>?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ax + B </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The right-hand side is linear, so the particular solution takes the form <m> Ax + B </m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ae^x </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The right-hand side of the equation is a polynomial, not exponential.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = A \cos x + B \sin x </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This form would be used if the non-homogeneous term were trigonometric.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ae^{3x} </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This form would be used if the right-hand side was exponential.</feedback>
