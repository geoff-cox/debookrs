		<statement>
			Which of the following is the correct particular solution form for the differential equation <m> y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x </m>?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ax + B </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The right-hand side is linear, so the particular solution takes the form <m> Ax + B </m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ae^x </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The right-hand side of the equation is a polynomial, not exponential.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = A \cos x + B \sin x </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This form would be used if the non-homogeneous term were trigonometric.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> y_p = Ae^{3x} </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This form would be used if the right-hand side was exponential.</feedback>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s4-rq2"><title> <em>What should be done when the particular part, <m>y_p</m>, overlaps with the homogeneous part, <m>y_h</m>, of a solution to an LNCC equation?</em> </title>
		<statement> 
			What should be done when the particular part, <m>y_p</m>, overlaps with the homogeneous part, <m>y_h</m>, of a solution to an LNCC equation?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>The particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, should be left as is.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The <m>y_p</m> cannot have terms in common with <m>y_h</m>. </feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>The overlapping terms in <m>y_h</m> should be removed.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. No terms in <m>y_h</m> should ever be removed.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><p>The particular solution needs to be multiplied by <m>x</m> until there are no terms in common with <m>y_h</m>.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Correct!</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_h</m> should be multiplied by <m>x</m> to match the particular solution.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The particular solution should be adjusted, not the homogeneous solution.</feedback>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s4-rq3"><title> <em>What is the adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> for the LNCC equation <me>y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}</me>?</em> </title>
		<statement>
			What is the adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> for the LNCC equation <me>y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}</me>?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_p = A e^{3x}</m></p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The nonhomogeneous term is <m>e^{3x}</m>, so the initial guess for <m>y_p</m> should be <m>A e^{3x}</m>. However, this form overlaps with <m>y_h</m>. To resolve this, multiply <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> until there are no terms in common with <m>y_h</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><p><m>y_p = A x e^{3x}</m></p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is <m>A x e^{3x}</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_p = A x^2 e^{3x}</m></p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_p = A e^{x}</m></p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect.</p>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s4-rq4"><title> <em>If the nonhomogeneous term in an LNCC equation is <m>x^2 e^{3x}</m> and <m>y_h = (c_1 + c_2 x) e^{3x}</m>, what should be the adjusted form of <m>y_p</m>?</em> </title>
		<statement> 
			<p>If the nonhomogeneous term in an LNCC equation is <m>x^2 e^{3x}</m> and <m>y_h = (c_1 + c_2 x) e^{3x}</m>, what should be the adjusted form of <m>y_p</m>?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_p = A x^2 e^{3x}</m></p></statement>

			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><p><m>y_p = (A x^4 + B x^3 + C x^2) e^{3x}</m></p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>
						Correct! The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is <m>(A x^4 + B x^3 + C x^2) e^{3x}</m>.

			<p>Why is it necessary to multiply the initial form of <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> in some cases?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><p>To ensure that <m>y_p</m> does not share terms with <m>y_h</m>, making them independent.</p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! Multiplying by <m>x</m> ensures that <m>y_p</m> and <m>y_h</m> have no terms in common.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>To make <m>y_p</m> smaller than <m>y_h</m>.</p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The size of <m>y_p</m> is not the issue.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>To change the characteristic equation.</p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Multiplying by <m>x</m> does not affect the characteristic equation.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>To remove the nonhomogeneous term from the equation.</p></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The nonhomogeneous term should remain in the equation.</p>
