	<p>
		Selecting the correct form of <m>y_p</m> is just the initial step in finding a particular solution. The next task is computing the value of its coefficients (e.g., <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, etc.), which we will cover here.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Let's do this by revisiting the example from the introduction. We now know a particular solution to the differential equation
		<me>
			y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
		</me>
		has the form
		<me>
			y_p = Ax + B
		</me>
		and we would like to find the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. This is done by plugging <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation and matching the coefficients of the <q>like-terms</q> on both sides of the equation. Plugging in <m>y_p</m> gives
		<md>
			<mrow> y'' - 4y' + 3y =\ \amp 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> (Ax + B)'' - 4(Ax + B)' + 3(Ax + B) =\ \amp 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 0 - 4(A) + 3(Ax + B) =\ \amp 9x </mrow>
			<mrow>	-4A + 3Ax + 3B =\ \amp 9x	</mrow>
			<mrow>	(3A)x + (- 4A + 3B) =\ \amp 9x	</mrow>
		</md>
		The last equation says <q>The first degree polynomial on the LHS is equal to the first degree polynomial on the RHS</q> and the only way two polynomials can be equal is if the coefficients of the <q>like-terms</q> are equal. Visually, this looks like

		and to find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we solve the system of equations
		<md>
			<mrow> 3A =\ \amp 9 \ \ \implies \ \  A = 3 \ {\LARGE â¬Ž} </mrow>
			<mrow> -4A + 3B =\ \amp 0 \ \ \implies \ \ -4(3) + 3B = 0 \ \ \implies \ \ B = 4</mrow>
		</md>
		Therefore, the particular solution is <m>y_p = 3x + 4</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Regardless of <m>y_p</m>'s form, the process of finding the coefficients is the same. 
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>
				<p>
					Plug <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Collect like terms.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Set the coefficients of the like terms on opposite sides equal.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Solve the system of equations for <m>A, B, C, \ldots</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<assemblage><title>Tip</title>
		<p>
			It is worth noting that you should get exactly one value for every coefficient. If you find that it is impossible to find a coefficient or if you find multiple values for the same one, then you should double-check your work.  
		</p>

		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					If <m>g(t)</m> contains an exponential, ignore it and write down the guess for the remainder.  Then tack the exponential back on without any leading coefficient.
				</li>
				<li>
					For products of polynomials and trig functions you first write down the guess for just the polynomial and multiply that by the appropriate cosine.  Then add on a new guess for the polynomial with different coefficients and multiply that by the appropriate sine.
				</li>
				<li>
					So, when dealing with sums of functions make sure that you look for identical guesses that may or may not be contained in other guesses and combine them.  This will simplify your work later on.
				</li>
