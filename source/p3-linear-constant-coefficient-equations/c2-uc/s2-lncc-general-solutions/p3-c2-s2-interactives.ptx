		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><m>y = c_1e^{-x} + c_2e^{2x} + 5x - 3</m>.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The general solution combines the homogeneous and particular parts.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>y = c_1e^{-x} + c_2e^{2x} - 5x + 3</m>.</statement>

			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>y = c_1e^{-x} + c_2e^{2x}</m>.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This is only the homogeneous solution, not the complete general solution.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>y = 5x - 3</m>.</statement>

			What is the purpose of the particular solution <m>y_p</m> in solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>To represent the general solution of the homogeneous equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is called the complementary solution, not the particular solution.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>To determine the coefficients of the characteristic equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The characteristic equation is related to the complementary solution and does not involve the particular solution.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>To account for the non-homogeneous term <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side of the equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The particular solution is chosen to match the form of <m>f(x)</m> and account for its influence in the equation.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>To simplify the process of solving the differential equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The particular solution addresses the specific form of <m>f(x)</m> and is part of solving the non-homogeneous equation, but its purpose isn't simplification.</feedback>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s2-rq3"><title>How is the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m> of an LNCC equation typically found?</title>
		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>By solving the characteristic equation associated with the homogeneous equation.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The characteristic equation provides the exponents for the homogeneous solution.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>By integrating the equation twice.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Solving the characteristic equation is the standard method for homogeneous solutions.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>By guessing the solution and checking.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The characteristic equation is the systematic way to find the homogeneous solution.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>By using boundary conditions.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Boundary conditions are used to find specific constants, not to find <m>y_h</m>.</feedback>
