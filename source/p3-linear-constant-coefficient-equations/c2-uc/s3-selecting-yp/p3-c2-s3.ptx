<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Selecting Particular Solutions </title>

	<p>
		As discussed in the previous section, solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations involves finding a solution that satisfies the equation:
		<me>
			a_n y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2 y'' + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
		</me>.
		The challenge is that the terms on the left side need to combine in just the right way to match <m>f(x)</m> on the right. This means the form of the particular solution must resemble <m>f(x)</m> closely. When <m>f(x)</m> contains polynomial, exponential, or trigonometric (sine or cosine) terms, the particular solution should involve similar components.
	</p>

	<p>
		The specific function that accounts for <m>f(x)</m> on the right side is known as the <term>particular solution</term>, denoted <m>y_p</m>. The form of this solution depends on the type of function <m>f(x)</m> represents. To help select the correct form of <m>y_p</m>, refer to <xref ref="yp-table"/>, which outlines the most common types of <m>f(x)</m> and their corresponding <m>y_p</m> forms.

		In this table, the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, <m>\alpha</m>, and <m>\beta</m> are assumed to be known, while <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc., need to be determined. We will explore how to determine these coefficients in the next section. For now, we are concerned with picking the correct form. Let's work through a few examples to solidify this process.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Find the form of <m>y_p</m> for each of the equations below.
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds y'' + y' + 5y = 3e^{6x} </m>
				</p>
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Since <m>f(x) = 3e^{6x}</m> has the form <m>a e^{\alpha x}</m>, we set <me>y_p = Ae^{6x}</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds y'' + 3y' - y = 2\sin(2x) </m>
				</p>

				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<m>2\sin(2x)</m> has the form <m>a \sin(\beta x)</m>, so <me>y_p = A\sin(2x) + B\cos(2x)</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds \omega''' + \omega' = 5\theta^2 + \theta + 1 </m>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<m>5\theta^2 + \theta + 1</m> has the form <m>a\theta^2+b\theta+c</m>, so <me>\omega_p = A\theta^2 + B\theta + C</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds 2\frac{dy}{dx} + 5y = -3 </m>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Since <m>f(x) = -3</m> is of the form <m>a</m>, we set <me>y_p = A</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds y'' -3y' + 0.5y = 14x^4 </m>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Even though <m>f(x) = 14x^4</m> only has an <m>x^4</m> term, we consider it to be of the form 
						<me>ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+e</me>, 
						where <m>b = c = d = e = 0</m>. Therefore,
						<me>y_p = Ax^4+Bx^3+Cx^2+Dx+E</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>
	</example>

	<p>
		When <m>f(x)</m> is a sum of multiple functions, each part of the sum contributes to the form of the particular solution. In these situations, we construct <m>y_p</m> by simply adding together the particular solutions corresponding to each term in <m>f(x)</m>. Let's look at an example to clarify this approach.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Given each of the constant terms, <m>f</m>, of an LNCC equation below, find the form of <m>y_p</m> you would use.
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds 2e^{w} - 1 </m>
				</p>
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Since <m>f(w)</m> is the sum of an <m>e^{w}</m> term and a constant term, we set 
						<me>y_p = Ae^{w} + B</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds 3e^{6x} + 2\sin(2x) </m>
				</p>

				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Since <m>f(x)</m> is the sum of an <m>e^{6x}</m> term and a <m>\sin(2x)</m> term, we set 
						<me>y_p = Ae^{6x} + B\sin(2x) + C\cos(2x)</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="36% 64%">
				<p>
					<m> \ds 2\sin(-2x) - 6\cos(3x) </m>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						Since <m>f(x)</m> is the sum of a <m>\sin(-2x)</m> term and a <m>\cos(3x)</m> term, we set 
						<md>
							<mrow> y_p = A\sin(-2x)	\amp\ + B\cos(-2x)			</mrow>
							<mrow>				+	\amp\ C\sin(3x) + D\cos(3x)	</mrow>
						</md>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

	</example>

	<p>
		When <m>f(x)</m> involves products of functions, constructing <m>y_p</m> can become more involved. This is because multiplying terms may introduce extra coefficients that turn out to be unnecessary or redundant. In these cases, simplifying the solution to avoid duplication is essential. The following example illustrates this process.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Find the form of <m>y_p</m> for the equation
			<me>y'' + y' + 5y = 10x^2 e^{6x}</me>.
		</p>

		<solution><title> Solution </title>
			<p>
				Since <m>f(x) = 10x^2 e^{6x}</m> is the product of a polynomial and an exponential, we initially set:
				<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x})</me>.
				However, <m>D</m> is redundant because if we multiply it onto the polynomial, it can be absorbed into <m>A, B, </m> and <m>C</m>, as follows:
				<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x}) = \left(AD x^2 + BD x + CD\right) e^{6x}</me>.
				So, the form of <m>y_p</m> simplifies to:
				<me>y_p = \left(A x^2 + B x + C\right) e^{6x}</me>.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		Here are a few tips to help you avoid redundant coefficients when constructing the form of <m>y_p</m>.
	</p>

	<assemblage><title>Tips to Avoid Redundant Coefficients</title>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					When <m>f(x)</m> is the product of an exponential and another function, avoid writing a coefficient for the exponential term.
				</li>
				<li>
					For products of polynomials and sine/cosine functions, use:
					<me>(\text{polynomial form}) \sin(\beta x) + (\text{polynomial form}) \cos(\beta x)</me>
					where the polynomial form on each term uses different coefficients. 
				</li>
				<li>
					When working with sums, look for redundant overlapping terms.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		Let's put these tips into practice with a couple of examples.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Find the form of <m>y_p</m> for each of the equations below.
			<m> \ds y'' + y = e^{-x}\cos(x) </m>
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				Since <m>f(x) = e^{-x}\cos(x)</m> is the product of an exponential and a cosine function, we apply tip 1 and set:
				<me>y_p = e^{-x}(A\sin x + B\cos x)</me>.
			</solution>
		</p>
		<p>
			<m> \ds y'' - 4y = e^{6x}e^{-3x} </m>
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				Since <m>f(x) = e^{6x}e^{-3x}</m> is the product of two exponential functions, we ignore one of the coefficients and set:
				<me>y_p = Ae^{6x}e^{-3x}</me>.
				Note, <m>e^{6x}e^{-3x}</m> is the same as <m>e^{3x}</m>, so we could also write <m>y_p = Ae^{3x}</m>.
			</solution>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<m> \ds 9P' - P = t^{3}\cos(t) </m>
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				Since <m>f(t) = t^{3}\cos(t)</m> is the product of a polynomial and a cosine function, we apply tip 2 and set:
				<me>P_p = (At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D)\sin t + (Et^3 + Ft^2 + Gt + H)\cos t</me>.
			</solution>
		</p>

		<p>
			<m> \ds 2y'' + 3y' - 15y = x^2\cos x + x \sin x </m>
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				When setting up the particular solution, it's easy to introduce redundant terms if we aren't careful. For example, if we initially set:
				<md>
					<mrow> y_p = (Ax^2 + \ul{Bx + C) \sin x} + (Dx^2 + \ul{Ex + F)\cos x} </mrow>
				</md>
				and
				<md>
					<mrow> (\ul{Gx + H)\sin x} + (\ul{Ix + J)\cos x}, </mrow>
				</md>
				you may notice that the underlined terms introduce unnecessary repetition. By grouping like terms, we can simplify this to:
				<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)\sin x + (Dx^2 + Ex + F)\cos x</me>.
			</solution>
		</p>
