			<p>The general solution to an LNCC equation is written as <m>y = y_h + y_p</m>. What do <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> represent?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_h</m> is the solution to the homogeneous equation, and <m>y_p</m> is the particular solution that matches the non-zero right-hand side.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The general solution consists of a homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m> and a particular solution <m>y_p</m> that fits the nonhomogeneous equation.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_h</m> is the solution to the nonhomogeneous equation, and <m>y_p</m> is the solution to the homogeneous equation.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. <m>y_h</m> corresponds to the homogeneous equation, while <m>y_p</m> is the solution for the non-zero part.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p>Both <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> are solutions to the nonhomogeneous equation, but only <m>y_p</m> satisfies the initial conditions.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. <m>y_p</m> is the particular solution, but both parts contribute to the general solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><p><m>y_h</m> represents terms that cancel out the right-hand side, and <m>y_p</m> represents constants in the solution.</p></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. <m>y_h</m> cancels out the left-hand side of the homogeneous equation, and <m>y_p</m> corresponds to the right-hand side.</feedback>

			</choice>
			<choice>
			<statement><m>y = c_1e^{-x} + c_2e^{2x} - 5x + 3</m></statement>

			</choice>
			<choice>
			<statement><m>y = c_1e^{-x} - c_2e^{2x} + 5x - 3</m></statement>
