    <title>From Differential Equations to the Laplace Domain</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            In this section, we begin our journey through the Laplace transform method. The first step is transforming a differential equation from the original domain—where unknowns involve derivatives—into the Laplace domain, where we work with algebraic equations. We'll see how the Laplace transform converts derivatives into algebraic terms and incorporates initial conditions naturally.

        <title>Crossing Into the Laplace Domain</title>
        <p>
            We start by understanding why we transform differential equations into the Laplace domain. The main motivation is simplicity: by applying the Laplace transform, we replace derivatives with algebraic expressions, making it easier to solve for the unknown function.

            We'll first explore the basic mechanics and then practice transforming differential equations using the Laplace transform.

            Let's review how each term in a differential equation is handled by the Laplace transform. We'll see how derivatives are converted to powers of <m>s</m>, how initial conditions enter the equation, and how the right-hand side is transformed.

        <title>Table of Forward Transforms</title>
        <p>
            We can speed up the forward transform process using a table of standard Laplace transforms. These are the same transforms introduced in the previous chapter, now applied specifically to differential equations.
