			<introduction>
				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be challenging because there's no universal method that works for every type. The appropriate technique depends on features like the equation's order and whether it's linear. For example, the first method we'll study only applies to linear first-order equations. So before solving, it's important to check that the equation fits the method's requirements.

			<title> First-Order Differential Equations </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be complex because there is no one-size-fits-all technique for solving them. The method used depends on the characteristics of the specific equation, such as its order and linearity. For instance, one of the first techniques that we will explore can only be applied to linear, first-order equations. Therefore, it's important to first ensure that the equation meets the requirements of the chosen technique before attempting to solve it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						This chapter covers a solution technique called <em>separation of variables</em>, a powerful tool for solving first order differential equations that can be rearranged in a form where the independent and dependent variables can be isolated on opposite sides of the equation. In this new form, the general solution can be obtained by integrating both sides of the equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we will learn to identify when it is possible to put an equation in this special form and delve into the separation of variables process that leads to the general solution.

				<title> Integrating Factor </title>
	
				<introduction>
						<p>
							This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
						</p>

						<p>
							To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
							\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="di-eqn">
							\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function, called the <term>integrating factor</term>, that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.

			<title> Linear Equations With Constant Coefficients </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					As we delve deeper into the study of differential equations, we transition from first-order equations to those involving second derivatives and higher. These higher-order equations are essential for modeling complex systems in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In this part of the text, we focus on a particularly important class of differential equations known as <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>. We will explain what it means for a differential equation to have constant coefficients and introduce the concept of a homogeneous equation. Both of these will play a critical role in determining the types of solutions you should expect and the method you can use to solve for them.

				<introduction>

						In this chapter, we will define key terms such as <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Following that, we will explore systematic methods for finding the general solutions using the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to solve LHCC equations, providing a solid foundation for further study of their nonhomogeneous counterparts.

				<title> Nonhomogeneous Equations </title>

				<!-- <introduction>

					<p>
						In the previous chapter, we studied <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations had solutions composed of exponential functions, which we determined using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we generalize to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which have the form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
						a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
					</men>.
					
					<p>
						The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em>. As we will see, the general solution to these nonhomogeneous equations consist of the sum of two parts: The <em>homogeneous</em> and the <em>particular solutions</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Each part is defined by how their respective terms simplify when substituted into the left-hand side of the equation. In particular,
					</p>
					
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>homogeneous</em> terms simplify as like-terms to zero (i.e., cancel out), and
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>particular</em> terms simplify as like-terms to the function <m>f(x)</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						You are already familiar with the homogeneous solution from the previous chapter. The next step is to understand how solutions are composed. Specifically, we will investigate why the general solution must include both a homogeneous and a particular solution.
