				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be challenging because there's no universal method that works for every type. The appropriate technique depends on features like the equation's order and whether it's linear. For example, the first method we'll study only applies to linear first-order equations. So before solving, it's important to check that the equation fits the method's requirements.

			<title> First-Order Differential Equations </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be complex because there is no one-size-fits-all technique for solving them. The method used depends on the characteristics of the specific equation, such as its order and linearity. For instance, one of the first techniques that we will explore can only be applied to linear, first-order equations. Therefore, it's important to first ensure that the equation meets the requirements of the chosen technique before attempting to solve it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

				<introduction>

						This chapter covers a solution technique called <em>separation of variables</em>, a powerful tool for solving first order differential equations that can be rearranged in a form where the independent and dependent variables can be isolated on opposite sides of the equation. In this new form, the general solution can be obtained by integrating both sides of the equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we will learn to identify when it is possible to put an equation in this special form and delve into the separation of variables process that leads to the general solution.

				<title> Integrating Factor </title>
	
				<introduction>
						<p>
							This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
						</p>

						<p>
							To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
							\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="di-eqn">
							\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function, called the <term>integrating factor</term>, that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.

			<title> Linear Equations With Constant Coefficients </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					As we delve deeper into the study of differential equations, we transition from first-order equations to those involving second derivatives and higher. These higher-order equations are essential for modeling complex systems in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. 
				</p>

				<p>
					In this part of the text, we focus on a particularly important class of differential equations known as <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>. We will explain what it means for a differential equation to have constant coefficients and introduce the concept of a homogeneous equation. Both of these will play a critical role in determining the types of solutions you should expect and the method you can use to solve for them.

						In this chapter, we will define key terms such as <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Following that, we will explore systematic methods for finding the general solutions using the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to solve LHCC equations, providing a solid foundation for further study of their nonhomogeneous counterparts.

				<title> Nonhomogeneous Equations </title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In the previous chapter, we focused on <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side was always zero. These equations had solutions made up entirely of exponential functions, which we found using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we expand to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which follow the form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
						a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
					</men>.

					<p>
						The new feature is the presence of a non-zero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <term>forcing function</term>. This function represents external influences like forcing, inputs, or other effects driving the system.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unlike homogeneous equations, LNCC equations have solutions that include two distinct parts:
					</p>

					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>homogeneous solution</em>, which consists of terms that cancel out when substituted back into the equation.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>particular solution</em>, which produces the forcing function <m>f(x)</m> when substituted.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Together, these two components make up the <em>general solution</em>. Our first goal will be to understand this structure more clearly, before learning systematic techniques—like the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em>—for determining the particular solution <m>y_p</m>.

			<title> The Laplace Transform Method </title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The Laplace transform method is a powerful technique for solving differential equations by temporarily shifting the problem into a new setting called the <term>Laplace domain</term>. In this domain, the original differential equation—whose unknown is <m>y</m>—is transformed into an algebraic equation involving a new unknown, <m>Y</m>. The key advantage of this approach is that solving for <m>Y</m> algebraically automatically yields information about <m>y</m>. Once <m>Y</m> is determined, we reverse the process to recover the solution to the original equation.
				</p>

				<p>
					this method provides an alternative approach to solving <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>. It also allows us to handle more complex scenarios, such as equations with discontinuous forcing functions or initial conditions that are not easily managed by other methods.

This three-step process begins by transforming the differential equation into the Laplace domain (step 1).

				<title> Applying the Laplace Method </title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						The heart of the Laplace transform method lies in its ability to convert a differential equation into an algebraic equation. This transformation takes place in what we call the <em>Laplace domain</em> where derivatives are encoded in a variable \( s \) and initial conditions naturally appear as constants in the new equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we will walk through the steps of solving a differential equation using the Laplace transform method. Each step will be explained in detail using the following example:
						<men xml:id="lt-model-eqn-w-ics"> 
							y'' - 9y = 10e^{2t}, \quad y(0) = 1, \quad y'(0) = -7
						</men>.
						The previous chapter equipped you with the necessary tools to understand each step, but putting the pieces together can still be challenging. Let's begin with the following roadmap, which outlines big picture of the Laplace method.
