		<title>Interactive Differential Equations</title>
		<subtitle> An Active Approach to Methods &amp; Modeling </subtitle>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Welcome to the world of differential equations, where algebra and calculus blend together to form a powerful branch of mathematics that describes the dynamics of the world around us. Similar to equations you've seen in algebra, the goal of "differential equations" is to solve for an unknown. This time the equations contain one or more derivatives and the unknowns are functions, instead of numbers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Differential equations represent a powerful set of mathematical tools that describe how quantities change over time or space. They represent the language of change, growth, and dynamics in the world around us. From predicting the weather to understanding population dynamics, differential equations play a crucial role.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book will take you on a journey to explore the beauty and applications of differential equations. We will dive into the fundamental concepts, techniques, and methods used to solve these equations and analyze their behavior. Whether you are a mathematician, physicist, engineer, or just curious about the world around you, this book will equip you with the knowledge and skills to tackle real-world problems using differential equations.
			</p>
			
			<!-- <p>
				So, get ready to unlock the secrets of the universe and discover the hidden patterns that govern the dynamics of our world. Let's dive into the captivating realm of differential equations together!

				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be challenging because there's no universal method that works for every type. The appropriate technique depends on features like the equation's order and whether it's linear. For example, the first method we'll study only applies to linear first-order equations. So before solving, it's important to check that the equation fits the method's requirements.

			<!-- <introduction>
				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be complex because there is no one-size-fits-all technique for solving them. The method used depends on the characteristics of the specific equation, such as its order and linearity. For instance, one of the first techniques that we will explore can only be applied to linear, first-order equations. Therefore, it's important to first ensure that the equation meets the requirements of the chosen technique before attempting to solve it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

				<title>Qualitative Methods</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Finding an exact formula-like solution to a differential equation is often the gold standard. But in reality, many important equations simply can't be solved that way. The formulas are too complicated, or they don't exist at all. That doesn't mean we're stuck. Instead, we turn to <term>qualitative methods</term>, a collection of tools for understanding how solutions behave <em>without</em> solving for them explicitly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Qualitative methods shift the focus from <q>What's the formula?</q> to <q>What does the solution <em>do</em>?</q> They help us see whether solutions rise or fall, where they settle, and how they respond to changes in initial conditions—all by interpreting the structure of the equation itself.
					</p>

					<paragraphs><title>Analytical vs. Qualitative</title>
						<p>
							An <term>analytic</term> solution gives a precise expression like <m>y(t) = C e^{2t}</m>. A <term>qualitative</term> approach, on the other hand, describes the solution's shape, tendencies, and long-term trends without pinning down an explicit formula. Both have value, but qualitative methods open the door when analytic solutions are out of reach.
						</p>
					</paragraphs>

					<paragraphs><title>Why Qualitative?</title>
						<p>
							Many real-world models are too complex to solve exactly. Even when a solution exists, a formula might be so messy it hides the big picture. Qualitative tools—like slope fields, phase lines, and bifurcation diagrams—strip away the clutter and show the underlying behavior. By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to look at an equation like <me>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)</me> and say something meaningful about its solutions, even if you never write one down.

				<title>Numerical Methods</title>

				<!-- <introduction>

					<p>
						This chapter delves into the concepts of approximation and explores some of the basic algorithms used to generate the numerical solutions to various differential equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						Numerical methods are a collection of techniques used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. In this chapter, we will learn about some of the most common numerical methods used to solve differential equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						We will start by discussing Euler's method, a simple numerical technique for solving first-order ordinary differential equations. We will then move on to more advanced methods such as Runge-Kutta methods, which are used to solve higher-order differential equations and systems of differential equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						In practice, it is not uncommon to encounter a differential equations that is very difficult or even impossible to solve. For instance, consider the equation
						<men xml:id="riccati-eqn">
							y' = y^2 - x.
						</men>
						Though this equation may seem straightforward, the nonlinear term, <m>y^2</m>, makes solving it substantially more challenging. In fact, the solution <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is so complex, special functions were introduced to make it easier to represent.
						<fn>
							The solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is described by
							<me>
								y = \frac{ 3 x \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{4}{3}} \left( x \right) - c_1 J_{\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) + 2 J_{-\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) \right) + 2 c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}}\left( x \right) }{ (12 x)^{2/3} \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}} \left( x \right) + J_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(x \right) \right)}
							</me>
							where <m>J_n(x)</m> denotes a Bessel function defined as
							<me>
								J_n( x ) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \ \Gamma(m + n + 1)}\left( \frac{i}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^{2m + n}.
							</me>
						</fn>
					</p>

					<p>
						The reality is that the solutions to a large set of differential equations simply cannot be written in the form of a standard function (i.e., closed-form). Fortunately, there are ways to <q>substitute</q> the solution with an approximate solution, which are perfectly structured to be found by a computer.
					</p>

					<p>
						This section aims to explore the general concepts and terms used to describe the numerical methods covered in this chapter. By the end, you will have a solid grasp on many of the tools needed to implement the various algorithms that numerically solve differential equations.

					As we delve deeper into the study of differential equations, we transition from first-order equations to those involving second derivatives and higher. These higher-order equations are essential for modeling complex systems in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

				<p>
					In this part of the text, we focus on a particularly important class of differential equations known as <term>linear differential equations with constant coefficients</term>.

				<!-- <introduction>
					<p>
						In the previous chapter, we focused on <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side was always zero. These equations had solutions made up entirely of exponential functions, which we found using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we expand to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which follow the form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
						a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
					</men>.

					<p>
						The new feature is the presence of a non-zero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <term>forcing function</term>. This function represents external influences like forcing, inputs, or other effects driving the system.
					</p>

					<p>
						Unlike homogeneous equations, LNCC equations have solutions that include two distinct parts:
					</p>

					<ul marker="square">

							<p>

								The <em>particular solution</em>, which produces the forcing function <m>f(x)</m> when substituted.

			<chapter label="laplace-method-piecewise-forcing">
				<title>Laplace Method for Piecewise Functions</title>

				<!-- <introduction>
					<p>
						Piecewise inputs appear everywhere in real-world systems — machines switch on, circuits reset, forces pulse for only seconds. This chapter shows how to extend the Laplace transform method to handle those cases by writing piecewise forcing functions in <em>unit step form</em> and using special transform rules.
					</p>


		<p>
			Many physical systems behave in ways that are not smooth or continuous, they start and stop suddenly, shift directions, or turn on for limited periods of time. These kinds of abrupt behaviors are best described using <em>piecewise functions</em>, which assign different rules to different time intervals.
		</p>

		<p>
			When modeling such situations with differential equations, piecewise functions typically appear on the right-hand side, acting as inputs or forcing functions that switch behavior at specific moments. Consider, for instance, an electrical circuit whose current <m>i(t)</m> changes its driving voltage at predetermined intervals. This scenario might be described by an equation like:
			<me>
				\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2i(t)
				= \left\{
				\begin{array}{ll}
					1,	\amp 0 \le t \lt 2\\
					-1,	\amp 2 \le t \lt 4\\
					0,	\amp t \ge 4
				\end{array} \right.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The key is to represent each segment of the piecewise function using <em>unit step functions</em>. These are simple mathematical ON-OFF switches that let us write piecewise behavior in a single, concise formula. Once in unit step form, we can systematically apply Laplace transform rules and solve the equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, you'll learn how to rewrite piecewise functions using unit step notation, understand different types of switching behavior (ON, OFF, and ON-for-a-while), and convert any piecewise function into a form suitable for Laplace analysis. These tools will be essential for handling real-world systems with piecewise inputs.

			<title>Systems of Differential Equations</title>

			<introduction label="part4-intro">
				<p>
					In this part, we will explore systems of differential equations, which involve multiple equations that are interrelated. These systems can be linear or nonlinear, and they often arise in real-world applications where multiple variables interact with each other.
				</p>

				<p>
					We will start with first-order linear systems, which are the simplest type of systems. Then, we will move on to nonlinear systems, which are more complex and require different techniques for analysis and solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the end of this part, you will have a solid understanding of how to analyze and solve systems of differential equations, both linear and nonlinear. This knowledge will be invaluable in various fields, including physics, engineering, and applied mathematics.

			<chapter><title>First-Order Linear Systems</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Systems of differential equations are a collection of differential equations that are solved simultaneously.
					</p>

					<p>
						When we first learned about differential equations, we focused on single equations with one dependent variable. But what if we have multiple dependent variables? How do we handle systems of equations where each variable evolves over time?
					</p>

					<p>
						Many systems of differential equations can be understood as a collection of independent first-order equations. In this section, we will explore the foundations of systems of equations, starting with uncoupled systems and moving on to coupled systems. We will also introduce the concept of a phase plane, which is a tool for visualizing the behavior of systems.
