			We are now prepared to see how reversing the product rule helps solve a differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Suppose you're given:
		</p>

		<me>
			\ub{e^{6x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 6e^{6x} y}_{\text{expanded product rule?}} = -e^{6x}
		</me>.

		<p>
			The left-hand side resembles the kind of expression we just rewrote using the product rule in reverse. In fact, we can group it as:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{6x} y \right] = -e^{6x}
		</me>.

		<p>
			This form is much easier to work with since we can integrate both sides to solve for <m>y</m>. Let's walk through that process in a full example.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-example">
			<title>Reverse the Product Rule and Integrate</title>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Show that the differential equation
				<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE">
				e^{6x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 6e^{6x} y = -e^{6x}
				</men>
				can be rewritten as
				<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE-solution">
				\frac{d}{dx} [ e^{6x} y ] = -e^{6x}
				</men>.
				Then solve by integrating both sides.
			</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
			<p>
				The left-hand side looks like a product rule. Since <m>y</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> appear separately, try setting <m>g = y</m>. That gives:
			</p>

			<me>
				\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{6x}}}}\
				\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}} +
				(6e^{6x})
				\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
			</me>

			<p>
				Since <m>f' = [e^{6x}]' = 6e^{6x}</m>, the left-hand side is a complete derivative:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{6x} y \right] = -e^{6x}
			</me>

			<p>
				Now integrate both sides:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \int \frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{6x} y \right]\, dx \amp = \int -e^{6x}\, dx </mrow>
				<mrow> e^{6x} y \amp = -\frac{1}{6} e^{6x} + c </mrow>
				<mrow> y \amp = -\frac{1}{6} + c e^{-6x} </mrow>
			</md>

			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			This example shows the power of writing one side of the equation as a single derivative. But not all equations are this convenient. Often, we need to tweak the equation first, just like we sometimes "complete the square" in algebra to get a factored form. We'll explore that idea next.
