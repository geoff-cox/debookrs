	<book xml:id="main"><title> Interactive Differential Equations </title><subtitle>A Step-by-Step Approach to Methods &amp; Modeling</subtitle>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Welcome to the world of differential equations, where algebra and calculus blend together to form a powerful branch of mathematics that describes the dynamics of the world around us. Similar to equations you've seen in algebra, the goal of "differential equations" is to solve for an unknown. This time the equations contain one or more derivatives and the unknowns are functions, instead of numbers.
			</p>

			<p>
				Differential equations represent a powerful set of mathematical tools that describe how quantities change over time or space. They represent the language of change, growth, and dynamics in the world around us. From predicting the weather to understanding population dynamics, differential equations play a crucial role.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book will take you on a journey to explore the beauty and applications of differential equations. We will dive into the fundamental concepts, techniques, and methods used to solve these equations and analyze their behavior. Whether you are a mathematician, physicist, engineer, or just curious about the world around you, this book will equip you with the knowledge and skills to tackle real-world problems using differential equations.

			<introduction>

				<p>
					Solving differential equations can be complex because there is no one-size-fits-all technique for solving them. The method used depends on the characteristics of the specific equation, such as its order and linearity. For instance, one of the first techniques that we will explore can only be applied to linear, first-order equations. Therefore, it's important to first ensure that the equation meets the requirements of the chosen technique before attempting to solve it.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

			<chapter><title> Separation of Variables </title>
				
				<introduction>

					<p>
						This chapter covers a solution technique called <em>separation of variables</em>, a powerful tool for solving first order differential equations that can be rearranged in a form where the independent and dependent variables can be isolated on opposite sides of the equation. In this new form, the general solution can be obtained by integrating both sides of the equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we will learn to identify when it is possible to put an equation in this special form and delve into the separation of variables process that leads to the general solution.

			<chapter><title> Integrating Factor </title>
	
				<introduction>
						
						<p>
							This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
						</p>

						<p>
							To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
							\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
						</p>

						<men xml:id="di-eqn">
							\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
						</men>

						<p>
							Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.

		<part><title> Linear Constant Coefficient Differential Equations </title>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					Solving differential equations can become increasingly complex when dealing with higher-order derivatives. However, linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC equations) are notable for being more accessible and widely applicable across various scientific and engineering disciplines.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, we will define key terms such as <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Following that, we will explore systematic methods for finding the general solutions using the <em>characteristic equation</em>. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear understanding of how to solve LHCC equations, providing a solid foundation for further study of their nonhomogeneous counterparts.
				</p>

			</introduction>

			<chapter><title> Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficients Differential Equations </title>

				<introduction>
						
					<p>
						As you might expect, solving differential equations becomes more challenging as the order of the derivative increases. However, <term>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</term> (LHCC equations) are the exception since they are not only approachable, but also generalize well across many different disciplines in science and engineering.
					</p>

					<p>
						We will begin by identifying what makes an equation linear, homogeneous, and constant coefficient, ensuring a clear understanding of the terminology and structure. From there, we will develop systematic methods to find general solutions, leveraging the characteristic equation to determine the form of solutions. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid grasp of how to approach and solve LHCC equations, preparing you for further exploration into nonhomogeneous cases and applied problem-solving.

			<chapter><title> Undetermined Coefficients </title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						In the previous chapter, we studied <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations had solutions composed of exponential functions, which we determined using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we generalize to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which have the form:
					</p>

					<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
						a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
					</men>.
					
					<p>
						The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em>. As we will see, the general solution to these nonhomogeneous equations consist of the sum of two parts: The <em>homogeneous</em> and the <em>particular solutions</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						Each part is defined how their repective terms simplify when substituted into the left-hand side of the equation. In particular,
					</p>
					
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>homogeneous</em> terms simplify as like-terms to zero (i.e., cancel out), and
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								The <em>particular</em> terms simplify as like-terms to the function <m>f(x)</m>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						You are ready familiar with the homogeneous solution from the previous chapter. The focus of this chapter will be on finding the particular solution and understanding its role in the general solution.
