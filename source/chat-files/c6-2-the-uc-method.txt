	<subsection><title> Selecting Particular Solutions </title>
		<p>
			As discussed in the previous section, solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations involves finding a solution that satisfies the equation:
			<me>
				a_n y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2 y'' + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
			</me>.
			The challenge is that the terms on the left side need to combine in just the right way to match <m>f(x)</m> on the right. This means the form of the particular solution must resemble <m>f(x)</m> closely. When <m>f(x)</m> contains polynomial, exponential, or trigonometric (sine or cosine) terms, the particular solution should involve similar components.
		</p>

		<p>
			The specific function that accounts for <m>f(x)</m> on the right side is known as the <term>particular solution</term>, denoted <m>y_p</m>. The form of this solution depends on the type of function <m>f(x)</m> represents. To help select the correct form of <m>y_p</m>, refer to <xref ref="yp-forms-table"/>, which outlines the most common types of <m>f(x)</m> and their corresponding <m>y_p</m> forms.

			In this table, the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, <m>\alpha</m>, and <m>\beta</m> are assumed to be known, while <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc., need to be determined. We will explore how to determine these coefficients in the next section. For now, we are concerned with picking the correct form. Let's work through a few examples to solidify this process.
		</p>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - Single Form </title>
			Ignore for now
		</example>

		<p>
			When <m>f(x)</m> is a sum of multiple functions, each part of the sum contributes to the form of the particular solution. In these situations, we construct <m>y_p</m> by simply adding together the particular solutions corresponding to each term in <m>f(x)</m>. Let's look at an example to clarify this approach.
		</p>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - Sum of Forms </title>
			Ignore for now
		</example>

		<p>
			When <m>f(x)</m> involves products of functions, constructing <m>y_p</m> can become more involved. This is because multiplying terms may introduce extra coefficients that turn out to be unnecessary or redundant. In these cases, simplifying the solution to avoid duplication is essential. The following example illustrates this process.

	<subsection><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>

		<p>
			As discussed in the previous sections, the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, and the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. This relationship is expressed as:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p
			</me>.
			However, it is possible for the particular solution to contain terms that overlap with those in the homogeneous solution. When this occurs, parts of the particular solution can be absorbed into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that does not accurately match the nonhomogeneous term on the right-hand side of the equation. This section highlights this issue and provides a strategy to resolve it.
		</p>

		<p>
			To illustrate this, consider the LNCC equation:
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}
			</me>.
			Here, the homogeneous and particular solutions are:
			<me>
				y_h = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x}, \qquad y_p = A e^{3x}
			</me>.
			The problem arises when you observe that <m>Ae^{3x}</m> in <m>y_p</m> is similar to <m>c_2 e^{3x}</m> in <m>y_h</m>, causing the general solution to become:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x} + A e^{3x} = c_1 e^{x} + (c_2 + A) e^{3x}.
			</me>
			As a result, the particular solution effectively vanishes into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that fails to reflect the nonhomogeneous term <m>e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To address this, we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> until there are no overlapping terms between <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. In this example, multiplying <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> once is sufficient to make it independent of <m>y_h</m>. The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is:
			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<theorem><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					When the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, contains terms in common with the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by repeatedly multiplying the overlapping terms by <m>x</m> until <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> share no terms in common.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</theorem>

			Let's explore this adjustment process through a few examples.

	<subsection><title> Method Steps </title>

		<p>
			When solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation, selecting the correct form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, is just the beginning. The next step is determining the values of its unknown coefficients, such as <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. In this section, we'll explore how to compute these coefficients by substituting the guessed particular solution into the original equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's revisit the example we discussed earlier. Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="finding-yps-coefficients-de">
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</men>.
			We guessed that the particular solution would be linear, so we set
			<me>
				y_p = Ax + B
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our goal now is to determine the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. To do this, we substitute <m>y_p = Ax + B</m> into the original differential equation. Here's how it works:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> y_p = Ax + B \quad \implies \quad y_p' = A \quad \implies \quad y_p'' = 0 </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Substituting <m>y_p</m>, <m>y_p'</m>, and <m>y_p''</m> into <xref ref="finding-yps-coefficients-de"/> results in:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> 0 - 4A + 3(Ax + B) =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> -4A + 3Ax + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 3Ax -4A + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Next, we match the <m>x</m> coefficients and the constants on opposite sides of the equation,
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 3A	  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ -4A + 3B}}} =\amp\ 
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 9		  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ 0		 }}}
			</mrow>
		</md>.	

		<p>
			This gives us two equations to solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
		</p>
		
		<sidebyside widths="20% 35% 10% 15% 20%" valigns="top top middle top top">
			<p/>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>\text{🏵️}: \hspace{5.25em}	3A		\amp = 9</mrow>
					<mrow>\text{💎}: \qquad -4A + 3B	\amp = 0</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>
					\implies
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>	A \amp = 3</mrow>
					<mrow>	B \amp = 4</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			Thus, the particular solution is:
		</p>
		<me>
			y_p = 3x + 4
		</me>.

		<p>
			Regardless of <m>y_p</m>'s form, the process of finding the coefficients remains consistent:
			<ul marker="square">
				<li><p>Substitute the chosen <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Collect and match coefficients of like-terms on both sides of the equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Solve the resulting system to find <m>A, B, C, \ldots</m>.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is why the method is called the "method of undetermined coefficients." and the complete process is summarized as follows.
