	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous chapter, we studied <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations had solutions composed of exponential functions, which we determined using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this chapter, we generalize to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which have the form:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
			a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
		</men>.
		
		<p>
			The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em>. As we will see, the general solution to these nonhomogeneous equations consist of the sum of two parts: The <em>homogeneous</em> and the <em>particular solutions</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Each part is defined by how their respective terms simplify when substituted into the left-hand side of the equation. In particular,
		</p>
		
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>
				<p>
					The <em>homogeneous</em> terms simplify as like-terms to zero (i.e., cancel out), and
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					The <em>particular</em> terms simplify as like-terms to the function <m>f(x)</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			You are ready familiar with the homogeneous solution from the previous chapter. The focus of this chapter will be on finding the particular solution and understanding its role in the general solution.

	<section><title> Introduction to Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient Equations </title>
		<introduction>

			<p>
				To understand why the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation has two parts, we will consider the following second-order differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</me>.

			<p>
				Let's start with the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, which accounts for the <m>9x</m> on the right-hand side of the equation. We will then introduce the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, which accounts for the terms that cancel out when the solution is plugged into the differential equation.
			</p>
			
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> Why Particular Solutions Mirror the Forcing Function </title>

			<p>
				When solving nonhomogeneous differential equations, a key observation is that the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, often resembles the form of the nonhomogeneous term, <m>f(x)</m>, on the right-hand side of the equation. Understanding why this is the case helps us develop an efficient strategy for guessing <m>y_p</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Imagine you had to guess a function of <m>x</m> that satisfies the equation,
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</me>.

			<p>
				Any guess you make must have the property that
			</p>

			<me>
				(\text{guess})'' - 4(\text{guess})' + 3(\text{guess})\ \text{ simplifies to }\ 9x
			</me>.

			<p>
				For these terms to simplify to <m>9x</m>, the guess itself must have a similar structure as <m>9x</m>. Since the right-hand side is a degree-one polynomial, differentiation will never introduce higher-degree terms. Thus, it makes sense to guess a polynomial of the same degree.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's guess that the solution is of the form <m>y = Ax + B</m> and see if we can determine the coefficients <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	(Ax + B)'' - 4(Ax + B)' + 3(Ax + B)	\amp = 9x	</mrow>
				<mrow>	0 - 4(A) + 3(Ax + B)				\amp = 9x	</mrow>
				<mrow>	3Ax - 4A + 3B						\amp = 9x	</mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				To ensure that the left-hand side contains a term that matches <m>9x</m>, we set <m>A=3</m>, leading to:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	9x - 12 + 3B	\amp = 9x	</mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				For both sides of this equation to be equal, we need <m>-12 + 3B = 0</m>, which gives <m>B = 4</m>. Thus, using these values in our guess, we obtain the particular solution:
				<me>
					y = 3x + 4
				</me>,
				which simplifies to <m>9x</m> when plugged into the equation, shown below.
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	y = 3x+4: \quad (3x+4)'' - 4(3x+4)' + 3(3x+4)	\amp = 9x		  </mrow>
				<mrow>	0 - 12 + 9x + 12								\amp = 9x		  </mrow>
				<mrow>	9x												\amp = 9x \ \ ✅	</mrow>
			</md>.

			<p>
				The function <m>y = 3x+4</m> is the part of the general solution called the <term>particular solution</term>, whose sole purpose is to produce the <m>9x</m> on the right-hand side of the original equation.
			</p>

		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> General Solution to LNCC Equations </title>

			<p>
				In the previous subsection, we determined that the linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation
			</p>

			<men xml:id="lncc-example-eqn">
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</men>

			<p>
				has the particular solution <m>y_p = 3x + 4</m>. This function is special because, when substituted for <m>y</m>, it ensures that the left-hand side simplifies to <m>9x</m>, thus satisfying the equation. However, this <m>y_p</m> does not include possible terms that naturally cancel out when substituted into the left-hand side. In particular, it does not include the exponential terms that arise from solving the homogeneous equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				The solution to this equation, which we will denote <m>y_h</m>, is the other part of the general solution called the <term>homogeneous</term> or <term>complementary solution</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The structure of the general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions, and is summarized as follows:
			</p>

			<me>
				y = {\color{BurntOrange} y_h} + {\color{RoyalBlue} y_p} = 
				{\color{BurntOrange}
				\os{\large\text{Homogeneous Solution}}{
					\boxed{
					\begin{array}{c}
						\text{Terms of } y \text{ that }\\
						\ul{\text{cancel}} \text{ when } y \text{ is}\\
						\text{plugged into the DE}
					\end{array}}
				}} + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}
				\os{\large\text{Particular Solution}}{
					\boxed{
					\begin{array}{c}
						\text{Terms of } y \text{ that simplify}\\
						\text{to } \ul{f(x)} \text{ when } y \text{ is}\\
						\text{plugged into the DE}
					\end{array}}
				}}
			</me>

			<p>
				Let's see how this idea works in the context of equation <xref ref="lncc-example-eqn"/>.

			<p>
				This example confirms that while <m>y_p</m> produces <m>f(x)</m>, the full general solution requires the addition of <m>y_h</m> to include all possible solutions to the differential equation. It also supports the following concept about the structure of general solutions to LNCC equations.

			<p>
				Here's a quick example to help solidify this concept.

	<section><title> Method of Undetermined Coefficients </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we established that the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation consists of two parts: the <em>homogeneous solution</em> <m>y_h</m> and the <em>particular solution</em> <m>y_p</m>. While <m>y_h</m> is found by solving the characteristic equation of the corresponding homogeneous equation, finding <m>y_p</m> requires a different approach.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> is a systematic technique for determining <m>y_p</m> when the nonhomogeneous term, <m>f(x)</m>, has a specific form. Instead of solving for <m>y_p</m> directly, we first assume its general structure based on the form of <m>f(x)</m>, then determine the unknown coefficients by substituting <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation and solving for them.
			</p>

			<p>
				One limitation of this method is that it only works when <m>f(x)</m> is:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>A Polynomial, such as <m>f(x) = 2x^2 + x - 4</m></p></li>
				<li><p>An Exponential function, such as <m>f(x) = 5 e^{2 x}</m></p></li>
				<li><p>Sine or Cosine functions, such as <m>f(x) = \sin(\pi x) - 3\cos(\pi x)</m></p></li>
				<li><p>Any sum or product of these function types</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Nevertheless, when applicable, it provides a straightforward and efficient way to determine the general solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we will develop the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> by first identifying how to select an appropriate form for <m>y_p</m>, then learning how to modify <m>y_p</m> when it conflicts with <m>y_h</m>. Finally, we will apply the full method to solve LNCC equations step by step.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> Selecting Particular Solutions </title>

			<p>
				The first step in the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> is selecting an appropriate form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. Since <m>y_p</m> is responsible for generating the nonhomogeneous term <m>f(x)</m> when substituted into the differential equation, it must be structured in a way that allows differentiation to produce terms that match those in <m>f(x)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Unlike the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m>, which is determined by solving the characteristic equation, <m>y_p</m> is not obtained through direct computation. Instead, we assume a general form for <m>y_p</m> that mirrors the function type of <m>f(x)</m>, introducing unknown coefficients that will be determined later by substitution into the differential equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				The general principle for choosing <m>y_p</m> can be described as:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em>The particular solution <m>y_p</m> must have the same structure as <m>f(x)</m>, ensuring that differentiation produces terms capable of matching this function on the right-hand side.</em>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				This means that if <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial or exponential, for example, then <m>y_p</m> should take a similar form. The table below provides a guide for selecting <m>y_p</m> (<em>right column</em>) based on the type of forcing function, <m>f(x)</m> (<em>left column</em>). 
			</p>

			<aside>
				<p>
					The coefficients (<m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc.) will be found later by plugging <m>y_p</m> into our DE. For now, we are focused on selecting the correct form of <m>y_p</m>.

			<note><title> Include all possible terms in the selected form </title>
				<p>
					When you select a function type in the left column, make sure to include all terms in the right column even if <m>f(x)</m> lacks that term. For example:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							If <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m>, it may be tempting to set <m>y_p = Ax^2 + B</m> since <m>f(x)</m> lacks an <m>x</m> term. However, <m>y_p</m> must account for all degree 2 polynomial terms, including <m>x</m>. So, <m>y_p=Ax^2 + Bx + C</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Similarly, if <m>f(x) = \cos(3x)</m>, then <m>y_p = A\cos(3x) + \ul{B\sin(3x)}</m>! This ensures that differentiation produces all terms needed to match <m>f(x)</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</note>

			<p>
				If <m>f(x)</m> consists of a sum of different function types (e.g., a polynomial plus an exponential), the particular solution <m>y_p</m> must also be a sum of the corresponding forms. Each term in <m>y_p</m> should independently match its counterpart in <m>f(x)</m>.

				When <m>f(x)</m> is a product of function types (such as a polynomial times an exponential), <m>y_p</m> should be chosen as a product of their corresponding forms. The tricky part here is that multiplication often introduces unnecessary coefficients that can overly complicate your problem if not simplified. The next example illustrates this situation and addresses how to handle it.
			</p>

			<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - A Redundant Coefficient </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Use <xref ref="yp-forms-table"/> to determine the initial form of <m>y_p</m> for the equation
							<me>
								y'' + y' + 5y = 10x^2 e^{6x}
							</me>.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Since <m>f(x) = 10x^2 e^{6x}</m> is the product of a polynomial and an exponential, logically we would set <m>y_p</m> as
					</p>

					<me>
						y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x})
					</me>.

					<p>
						However, <m>D</m> is unnecessary because if we multiply this expression out, <m>D</m> can be absorbed into <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, as follows:
					</p>

					<me>
						y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x}) = \left(AD x^2 + BD x + CD\right) e^{6x}
					</me>.

					<p>
						So, relabeling <m>AD</m>, <m>BD</m>, and <m>CD</m> as <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, respectively, the form of <m>y_p</m> simplifies to:
					</p>

					<me>
						y_p = \left(A x^2 + B x + C\right) e^{6x}
					</me>.
				</solution>

			</example>

			<p>
				As this example demonstrates, creating a product of forms directly from the table can lead to redundant coefficients. To build some confidence with this process, here are a few more examples to practice this skill.

				Selecting the correct form of <m>y_p</m> is an important first step toward solving these nonhomogeneous equations. However, our chosen <m>y_p</m> might sometimes conflict with <m>y_h</m>, requiring modifications. In the next subsection, we explore how to handle these conflicts.
			</p>

		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> Modifying Particular Solutions </title>

			<p>
				In the previous subsection, we determined how to select an appropriate form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, based on the structure of <m>f(x)</m>. However, a problem occurs when <m>y_p</m> contains a term that also appears in <m>y_h</m>. If this happens, substituting <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation will fail to produce the correct right-hand side <m>f(x)</m>, requiring an adjustment.
			</p>

			<p>
				To illustrate this, consider the nonhomogeneous equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}
			</me>.

			<p>
				The homogeneous and initial particular solutions for this equation are given by:
			</p>

			<me>
				y_h = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x}, \qquad y_p = A e^{3x}
			</me>.

			<p>
				The problem is that <m>A e^{3x}</m> is already included in <m>y_h</m> as <m>c_2 e^{3x}</m>. This means that when <m>A e^{3x}</m> is substituted into the left-hand side of the equation, it satisfies the homogeneous equation, resulting in zero rather than generating the necessary <m>e^{3x}</m> term to match <m>f(x)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				To resolve this, we modify <m>y_p</m> to ensure it remains independent of <m>y_h</m>. The standard approach is to multiply the conflicting term in <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m>. If the overlap persists, we continue multiplying by <m>x</m> until all duplicate terms are removed. In this case, <m>y_p</m> becomes
			</p>

			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}
			</me>,

			<p>
				which has no terms in common with <m>y_h</m>. In general, we apply the following rule:
			</p>

			<assemblage xml:id="modifying-yp"><title> Modification Rule for the Particular Solution </title>
				<p> 
					If any term in <m>y_p</m> is also found in <m>y_h</m>, multiply that term in <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m>. If the modified term still appears in <m>y_h</m>, multiply by <m>x</m> again. Repeat this process until all overlapping terms are eliminated.
				</p>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				Now that we understand the need for modifying <m>y_p</m>, let's apply this adjustment rule to specific cases and observe how it ensures independence from <m>y_h</m>.

												The characteristic equation is:
											</p>
											<me>
												r^2 - 3r + 2 = 0.
											</me>
											<p>
												Factoring gives <m>(r - 1)(r - 2) = 0</m>, so the homogeneous solution is:

											<me>
												y_h = c_1 e^x + c_2 e^{2x}.

												<term> <xref ref="uc-step-2" text="title"/>. </term>
												Since <m>f(x) = 5e^{2x}</m>, we initially choose:
											</p>
											<me>
												y_p = A e^{2x}.
											</me>

											<p>
												<term> <xref ref="uc-step-3" text="title"/>. </term>
												However, <m>e^{2x}</m> appears in <m>y_h</m>, so we modify <m>y_p</m> by multiplying by <m>x</m>:
											</p>
											<me>
												y_p = A x e^{2x}.

												Compute derivatives and substitute into the differential equation:

											<me>

											</me>
											<me>
												y_p'' = 2A e^{2x} + 2A e^{2x} + 4Ax e^{2x}.
											</me>
											<p>
												Substituting into the equation and simplifying, we solve for <m>A</m> and find <m>A = 5/2</m>. Thus, the particular solution is:
											</p>
											<me>
												y_p = \frac{5}{2} x e^{2x}.
											</me>

											<p>
												<term> <xref ref="uc-step-5" text="title"/>. </term>
												The general solution is:
