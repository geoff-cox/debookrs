<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Units, Mass, Volume, Concentration</title>

<p>
We're about to start working on applications involving mixing solutions in tanks.
That means we need to be mindful of units (for example--we can't add miles and
kilograms), mass balance, and volumes. We also can develop some intuition that will
be helpful when we tackle more complicated questions.

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>
	Consider the equation <m>s \cdot X = d,</m>
	where <m>s</m> is a speed and has units of miles/hour. The variable <m>d</m>
	represents distance and	has units miles. What units must the variable <m>X</m> have?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	In order to make the unit analysis work,
	
		<me> \ub{s}_{\frac{\text{mi}}{\text{hr}}}\cdot \ub{X}_{?}	
															= \ub{d}_{\text{mi}}, 	</me>
		
		we would need <m>X</m> to have units of <term> hours</term>.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			hours
		</p>
	</answer>

	<li>
	<p>
	Consider the equation <m>A = B \cdot C,</m> where <m>A</m> has units of
	moles/hour and <m>B</m> has units of gallons/hour. What must the units of
	<m>C</m> be?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	In order to make the unit analysis work,
	
		<me> \ub{A}_{\frac{\text{moles}}{\text{hr}}}
						= \ub{B}_{\frac{\text{gal}}{\text{hr}}} \cdot \ub{C}_{?}, 	</me>
	
		we would need <m>C</m> to have units of <term> moles/gallon</term>.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			moles/gallon
		</p>
	</answer>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	Consider the equation <m>M - N\cdot P = Z,</m> where <m>M</m> has units of
	ft<m>\cdot</m>lb/sec, <m>N</m> has units of ft, <m>P</m> has units of lb/sec.
	What must the units of <m>Z</m> be?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	In order to make the unit analysis work,
		
		<me> \ub{M}_{\frac{\text{ft<m>\cdot</m>lb}}{\text{sec}}} - \ub{N}_{\text{ft}}
					 \cdot \ub{P}_{\frac{\text{lb}}{\text{sec}}} = \ub{Z}_{?}, 		</me>
		
		we would need <m>Z</m> to have units of <term> ft<m>\cdot</m>lb/sec</term>.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			ft<m>\cdot</m>lb/sec

	Consider the tank below, which has salt water solutions (also called brines)
	entering via two input lines (A and B) 	and has one output line (C).

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	If the tank level does not change, what volumetric flow rate must be leaving
	via the output line C?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Brine is entering the tank at volumetric flow rate
			
			<me> 4 \text{L/min} + 10 \text{L/min} = 14 \text{L/min}. </me>
			
		Since the tank level does not change, brine must leave at the same rate,
		<term> 14 L/min</term>.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			14 L/min
		</p>
	</answer>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	The concentration (in kg/L) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the figure.
	At what rate (in kg/min) is salt entering the tank?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate
			
			<me> 4 \frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \times 6 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}
												= 24 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}. 	</me>
		
		Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate
		
			<me> 10 \frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}} \times 4 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{L}}
												= 40 \frac{\text{kg}}{\text{min}}. 	</me>
		
		Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of <term> 64 kg/min</term>.

	<li>
	<p>
	If the tank level does not change, what volumetric flow rate must be entering via
	the input line B?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Brine is leaving the tank at volumetric flow rate 10 gal/sec. Inlet A
		contributes 4 gal/sec, which means that if the tank level is to remain
		constant, inlet B must contribute <term> 6 gal/sec</term>.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			6 gal/sec

	The concentration (in lb/gal) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the
	figure. Assuming the tank level doesn't change, at what rate (in lb/sec) is salt
	entering the tank?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate
			
			<me> 4 \frac{\text{gal}}{\text{sec}} \times
				0.5 \frac{\text{lb}}{\text{gal}} = 2 \frac{\text{lb}}{\text{sec}}. 	</me>
		
		Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate
		
			<me> 6 \frac{\text{gal}}{\text{sec}} \times
				4 \frac{\text{lb}}{\text{gal}} = 24 \frac{\text{lb}}{\text{sec}}. 	</me>
		
		Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of <term> 26 lb/sec</term>.

	What happens to the level of the tank over time? Be specific.
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Liquid is entering at a rate of 7+10 = 17 L/min. It leaves at a rate of
		12 L/min. That means that the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a
		rate of 5 L/min.
		</p>
	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			increases (volume increases at a rate of 5 L/min)

	</answer>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>
	If the tank has a capacity of 1500 L, and is empty at time <m>t = 0</m> minutes,
	write a function <m>V(t)</m> for volume of liquid in the tank at time <m>t</m>
	minutes.
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Since the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a rate of 5 L/min, we have
		
		<md>
			<mrow>V(t)	=\amp\ \ub{\text{(initial volume)}}_{L}
							+ \ub{\text{(rate)}}_{\frac{\text{L}}{\text{min}}}
								\times\ub{\text{(time)}}_{\text{min}}			</mrow>
			<mrow>		=\amp\ 0 + 5t											</mrow>	
		</md>
		
		Since the capacity of the tank is 1500 L, this equation only works for
		<m>0 \le t \le 300</m> minutes.

	Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of water that is dark red due to
	food coloring and that the liquid entering the tank is pure water. Imagine that
	we allow the pure water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of
	the tank for a <term> really</term> long time; you can think about it happening
	for years, if it helps. What color would you expect the water in the tank to be
	after a really long time?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Over time we would expect that the water in the tank is almost identical to
		the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the tank be clear (i.e., pure water).

	How much salt is initially in the tank?

	Initially we have

	the tank after a long time?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Initially we have salt in the tank, but over time, no salt is added but the
		solution is drained, so more and more salt leaves the tank. Over time we would
		expect that the concentration of salt would decrease to <term>0 lb/gal</term>.

	Imagine that we allow the brine to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain

	a long time?
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Over time we would expect that the fluid in the tank is almost identical to
		the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the concentration of salt to be

	How much salt do you expect to be in the tank after a long time? (Note that this
	is a slightly different than asking about the <em>concentration</em> of salt.
	Hint:  use units!)
	</p>
	<solution>
		<p>
	Since we expect the concentration to be  8 kg/L, and there are 50 L of
		solution in the tank (which	doesn't change because the volumetric flow rate
		in is equal to the volumetric flow rate out), then we expect there will be
