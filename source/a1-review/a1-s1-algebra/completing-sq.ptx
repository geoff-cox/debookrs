<title>Completing the Square</title>

<p>
	Completing the square is a powerful tool when faced with quadratic expressions that don’t immediately match any of the standard forms. For example, if you see a quadratic expression like <m>s^2 + 4s + 8</m>, you can use completing the square to rewrite it as something resembling <m>(s+a)^2 + b^2</m>. The key to recognizing when this technique is needed lies in the structure of the quadratic expression: if the quadratic has both linear and constant terms but cannot be factored easily, completing the square is often the next step.
</p>

<p>
	The strategy is straightforward: first, identify the coefficient of the linear term, then use it to complete the square. Specifically, given a quadratic of the form <m>s^2 + as + b</m>, you would take half of the linear coefficient, square it, and add and subtract it within the expression. This transforms the quadratic into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant, making it easier to handle in the context of Laplace transforms.
</p>


<p>
Completing the square will be necessary when finding the inverse Laplace transform 
of some rational functions. Recall that we use completing the square when we have 
a quadratic expression that isn't a perfect square, but we'd like to add the right 
number to it to make it a perfect square. We will also need to subtract the same 
number to compensate for what we added (so that we are effectively adding zero and 
not changing the value of the expression). Here's an example.

		As we progress through the Laplace Transform Method, the modifications required to match the s-function to a known form in the backward transform table become more intricate. One of the first major modifications we encounter is completing the square. This technique allows us to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a recognizable form that corresponds to the sine or cosine entries in the common Laplace transforms table.

		Completing the square is a powerful tool when faced with quadratic expressions that don’t immediately match any of the standard forms. For example, if you see a quadratic expression like <m>s^2 + 4s + 8</m>, you can use completing the square to rewrite it as something resembling <m>(s+a)^2 + b^2</m>. The key to recognizing when this technique is needed lies in the structure of the quadratic expression: if the quadratic has both linear and constant terms but cannot be factored easily, completing the square is often the next step.

		The strategy is straightforward: first, identify the coefficient of the linear term, then use it to complete the square. Specifically, given a quadratic of the form <m>s^2 + as + b</m>, you would take half of the linear coefficient, square it, and add and subtract it within the expression. This transforms the quadratic into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant, making it easier to handle in the context of Laplace transforms.

		Let's walk through a few examples to illustrate how completing the square can simplify the inverse Laplace transform process.
	</p>

	<example>
		<m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 + 6s + 10</m> by completing the square.
		
		<solution>
			<p>
				Start by taking half of the linear coefficient, <m>6/2 = 3</m>, and squaring it to get <m>9</m>. Then add and subtract <m>9</m> inside the expression:
				<md>
					s^2 + 6s + 10 = (s^2 + 6s + 9) + 1 = (s + 3)^2 + 1.
				</md>
				Now, the expression is in a form that matches the cosine or sine entries in the Laplace transform table.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 - 4s + 13</m> by completing the square.
		
		<solution>
			<p>
				Take half of the linear coefficient, <m>-4/2 = -2</m>, and square it to get <m>4</m>. Add and subtract <m>4</m>:
				<md>
					s^2 - 4s + 13 = (s^2 - 4s + 4) + 9 = (s - 2)^2 + 9.
				</md>
				This expression now matches the standard form for inverse Laplace transforms involving sine or cosine.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example>
		<m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 + 8s + 20</m> by completing the square.
		
		<solution>
			<p>
				Take half of the linear coefficient, <m>8/2 = 4</m>, and square it to get <m>16</m>. Add and subtract <m>16</m>:
				<md>
					s^2 + 8s + 20 = (s^2 + 8s + 16) + 4 = (s + 4)^2 + 4.
				</md>
				This allows you to apply the inverse Laplace transform for sine or cosine functions.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

		Completing the square is an essential technique for transforming quadratic expressions that don't directly match a form in the table of common Laplace transforms. However, it's not the only strategy available. In the next subsection, we'll explore another important technique: partial fraction decomposition. This method is useful for breaking down complex fractions into simpler components that can each be matched with forms in the Laplace transform table.
