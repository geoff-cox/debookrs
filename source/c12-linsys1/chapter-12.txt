In this section, we will explore the foundations of systems of equations, starting with uncoupled systems and moving on to coupled systems.

		<subsection label="what-are-systems"><title> What are Systems? </title>

			<p>
				Recall that a solution to a differential equation is a function that <xref ref="satisfying-a-de" text="custom">statisfies</xref> the equation. Up to now, there was always one equation  we talk about systems of differential equations, we mean a set of equations that describe how multiple dependent variables change over time. Each variable can depend on one or more independent variables, and they can interact with each other in various ways.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider a system with two dependent variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We might have equations like:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y) </mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				In this case, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are functions that describe how <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> change over time, potentially depending on each other.
			</p>
			<p>
				We can also have systems with more than two variables, like <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>. The equations might look like:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y, z) </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y, z) </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dz}{dt} = h(x, y, z) </mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				In this case, <m>f</m>, <m>g</m>, and <m>h</m> are functions that describe how each variable changes over time, potentially depending on all the other variables.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding systems of differential equations is crucial because many real-world phenomena involve multiple interacting variables. For example, in ecology, we might model the populations of predators and prey, where the growth of one population depends on the other. In physics, we might model the motion of multiple objects that influence each other's trajectories.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the next sections, we will explore how to solve these systems, starting with uncoupled systems and moving on to partially coupled and fully coupled systems. We will also introduce visualization tools like phase planes to help us understand the behavior of these systems.
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> How are they the Same </title>
				<p>
					At their core, systems of differential equations are just collections of first-order equations. Each equation describes how one dependent variable changes over time, potentially depending on other variables in the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, in a system with two variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we might have:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, y) </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} = g(x, y) </mrow>
				</md>
				<p>
					This is similar to a single first-order differential equation, but now we have two equations that can interact with each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					The key difference is that in a system, we have multiple dependent variables that can influence each other. This adds complexity but also allows us to model more realistic scenarios where multiple factors are at play.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just like with single equations, we can use techniques like separation of variables, integrating factors, and substitution to solve systems of differential equations. The solutions will give us functions that describe how each variable evolves over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Overall, systems of differential equations are a natural extension of the concepts we've already learned. They allow us to model more complex interactions and behaviors, making them a powerful tool in mathematics and science.
				</p>
				
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> How are they Different </title>

				<p>
					The main difference between systems of differential equations and single equations is the presence of multiple dependent variables that can interact with each other. In a single equation, we have one dependent variable that evolves over time based on its own rate of change. In a system, we have multiple dependent variables, each with its own rate of change, which can depend on the other variables in the system.
				</p>
				<p>
					This interaction can lead to more complex behaviors, such as oscillations, stability, and chaos, which are not present in single equations. For example, in a predator-prey model, the population of predators depends on the population of prey, and vice versa. This creates a dynamic relationship that can lead to oscillations in both populations over time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solving systems of differential equations often requires different techniques than solving single equations. We may need to use matrix methods, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors to analyze the stability and behavior of the system as a whole.
				</p>
				<p>
					In summary, systems of differential equations allow us to model more complex interactions between multiple dependent variables, leading to richer behaviors and requiring different solution techniques compared to single equations.

			<subsection label="uncoupled-systems"><title> Two Quantities - No Interaction </title>

				<p>
					The most basic system of differential equations is when there are two quantities Let's begin with a system of two first-order differential equations that actually have nothing to do with each other. There are two dependent variables, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, but they are separated into their own equations. For example, consider:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x	\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 0.6 </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 1.2 </mrow>
				</md>

				<p>
					These are called <em>uncoupled</em> because the <m>dx/dt</m> equation doesn't contain <m>y</m>, and the <m>dy/dt</m> equation doesn't contain <m>x</m>. There's no interaction between the variables.
				</p>

				<p>
					We already know how to solve each equation on its own. Individually, the solutions are:
				</p>

				<me>
					x(t) = 0.6 e^{-t}
					\quad \text{and} \quad
					y(t) = 1.2 e^{-2t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					However, we generally pair them as a point or vector, such as
				</p>

				<me>
					\left( x(t), y(t) \right) = \left( 0.6 e^{-t} , 1.2 e^{-2t} \right)
				</me>

				<p>
					Even though <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> evolve independently, we can still treat them as a <em>system</em>. Situations like this are more common than you'd think. For example, <m>x(t)</m> could model a cooling cup of coffee, while <m>y(t)</m> tracks a chilled soda warming up, both happening in the same room but without affecting each other.

				<p>
					In the previous example, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> changed independently. But what happens if one variable begins to influence the other? Let's explore a system where <m>x</m> evolves on its own, but <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x		\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 1 </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y + x	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
				</md>

				<p>
					This system describes how <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> change over time. <m>x</m> follows a simple decay, while <m>y</m> responds to the current value of <m>x</m>. We can think of <m>x</m> as a driving force and <m>y</m> as the response.
				</p>

				<p>
					The first equation is familiar, it's just exponential decay. We can solve it right away:
				</p>

				<me>
					x(t) = e^{-t}
				</me>

				<p>
					Once we know <m>x(t)</m>, the second equation becomes:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y + e^{-t}
				</me>

				<p>
					This is a first-order linear equation, which we can solve using an integrating factor.
				</p>

				<p>
					This is called a <em>partially coupled</em> system: <m>x</m> evolves on its own, while <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. It's a one-way interaction, <m>x</m> affects <m>y</m>, but not the other way around.
				</p>

				<exercise label="chkpt-building-up-to-systems-1-2-1"><title> Partial Coupling is One-Way </title>
					<statement correct="yes">
						<p>
							In a partially coupled system, one variable affects the other, but not vice versa.
						</p>
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>
							Exactly. In these systems, one equation is independent and can be solved first. The second equation depends on the first.
						</p>
					</feedback>
				</exercise>

				<p>
					This situation can model real-world problems where one process drives another. For example, suppose <m>x(t)</m> represents the light entering a greenhouse, and <m>y(t)</m> models plant growth. The light level doesn't depend on the plant, but the plant's growth rate depends on both its current state <m>y</m> and the incoming light <m>x</m>.
				</p>

				<example xml:id="ex-partial-coupling"><title> A Partially Coupled System </title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Solve the partially coupled system:
						</p>
						<md>
							<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt}	\amp = -x		\amp \text{with} \quad x(0) = 1 </mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = -2y + x	\amp \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
						</md>
					</statement>

					<solution>
						<p>
							This system is partially coupled: the equation for <m>x</m> is independent, while <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. We'll solve it in two steps.
						</p>

						<p><term>Step 1:</term> Solve the equation for <m>x</m>. This is exponential decay:</p>

						<me>
							\frac{dx}{dt} = -x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x(t) = e^{-t}
						</me>

						<p><term>Step 2:</term> Substitute <m>x(t)</m> into the equation for <m>y</m>:</p>

						<me>
							\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y + e^{-t}
						</me>

						<p>
							This is a linear equation. We'll solve it using an integrating factor. First, write it in standard form:
						</p>

						<me>
							y' + 2y = e^{-t}, \quad \mu(t) = e^{2t}
						</me>

						<p>
							Multiply both sides by the integrating factor:
						</p>

						<me>
							e^{2t} \cdot \frac{dy}{dt} + 2e^{2t} y = e^{t}
						</me>

						<p>
							The left-hand side is the derivative of <m>e^{2t} y</m>:
						</p>

						<me>
							\frac{d}{dt} \left( e^{2t} y \right) = e^t
						</me>

						<p>
							Integrate both sides:
						</p>

						<me>
							e^{2t} y = \int e^t\, dt = e^t + C
						</me>

						<p>
							Solve for <m>y(t)</m>:
						</p>

						<me>
							y(t) = e^{-t} + C e^{-2t}
						</me>

						<p>
							Use the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>:
						</p>

						<me>
							0 = 1 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = -1
						</me>

						<p>
							So the full solution is:
						</p>

						<me>
							\begin{aligned}
							x(t) \amp = e^{-t} \\
							y(t) \amp = e^{-t} - e^{-2t}
							\end{aligned}
						</me>

						<p>
							The function <m>x(t)</m> decays smoothly, while <m>y(t)</m> is temporarily lifted by <m>x(t)</m> before decaying to zero. This kind of response is typical in systems where one variable drives the other without feedback.

			<p>
				So far, we've seen examples of systems where variables evolve independently or influence each other. Now let's step back and look at how to visualize a system as a whole.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <em>phase plane</em> is a two-dimensional space where we plot one variable on the horizontal axis and the other on the vertical axis. A solution to a system like
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = -x </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -2y </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				becomes a curve in the <m>(x, y)</m> plane: a path that the system traces over time. We often call this a <em>trajectory</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Instead of plotting <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> separately, we visualize the pair <m>(x(t), y(t))</m> moving through the plane.
			</p>

			<p>
				To understand how the system behaves without solving it, we can draw a <em>slope field</em> or <em>direction field</em>: a grid of arrows showing the direction of motion at each point.
			</p>

			<p>
				Each arrow represents the vector <m>(dx/dt, dy/dt)</m> at a point <m>(x, y)</m>. Together, they show how the system wants to evolve.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="ex-slopefield-uncoupled">
				<title> Phase Portrait of an Uncoupled System </title>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the system:

				</md>
				<p>
					The phase portrait shows straight-line motion toward the origin along both axes, because each variable decays independently.
				</p>
				</statement>
			</example>

			<p>
				In more interesting systems, like partially coupled ones, the slope field reveals how the variables influence each other.
			</p>

					The phase portrait shows <m>x(t)</m> decaying, and <m>y(t)</m> temporarily increasing in response before decaying, reflecting the one-way interaction.

		<p>
			We've now seen two types of systems: uncoupled systems, where each variable evolves independently, and partially coupled systems, where one variable depends on the other. Now let's look at the final case: when <em>both</em> variables affect each other.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider this system:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x + y \quad \text{with} \quad x(0) = 2 </mrow>
			<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x - y \quad \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Both equations involve both variables. This is a <em>fully coupled</em> system, neither equation can be solved in isolation.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the previous section, we solved the system step-by-step because one equation was independent. That doesn't work here. Any change in <m>x</m> affects <m>y</m>, and <m>y</m> also influences <m>x</m>. The two variables evolve together, and we have to treat the system as a whole.
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, we don't yet have the tools to solve such a system exactly. But we can still learn a lot by thinking about what the equations say and by sketching their behavior.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="ex-fully-coupled-narrative">
			<title> A Fully Coupled System </title>
			<statement>
			<p>
				Consider the system:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x + y \quad \text{with} \quad x(0) = 2 </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x - y \quad \text{with} \quad y(0) = 0 </mrow>
			</md>
			</statement>
			<solution>
			<p>
				Since both equations involve both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, there's no way to solve one without the other. However, we can still describe how the system behaves.
			</p>

			<p>
				- When <m>y</m> is positive, it pushes <m>x'</m> higher and pulls <m>y'</m> lower.
				- When <m>y</m> is negative, the opposite happens.
				- When <m>x = y</m>, we get: <m>x' = 2x</m> and <m>y' = 0</m>, so the solution moves right along a horizontal path.
				- When <m>x = -y</m>, we get: <m>x' = 0</m> and <m>y' = -2y</m>, motion is vertical.
			</p>

			<p>
				If we graph this system as a vector field in the <m>(x, y)</m> plane, we'll see curved trajectories, possibly spiraling, possibly diverging. We'll explore these possibilities in more detail later.
			</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Even without a complete solution, it's helpful to study how a system behaves by looking at its direction field or using technology to plot solution curves.
		</p>

		<p>
			Later, we'll learn a method for solving systems like this exactly by using something called <em>eigenvalues</em>. But for now, it's important to recognize when a system is fully coupled and why it's fundamentally different from the types we've already seen.

		<subsection label="what-is-a-linear-system"><title> What Counts as a Linear System? </title>
			<p>
				In this chapter, we'll learn how to understand and solve systems of differential equations that are <em>linear</em>. But what exactly does that mean?
			</p>

			<p>
				A system of differential equations is called <em>linear</em> if all of the dependent variables and their derivatives appear in a linear way: no powers, no products of variables, and no nonlinear functions like <m>\sin(x)</m> or <m>e^y</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, this is a linear system:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = 2x + 3y </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x + y </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				Each equation is a linear combination of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. The coefficients (2, 3, -1, 1) are just numbers. This system is both linear and has <em>constant coefficients</em>, which is the case we'll focus on.
			</p>

			<p>
				In contrast, the following system is <em>not</em> linear:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = xy </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = y^2 - x </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				The first equation contains a product <m>xy</m>, and the second equation contains a square <m>y^2</m>. That makes this a <em>nonlinear</em> system, which we'll learn to analyze later using different techniques.
			</p>

			<p>
				Linear systems are a powerful class of systems to study because they're flexible enough to model real-world interactions, like population dynamics, circuits, or mechanical motion, and simple enough that we can often solve or analyze them exactly.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we'll focus entirely on linear systems with constant coefficients. These take the form:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = a_{11}x + a_{12}y </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = a_{21}x + a_{22}y </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				where the numbers <m>a_{ij}</m> are constants. Even though we're not yet using matrix notation, this structure sets the stage for powerful techniques that make systems easier to understand and solve.
			</p>

		<subsection label="solving-by-exponentials"><title> Solving a Linear System Using Exponentials </title>

			<p>
				When we first learned to solve constant-coefficient equations like <m>y' = ky</m>, we guessed that the solution would be an exponential function: <m>y(t) = Ce^{kt}</m>. That same idea works for linear systems.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose we're given the system:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = 3x + 4y </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -4x + 3y </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				Since the equations are linear with constant coefficients, we'll try guessing:
			</p>

			<me>
				x(t) = Ae^{rt}, \quad y(t) = Be^{rt}
			</me>

			<p>
				This guess assumes that both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> grow (or decay, or oscillate) at the same exponential rate <m>r</m>, but with possibly different coefficients <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's plug the guess into the system. First, compute:
			</p>

			<me>
				x' = Ar e^{rt}, \quad y' = Br e^{rt}
			</me>

			<p>
				Substituting into the system:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> Ar e^{rt} \amp = 3Ae^{rt} + 4Be^{rt} </mrow>
				<mrow> Br e^{rt} \amp = -4Ae^{rt} + 3Be^{rt} </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				Now divide both equations by <m>e^{rt}</m> (which is never zero) to get:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> Ar \amp = 3A + 4B </mrow>
				<mrow> Br \amp = -4A + 3B </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				This is a system of algebraic equations in <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, with <m>r</m> as a parameter. We can solve this by elimination or substitution, but really we're trying to find values of <m>r</m> that allow nontrivial solutions <m>(A, B) \ne (0, 0)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				That turns out to be an eigenvalue problem, which we'll fully explore soon, but for now, we'll give you the answer: the values of <m>r</m> that work here are <m>r = 3 \pm 4i</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				So the general solution to this system is a combination of complex exponentials:
			</p>

			<me>
				x(t), y(t) = \text{linear combinations of } e^{(3 + 4i)t},\ e^{(3 - 4i)t}
			</me>

			<p>
				These are spirals! The <m>3</m> in the exponent causes the solution to grow, and the <m>4i</m> causes it to rotate. If we plotted the solution curves in the <m>(x, y)</m> plane, we would see spirals moving outward from the origin.
			</p>

			<p>
				We'll return to the full method (and remove the mystery) when we introduce eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For now, it's enough to understand that we can solve linear systems by guessing exponentials, and that the result may involve both growth and oscillation.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="ex-spiral-system">
				<title> Behavior of a Spiral System </title>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the system:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = 2x + y </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x + 2y </mrow>
				</md>
				<p>
					Without solving, describe what you expect the phase portrait to look like.
				</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
				<p>
					The system has constant coefficients and is linear, so we expect exponential solutions. Based on the symmetry and signs in the equations, we can guess that the eigenvalues will be complex with a positive real part.
				</p>

				<p>
					That suggests spiral behavior moving outward from the origin. The system has a spiral source at the origin.
				</p>

		<subsection label="numerical-solutions-linear-systems"><title> Numerical Solutions and the Flow of Information </title>
			<p>
				What if you can't solve a system exactly, or you just want to understand what the solution looks like? One powerful option is to approximate the solution step by step. Let's see how that works for a linear system.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose we have the system:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x + y </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x + y </mrow>
			</md>

			<p>
				With initial conditions: <m>x(0) = 1</m>, <m>y(0) = 0</m>. We'll use Euler's Method to approximate <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m> for small steps of time.
			</p>

			<p>
				At each step, we estimate the new values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> using their current values and their derivatives:
			</p>

			<me>
				x_{\text{new}} = x + h \cdot (x + y), \quad y_{\text{new}} = y + h \cdot (-x + y)
			</me>

			<p>
				Try it with <m>h = 0.1</m>. At <m>t = 0</m>, we have:
			</p>

			<me>
				x_0 = 1, \quad y_0 = 0
			</me>

			<p>
				Then:
			</p>

			<me>
				x_1 = 1 + 0.1(1 + 0) = 1.1, \quad y_1 = 0 + 0.1(-1 + 0) = -0.1
			</me>

			<p>
				You can already see the feedback: <m>x</m> increases, <m>y</m> decreases in response to <m>x</m>, which then affects <m>x</m> again at the next step.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's do one more step:
			</p>

			<me>
				x_2 = 1.1 + 0.1(1.1 - 0.1) = 1.1 + 0.1(1.0) = 1.2, \quad y_2 = -0.1 + 0.1(-1.1 - 0.1) = -0.1 + 0.1(-1.2) = -0.22
			</me>

			<p>
				We can continue this process to build a full table or plot of <m>(x(t), y(t))</m>. Each step shows how the system evolves, one moment at a time.
			</p>

			<p>
				This method doesn't require solving equations, it only requires evaluating derivatives. And it works for any system, linear or nonlinear.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="ex-euler-steps-system">
				<title> Euler's Method Applied to a System </title>
				<statement>
				<p>
					Use Euler's method with step size <m>h = 0.2</m> to estimate the values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> at <m>t = 0.2</m> and <m>t = 0.4</m> for the system:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow> \frac{dx}{dt} \amp = y </mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x </mrow>
				</md>

				<p>With initial conditions <m>x(0) = 1</m>, <m>y(0) = 0</m>.</p>
				</statement>

				<solution>
				<p>
					Step 1: At <m>t = 0</m>, we have <m>x = 1</m>, <m>y = 0</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					<m>x_1 = 1 + 0.2(0) = 1</m>, <m>y_1 = 0 + 0.2(-1) = -0.2</m>
				</p>

				<p>
					Step 2: At <m>t = 0.2</m>, <m>x = 1</m>, <m>y = -0.2</m>:
				</p>

				<p>
					<m>x_2 = 1 + 0.2(-0.2) = 0.96</m>, <m>y_2 = -0.2 + 0.2(-1) = -0.4</m>
				</p>

				<p>
					So we estimate:
					<m>(x(0.2), y(0.2)) \approx (1, -0.2)</m>, <m>(x(0.4), y(0.4)) \approx (0.96, -0.4)</m>
				</p>
				</solution>
