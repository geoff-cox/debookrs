	<title>Interactions Between Variables</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the last section, we saw <em>uncoupled systems</em>, where each equation evolved completely on its own. 
			But many real-world systems aren't so tidy. Often one quantity affects another ‚Äî or they push on each other in both directions. 
		</p>
		<p>
			In this section, we'll step up the complexity: first looking at systems where one variable drives another, and then meeting the case where both variables interact fully.
		</p>

		<title>Partially Coupled Systems</title>

		<p>
			Suppose we have two variables, <m>x(t)</m> and <m>y(t)</m>, but this time <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>. 
			In other words, <m>x</m> evolves independently, while <m>y</m> <q>listens</q> to <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's an example:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = -x \qquad x(0) = 1</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -2y + x \qquad y(0) = 0</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Notice what's happening: <m>x</m> follows a simple exponential decay. 
			Meanwhile, <m>y</m> is influenced by two things ‚Äî its own decay and whatever value <m>x</m> has at the time. 
			This is called a <em>partially coupled</em> system: one-way interaction.

			<title>Solving a Partially Coupled System</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Solve the system:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = -x \qquad x(0) = 1</mrow>
					<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -2y + x \qquad y(0) = 0</mrow>
				</md>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					<term>Step 1:</term> Solve the independent equation for <m>x</m>.  
					This is a familiar exponential decay:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dx}{dt} = -x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x(t) = e^{-t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					<term>Step 2:</term> Substitute <m>x(t) = e^{-t}</m> into the <m>y</m>-equation:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = -2y + e^{-t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					This is a linear first-order equation. Use an integrating factor to solve:
				</p>

				<me>
					y' + 2y = e^{-t}, \qquad \mu(t) = e^{2t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					Multiply by <m>e^{2t}</m> and rewrite the left side as a derivative:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dt}\left(e^{2t} y \right) = e^{t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					Integrate:
				</p>

				<me>
					e^{2t} y = \int e^{t} dt = e^{t} + C.
				</me>

				<p>
					Solve for <m>y(t)</m>:
				</p>

				<me>
					y(t) = e^{-t} + C e^{-2t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					Use the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m>:
				</p>

				<me>
					0 = 1 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = -1.
				</me>

				<p>
					So the solution is:
				</p>

				<me>
					x(t) = e^{-t}, \qquad y(t) = e^{-t} - e^{-2t}.
				</me>

				<p>
					<m>x(t)</m> decays smoothly, while <m>y(t)</m> rises briefly (pulled by <m>x</m>) before eventually decaying as well.  
					This <q>one-way influence</q> is the hallmark of a partially coupled system.
				</p>

		<title>Fully Coupled Systems (Conceptual)</title>

		<p>
			We've seen systems where nothing interacts (uncoupled) and where one quantity drives another (partially coupled). 
			Now we reach the most intricate case: <em>fully coupled systems</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In a fully coupled system, <term>both</term> variables affect each other. 
			Neither equation stands alone ‚Äî any change in <m>x</m> alters <m>y</m>'s future, and <m>y</m> feeds back into <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x + y \qquad x(0) = 2</mrow>
			<mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = x - y \qquad y(0) = 0</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Here, <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are fully entangled ‚Äî you can't solve one without the other. 
			Instead of peeling off one equation at a time, we'll eventually treat the system as a single object.
