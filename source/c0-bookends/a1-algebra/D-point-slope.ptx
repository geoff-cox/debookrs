  <title>Writing the Equation of a Line in Point-Slope Form</title>

  <p>
    When asked for the general form for the equation of a line, most people give the familiar
    <me> y = mx + b </me>
    —the slope-intercept form. This is a great form, but there is another equally useful one, easy to remember if we recall the slope formula. 

    Given two points <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x, y)</m>, the slope of the line between them is:
    <me> m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1} </me>

    Rearranging gives:
    <me> m(x - x_1) = y - y_1 </me>

    or, more commonly written:
    <me> y - y_1 = m(x - x_1). </me>

    Sometimes it's useful to go one step further and solve for <m>y</m> by adding <m>y_1</m> to both sides:
    <me> y = m(x - x_1) + y_1. </me>
  </p>

  <example>
    <title>Writing a Line from Two Points</title>
    <statement>
      Given the points <m>(3, 7)</m> and <m>(-1, 2)</m>, (i) write the equation of the line through the points in point-slope form, and then (ii) solve for the dependent variable <m>y</m>.
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        First, compute the slope:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow> m \amp = \frac{2 - 7}{-1 - 3} = \frac{5}{4} </mrow>
      </md>

      <p>
        Now write the point-slope form:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow> y - y_1 \amp = m(x - x_1) </mrow>
      </md>

      <p>
        (i) Using either point:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow> y - 7 \amp = \frac{5}{4}(x - 3) \quad \text{OR} \quad y - 2 = \frac{5}{4}(x + 1) </mrow>
      </md>

      <p>
        (ii) Solve for <m>y</m>:
      </p>
      <md>
        <mrow> y \amp = \frac{5}{4}(x - 3) + 7 \quad \text{OR} \quad y = \frac{5}{4}(x + 1) + 2 </mrow>
      </md>
    </solution>
  </example>

    <title>Practice Writing Equations of Lines</title>

        <p>
          Find the slope:
          <me> m = \frac{-1 + 9}{6 - 2} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 </me>

          (i) Write the point-slope form:
          <me> y + 1 = 2(x - 6) </me>

          (ii) Solve for <m>y</m>:
          <me> y = 2(x - 6) - 1 </me>
