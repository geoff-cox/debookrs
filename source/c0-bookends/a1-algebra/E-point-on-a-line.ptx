	<title>Finding a point on a line</title>

	<p>
	<em> Example:</em>  Consider the line <m>L</m> with equation
		<me> y - 3 = -2(x-5). </me>
		Find the coordinates of the point that lies on <m>L</m> and that has <m>x</m>-value <m>x = 6.</m>

		<answer>
		
			Here we can simply substitute in <m>x = 6</m> and then solve for the <m>y</m>-coordinate:
				<md><mrow>	y - 3	\amp = -2(6-5)</mrow>
								<mrow>y-3	\amp = -2</mrow>
								<mrow>y	\amp = 1</mrow>
					</md>
			So the desired point is <m>(6,1)</m>.
	</answer>
</p>
<p>
<em> Use the given equation of the line in point slope form to find the point on that line with
	the given $x$-value.</em>

			<p>
  <m>y - 1 = 3(x - 9),</m>  <m>x = 2</m> 		
	<solution>
		<p>
	We simply substitute in <m>x = 2</m> and then solve for the <m>y</m>-coordinate:
			 <md><mrow>	y - 1	\amp = 3(2 - 9)</mrow>
		<mrow>y - 1	\amp = -21</mrow>
		<mrow>y	\amp = -20</mrow>
	</md>
		So the desired point is <m>(2,-20)</m>.

	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			<me> (2,-20) </me>

  <m>y + 3 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 1),</m>  <m>x = 2</m>		
	<solution>
		<p>
	We simply substitute in <m>x = 2</m> and then solve for the <m>y</m>-coordinate:
			 <md><mrow>	y + 3	\amp = \frac{1}{2}(2 - 1)</mrow>
		<mrow>y + 3	\amp = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
		<mrow>y	\amp = \frac{1}{2} - 3</mrow>
		<mrow>y	\amp = -\frac{5}{2}</mrow>
	</md>
		So the desired point is <m>\ds \left(2,-\frac{5}{2}\right)</m>.

	</solution>
	<answer>
		<p>
			<me>  \left(2,-\frac{5}{2}\right) </me>

			<p>
  <m>y + 1 = 7x,</m>  <m>x = -1</m>		
	<solution>
		<p>
	We simply substitute in <m>x = -1</m> and then solve for the <m>y</m>-coordinate:
			 <md><mrow>	y + 1	\amp = 7(-1)</mrow>
		<mrow>y + 1	\amp = -7</mrow>
		<mrow>y	\amp = -8</mrow>
	</md>
		So the desired point is <m>(-1,-8)</m>.

	</solution>
	<answer>
