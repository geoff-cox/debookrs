	<title>Function Notation</title>

	<p>
	Function notation is a cornerstone of modern mathematics and science. It allows us to describe relationships between variables in a compact, precise, and flexible way. While the concept may seem familiar, mastering its nuances is essential for understanding differential equations and the systems they model.
	</p>

	<p>
	A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output value to each input. For example, <m>f(x) = x^2</m> takes an input <m>x</m>, squares it, and returns the result. The notation <m>f(x)</m> not only names the function but also reminds us which variable it depends on.
	</p>

	<p>
	In the context of differential equations, function notation frequently appears with derivatives—expressions like <m>f'(x)</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> describe how a quantity changes. These are the building blocks for modeling motion, population growth, heat flow, electrical current, and countless other processes.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="function-notation-example-1">
	<title>Evaluating a Function</title>
	<p>
		Suppose <m>f(x) = 2x + 3</m>. To find <m>f(4)</m>, substitute <m>x = 4</m>:
	</p>
	<me>f(4) = 2(4) + 3 = 11.</me>
	<p>
		This tells us that when the input is 4, the function outputs 11.
	</p>
	</example>

	<p>
	Function notation also makes it easy to represent more complex relationships. For instance, in the differential equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y)</m>, we describe how the rate of change of <m>y</m> depends both on the independent variable <m>x</m> and the dependent variable <m>y</m> through two separate functions.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="function-notation-example-2">
	<title>Function Composition</title>
	<p>
		Consider <m>f(x) = \sin(x)</m> and <m>g(y) = e^y</m>. The composition <m>g(f(x))</m> means we evaluate <m>f(x)</m> first, then plug the result into <m>g</m>:
	</p>
	<me>g(f(x)) = e^{\sin(x)}.</me>
	<p>
		This compact notation is especially useful in modeling layered or dependent processes.
	</p>
	</example>

	<p>
	Initial conditions often appear alongside function notation in differential equations. For example, if <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x</m> and <m>y(0) = 5</m>, the function <m>y(x)</m> must satisfy both the differential equation and this initial value.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="function-notation-example-3">
	<title>Function Notation in Initial Value Problems</title>
	<p>
		Solve the initial value problem:
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x, \qquad y(1) = 4.</me>
		First, find the general solution:
		<me>y(x) = x^2 + C.</me>
		Now use the initial condition:
		<me>4 = 1^2 + C \quad \Rightarrow \quad C = 3.</me>
		So the particular solution is:
		<me>y(x) = x^2 + 3.</me>
	</p>
	</example>

	<p>
	Function notation also plays a central role in the structure of higher-order differential equations, where derivatives and coefficients are expressed using functional relationships.
	</p>

	<p>
	Consider the general form:
	<me>\frac{d^n y}{dt^n} + a(t)y = k(t).</me>
	This describes how a function <m>y(t)</m> evolves over time, incorporating both its derivatives and time-dependent coefficients. Let’s break down the components.
	</p>

	<paragraphs xml:id="function-notation-components">
	<title>Key Components of Function Notation</title>

	<p>
		1. <term>The Function</term>: <m>y = y(t)</m> indicates that <m>y</m> is a function of time <m>t</m>. For example, <m>y(t)</m> might represent the temperature at time <m>t</m>, or the position of an object in motion.
	</p>

	<p>
		2. <term>Derivatives</term>: The term <m>\frac{d^n y}{dt^n}</m> refers to the <m>n</m>th derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>t</m>. Derivatives describe how a quantity changes. For example:
		<ul marker="square">
		<li><m>\frac{dy}{dt}</m> is the rate of change (velocity).</li>
		<li><m>\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m> is the second derivative (acceleration).</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		3. <term>Coefficients and Forcing Terms</term>: The functions <m>a(t)</m> and <m>k(t)</m> modify the behavior of the system. For example:
		<ul marker="square">
		<li><m>a(t)y</m> scales the function <m>y(t)</m> based on time.</li>
		<li><m>k(t)</m> represents an external input or forcing term.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	</paragraphs>

	<paragraphs xml:id="interpreting-equations">
	<title>Interpreting an Equation</title>

	<p>
		Let’s analyze this second-order differential equation:
		<me>\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 5\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = 10e^{-t}.</me>
		<ul marker="square">
		<li><m>\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m> is the second derivative—how fast the rate of change is changing.</li>
		<li><m>5\frac{dy}{dt}</m> is a damping term proportional to velocity.</li>
		<li><m>6y</m> scales the function itself.</li>
		<li><m>10e^{-t}</m> is a forcing term that decays over time.</li>
		</ul>
		These components together describe a system with internal resistance and an external influence.
	</p>

	<p>
		When interpreting a differential equation, ask:
		<ul marker="square">
		<li>What is the order of the highest derivative?</li>
		<li>Are the coefficients constant or variable?</li>
		<li>Is there a forcing term (like <m>k(t)</m>) driving the system?</li>
		</ul>
		These questions help you understand the system’s structure and behavior.
	</p>
	</paragraphs>

	<example xml:id="function-notation-example-4">
	<title>Breaking Down an Equation</title>
	<p>
		Consider:
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = 3x^2y.</me>
		This is a first-order differential equation. The rate of change of <m>y</m> depends on both <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. We can separate the variables:
		<me>\frac{1}{y} \, dy = 3x^2 \, dx.</me>
		Recognizing this structure makes it easier to solve.
	</p>
	</example>

	<p>
	In summary, function notation is more than a way to write formulas—it’s a powerful language for describing change. It allows us to interpret, analyze, and solve differential equations across a wide range of applications.
