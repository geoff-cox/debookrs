			A <term>rational function</term> is a function that is the division of two polynomials.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the following are rational functions in the variables <m>s</m>, <m>x</m>, and <m>t</m>, respectively:
			<me>
				\frac{s^2 + 3s + 2}{s - 1}, \quad \frac{2x^3 - 5x + 7}{x^2 - 4}, \quad \frac{1}{t^2 + 1}
			</me>.
