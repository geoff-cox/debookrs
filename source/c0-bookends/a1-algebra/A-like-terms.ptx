		<statement>
			<p>
				Terms are called <term>like-terms</term> if they have identical variable parts. That is, they differ only by a coefficient. like-terms can be combined via addition and subtraction. For example, the <m>x^2</m> and <m>e^{-3x}</m> terms below are pairs of like-terms, which can be combined as follows:
				<md>
					<mrow> \underline{3x^2} + \underline{\underline{5e^{-3x}}} - 2 + \underline{7x^2} - \underline{\underline{4e^{-3x}}}</mrow>
					<mrow> \underline{10x^2} + \underline{\underline{e^{-3x}}} - 2 </mrow>
				</md>.
