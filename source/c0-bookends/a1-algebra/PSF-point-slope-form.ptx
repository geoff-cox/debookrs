	<title>Equation of a Line in Point-Slope Form</title>

	<p>
		You’ve likely encountered the familiar slope-intercept form <m>y = mx + b</m> for the equation of a line. While this form is helpful, there’s another version that plays a more direct role in differential equations: the <term>point-slope form</term>. It’s especially useful when we know a point on the line and the slope, which is exactly the situation we encounter in slope fields and Euler’s method.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall the formula for the slope between two points, <m>(x_1, y_1)</m> and <m>(x, y)</m>:
		<me>m = \frac{y - y_1}{x - x_1}</me>
		Rearranging this gives the point-slope form of a line:
		<me>y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This form is powerful when modeling rates of change. For instance, when approximating solutions to differential equations numerically, each step follows the slope of a tangent line—exactly what this formula captures. You can also solve for <m>y</m> if needed:
		<me>y = m(x - x_1) + y_1</me>
	</p>

		<title>Writing a Line from Two Points</title>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Given the points <m>(3, 7)</m> and <m>(-1, 2)</m>:
				<ol>
					<li>Write the equation of the line in point-slope form.</li>
					<li>Solve the equation for <m>y</m>.</li>
				</ol>				
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>First, find the slope:</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>m \amp = \frac{2 - 7}{-1 - 3} = \frac{-5}{-4} = \frac{5}{4}</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>Now plug into the point-slope form using either point:</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>y - 7 \amp = \frac{5}{4}(x - 3) \quad \text{or} \quad y - 2 = \frac{5}{4}(x + 1)</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>Solving for <m>y</m> gives:</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>y \amp = \frac{5}{4}(x - 3) + 7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{5}{4}(x + 1) + 2</mrow>
		</md>
		</solution>
