	<title>Finding a Point on a Line</title>
	<p>
		Once we have an equation for a line—especially in point-slope form—we can easily find any point on that line by substituting in a value for <m>x</m> and solving for <m>y</m>. This is a basic but important skill when working with solutions to differential equations. For example, when using Euler’s method or interpreting a slope field, we often want to know the value of the solution at a particular <m>x</m>-value.
	</p>

	<example>
		<title>Finding a Point Given <m>x</m></title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The line <m>L</m> is given by the equation:
				<me>y - 3 = -2(x - 5)</me>
				Find the coordinates of the point on <m>L</m> with <m>x = 6</m>.
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Substitute <m>x = 6</m> into the equation and solve for <m>y</m>:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>y - 3 \amp = -2(6 - 5)</mrow>
			<mrow>y - 3 \amp = -2</mrow>
			<mrow>y \amp = 1</mrow>
		</md>
		<p>So the desired point is <m>(6, 1)</m>.</p>
		</solution>
		<answer><p><me>(6, 1)</me></p></answer>
	</example>

	<p>
		Use the given equation of a line in point-slope form to find the point on the line with the specified <m>x</m>-value.

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<m>y - 1 = 3(x - 9)</m>,  <m>x = 2</m>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
				Substitute <m>x = 2</m>:
				</p>
				<md>
				<mrow>y - 1 \amp = 3(2 - 9)</mrow>
				<mrow>y - 1 \amp = -21</mrow>
				<mrow>y \amp = -20</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>So the point is <m>(2, -20)</m>.</p>
			</solution>
			<answer><p><me>(2, -20)</me></p></answer>

		<exercise>
			<statement>
				<m>y + 3 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)</m>,  <m>x = 2</m>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
				Substitute <m>x = 2</m>:
				</p>
				<md>
				<mrow>y + 3 \amp = \frac{1}{2}(2 - 1)</mrow>
				<mrow>y + 3 \amp = \frac{1}{2}</mrow>
				<mrow>y \amp = \frac{1}{2} - 3 = -\frac{5}{2}</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>So the point is <m>\left(2, -\frac{5}{2}\right)</m>.</p>
			</solution>
			<answer><p><me>\left(2, -\frac{5}{2}\right)</me></p></answer>

				Substitute <m>x = -1</m>:
				</p>
				<md>
				<mrow>y + 1 \amp = 7(-1)</mrow>
				<mrow>y + 1 \amp = -7</mrow>
				<mrow>y \amp = -8</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>So the point is <m>(-1, -8)</m>.</p>
