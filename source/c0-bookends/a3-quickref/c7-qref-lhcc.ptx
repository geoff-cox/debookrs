		In this subsection, we developed a framework for solving <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations</em>. We began by exploring why <em>exponential functions</em> serve as the fundamental solutions to these equations, using the concept of <em>like-terms</em> to justify their role. 
	</p>

	<p>
		We then introduced the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into solving a polynomial equation. This method allows us to systematically determine the correct set of fundamental solutions for any LHCC equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		With this foundation in place, we are now ready to introduce a powerful tool for systematically finding these solutions: the <em>characteristic equation</em>. This algebraic approach allows us to determine the exponential solutions efficiently and will serve as the backbone of our solution methods moving forward.
	</p>

	<p>
		To build intuition, we will carefully examine the three defining properties of LHCC equations: <term>linearity</term>, <term>homogeneity</term>, and <term>constant coefficients</term>. Each of these characteristics influences the types of solutions that emerge and dictates the methods we use to solve them. By clearly defining and identifying LHCC equations, we lay the groundwork for developing powerful solution techniques in the sections that follow.
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a highly structured solution method. Their solutions take on a predictable form, allowing us to develop a systematic approach for solving them. Through examples and analysis, we will discover that <em>exponential functions</em> play a central role in solving LHCC equations. By assuming solutions of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m> and substituting into the equation, we obtain an algebraic equation for <m>r</m>, the <em>characteristic equation</em>. The solutions to this characteristic equation directly determine the general solution to the differential equation.

		The key takeaways from this subsection are:
	</p>

	<ul marker="square">
		<li> <em>Exponential functions</em> naturally emerge as solutions to LHCC equations due to their unique differentiation properties.</li>
		<li> The <em>characteristic equation</em> provides a systematic way to determine the fundamental solutions.</li>
		<li> The <em>general solution</em> consists of all independent exponential solutions, each multiplied by an arbitrary constant.</li>
		<li> The number of solutions matches the <em>order</em> of the differential equation.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In summary, a differential equation is classified as an LHCC equation if it satisfies three criteria:
	</p>
	
	<ul marker="square">
		<li>It is <em>linear</em>: each term involves <m>y</m> or its derivatives to the first power only.</li>
		<li>It is <em>homogeneous</em>: the right-hand side is zero.</li>
		<li>It has <em>constant coefficients</em>: the coefficients of <m>y</m> and its derivatives do not depend on <m>x</m>.</li>
	</ul>
