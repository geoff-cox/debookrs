	<p>
		The simplest type of differential equation to solve is one that you encountered many times in your calculus class whenever you were asked to find an anti-derivative of a function. For example, suppose you wanted the anti-derivative of <m>x^2</m>. If you remember from calculus, this is the same as asking: "What function, when differentiated, gives you <m>x^2</m>?" or
		<me>\frac{d}{dx}\Big[\quad ? \quad \Big] = x^2</me>,
		but this is just the differential equation
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2</me>
		where you must solve for <m>y</m>.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Even though we already know that the anti-derivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>\displaystyle \frac13 x^3 + C</m>, we will walk through how it would be solved as a differential equation. To prepare, review the following concepts from calculus.
	</p>

	<lemma>
		<statement>
			<p>
				All of the expressions below are equivalent ways to represent the derivative of a function <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>. 
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}[y] = \frac{dy}{dx} = y^\prime </me>
			</p>
		</statement>
	</lemma>

	<lemma>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The indefinite integral (i.e. anti-derivative) of the derivative of a function is the function itself, up to a constant. That is, 
				<men xml:id="integral-of-dy">\displaystyle\int\frac{dy}{dx}\ dx = y + C</men>,
				or
				<men xml:id="integral-of-df">\displaystyle\int\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]\ dx = f(x) + C</men>.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve the differential equation
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2 </me>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>

			<p>
				First note that our differential equation is equivalen  Recall that solving a differential equation involves isolating <m>y</m>. In this context, you can think of <m>y</m> as being "trapped" inside the derivative <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. Calculus allows us to "remove" <m>y</m> from the derivative via integration. So, let's integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to get
				<md>
					<mrow> \int\frac{dy}{dx}\ dx \amp = \int x^2\ dx</mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\overset{<xref ref="integral-of-dy"/>}{\hookrightarrow}\qquad 
						y + C_1    \amp = \frac13 x^3 + C_2
					</mrow>.
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we isolate <m>y</m> and combine constants.
				<md>
				<mrow>  y \amp = \frac13 x^3 + C_2 - C_1 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since <m> C_2 - C_1 </m> is still a constant, we combine it into a single constant, <m>C</m>, and write our solution as
				<me>
				y = \frac13 x^3 + C
				</me>
			</p>

		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		This example may seem like overkill for such a simple problem, but it illustrates the basic idea of solving a differential equation that we will use throughout this text. The process always involves isolating the dependent variable, in this case <m>y</m>, on one side of the equation and writing it as a function of the independent variable, <m>x</m>, and possibly some constants.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="di-method-02"><title> Solve by Direct Integration </title>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve the differential equation
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big] = \cos x </me>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			
			<p>
				To solve the differential equation 
				<me>\frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big] = \cos x</me>, 
				we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to get
				<md>
					<mrow> \int \frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big]dx \amp = \int \cos x\ dx</mrow>
					<mrow> y\sin(2x) + C_1 \amp = \sin x + C_2 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we isolate <m>y</m> and combine constants.
				<md>
					<mrow>  y\sin(2x) \amp = \sin x + \underset{=\ C}{\underbrace{C_2 - C_1}} </mrow>
