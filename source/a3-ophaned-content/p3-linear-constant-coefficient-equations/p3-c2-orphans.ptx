			We can write this solution as
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p
			</me>. 
			Substituting this into the equation and separating the <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> parts gives
			<md>
				<mrow> (y_h + y_p)'' + 2(y_h + y_p)' + 3(y_h + y_p) =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
				<mrow> y_h'' + y_p'' - 4y_h' - 4y_p' + 3y_h + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
				<mrow> y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h + y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p =\ &amp; 9x </mrow>
				<mrow> 
					\us{\Large y_h \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h)}}} 
					+ \
					\us{\Large y_p \text{ part }}{{\ub{(y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p)}}} 
					=\ &amp; 9x 
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Notice that each part looks like we separately plugged <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> into the left side of <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>. Now, suppose the <m>y_h</m> part simplified to <m>0</m> and the <m>y_p</m> part gave you <m>9x</m>, then the sum of these parts still equal <m>9x</m>. This  of <m>y_h</m> as the parts of the solution that cancel out with each other and <m>y_p</m> as the parts that simplify to <m>9x</m> (like in the previous section).
		</p>

		<p>
			We can get these two parts by separately solving the equations,
			<me>
				y_h'' - 4y_h' + 3y_h = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad
				y_p'' - 4y_p' + 3y_p = 9x
			</me>,
			for <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. Adding these together gives the general solution, <m>y = y_h + y_p</m>. The next example summarizes this process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Verifying that, say <m>y=e^{3x}+e^{4x}</m>, is a solution to the homogeneous equation
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 0
			</me>,
			involves plugging it into the left-hand side of the equation and simplifying. If it is a solution, then you would expect all the terms to cancel out, leaving you with zero so that the equation is satisfied. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In the case of a nonhomogeneous equation, 
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</me>,
			you would instead expect the left side to simplify to <m>9x</m> after plugging in a solution. Let's brainstorm some functions that might simplify to <m>9x</m>. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Since we need the left side to simplify to <m>9x</m>, it seems reasonable to consider functions that have <m>x</m> terms, such as polynomials. Let's try some below.

			There is a lot built into this result, so let's carefully break it down. 
			<ul marker="square">
				<li>
					<p>
						First, <m>y=e^{3x} + 3x + 4</m> is a solution since it satisfies <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The solution contains the two parts
						<me>
							y=\us{(1)}{\ul{e^{3x}}} + \us{(2)}{\ul{3x + 4}}
						</me>,
						where part (1) contains the terms that simplifies to <m>0</m> and part (2) contains the terms that simplify to <m>9x</m> when plugged into <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						The third step looks like <m>e^{3x}</m> and <m>3x+4</m> were separately plugged into <xref ref="lncc-eqn1"/>. As long as the equation is linear, this separation can happen.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<men>
			\underset{\text{terms that cancel}}{\underbrace{a_2 y_h'' + a_1 y_h' + a_0 y_h}} + 
			\underset{\text{terms that account for } f(x)}{\underbrace{a_2 y_p'' + a_1 y_p' + a_0 y_p}} = f(x)
		</men>

		
		<p>
			Now, let's attempt <xref ref="def-linear"/> to find a particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. Since the right-hand side of the original equation is <m>e^{3x}</m>, we might initially guess:
			<me>
				y_p = A e^{3x}
			</me>
			However, this term <m>e^{3x}</m> is already part of the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>. If we use this guess, we will not obtain a valid particular solution because it will be absorbed into the homogeneous part. To circumvent this, we adjust our guess by multiplying by <m>x</m> to ensure linear independence:
			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's verify if this adjusted guess works by plugging it into the original equation. We find the necessary derivatives:
			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}
			</me>
			<me>
				y_p' = A e^{3x} + 3A x e^{3x}
			</me>
			<me>
				y_p'' = 6A e^{3x} + 9A x e^{3x}
			</me>
			Substituting these into the differential equation:
			<me>
				(6A e^{3x} + 9A x e^{3x}) - 4(A e^{3x} + 3A x e^{3x}) + 3(A x e^{3x}) = e^{3x}
			</me>
			Simplifying, we get:
			<me>
				(6A e^{3x} + 9A x e^{3x}) - (4A e^{3x} + 12A x e^{3x}) + (3A x e^{3x}) = e^{3x}
			</me>
			<me>
				(6A e^{3x} - 4A e^{3x}) + (9A x e^{3x} - 12A x e^{3x} + 3A x e^{3x}) = e^{3x}
			</me>
			<me>
				2A e^{3x} + 0 = e^{3x}
			</me>
			This simplifies to:
			<me>
				2A e^{3x} = e^{3x}
			</me>
			Thus, we find:
			<me>
				A = \frac{1}{2}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Therefore, the particular solution is:
			<me>
				y_p = \frac{1}{2} x e^{3x}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This example demonstrates the importance of adjusting the form of <m>y_p</m> when it overlaps with <m>y_h</m>. In general, if our initial guess for <m>y_p</m> contains any term that is also part of <m>y_h</m>, we multiply that term by <m>x</m> to ensure independence. If the overlap persists, we multiply by higher powers of <m>x</m> (e.g., <m>x^2</m>, <m>x^3</m>) until the terms are linearly independent.

				<!-- <p> -->

				<me>y'' - 4y' - 12y = 3{e^{5t}}</me>
			</statement>
			  <solution><title> Solution </title>
	<p>
					The point here is to find a particular solution, however the first thing that we're going to do is find the homogeneous solution to this differential equation.  Recall that the homogeneous solution comes from solving,
					<me>y'' - 4y' - 12y = 0</me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The characteristic equation for this differential equation and its roots are.
					<me>
						{r^2} - 4r - 12 = \left( {r - 6} \right)\left( {r + 2} \right) = 0\hspace{0.25in} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.25in}\,\,{r_1} =  - 2,\,\,\,\,{r_2} = 6
					</me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The homogeneous solution is then,
					<me>
						{y_c}\left( t \right) = {c_1}{{\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}} + {c_2}{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}
					</me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					At this point the reason for doing this first will not be apparent, however we want you in the habit of finding it before we start the work to find a particular solution.  Eventually, as we'll see, having the homogeneous solution in hand will be helpful and so it's best to be in the habit of finding it first prior to doing the work for undetermined coefficients.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, let's proceed with finding a particular solution.  As mentioned prior to the start of this example we need to make a guess as to the form of a particular solution to this differential equation.  Since <me>g(t)</me> is an exponential and we know that exponentials never just appear or disappear in the differentiation process it seems that a likely form of the particular solution would be
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}</me>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Now, all that we need to do is do a couple of derivatives, plug this into the differential equation and see if we can determine what <me>A</me> needs to be.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Plugging into the differential equation gives
					<md>
						<mrow>
							25A{{\bf{e}}^{5t}} - 4\left( {5A{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}} \right) - 12\left( {A{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}} \right) &amp;  = 3{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}
						</mrow>
						<mrow>
							- 7A{{\bf{e}}^{5t}} &amp; = 3{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					So, in order for our guess to be a solution we will need to choose <me>A</me> so that,
					<me> 
						- 7A = 3\hspace{0.25in} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.25in}A =  - \frac{3}{7}
					</me>
					Okay, we found a value for the coefficient.  This means that we guessed correctly.  A particular solution to the differential equation is then,
					<me>
						{Y_P}\left( t \right) =  - \frac{3}{7}{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}
					</me>
				</p>
</solution>
		</example>
	
		<example>
			<statement>
				<!-- <p> -->
					Solve the following initial value problem.
				<!-- </p> -->
				<me>y'' - 4y' - 12y = 3{e^{5t}}\hspace{0.25in}\hspace{0.25in}y\left( 0 \right) = \frac{{18}}{7}\hspace{0.25in}y'\left( 0 \right) =  - \frac{1}{7}</me>
			</statement>
			
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					We know that the general solution will be of the form,
				</p>
					<me>y\left( t \right) = {y_c}\left( t \right) + {Y_P}\left( t \right)</me>
	
				<p>
					and we already have both the homogeneous and particular solution from the first example so we don't really need to do any extra work for this problem.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to find the homogeneous solution and then, because we're probably in the habit of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the homogeneous solution to find the constants.  This however, is incorrect.  The homogeneous solution is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the homogeneous solution.</p>
				
				<p>
					So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation.  Taking the homogeneous solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example we get the following for a general solution and its derivative.</p>
					
					<md>
						<mrow>y\left( t \right) &amp;  = {c_1}{{\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}} + {c_2}{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} - \frac{3}{7}{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}</mrow>
						<mrow>y'\left( t \right) &amp; =  - 2{c_1}{{\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}} + 6{c_2}{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} - \frac{{15}}{7}{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}</mrow>
					</md>
				
				<p>
					Now, apply the initial conditions to these.</p>
					<md>
						<mrow>\frac{{18}}{7} = y\left( 0 \right) &amp;  = {c_1} + {c_2} - \frac{3}{7}</mrow>
						<mrow>- \frac{1}{7} = y'\left( 0 \right) &amp; =  - 2{c_1} + 6{c_2} - \frac{{15}}{7}</mrow>
					</md>
				
				<p>
					Solving this system gives <me>c_{2} = 1</me>.  The actual solution is then.</p>
					<me>y\left( t \right) = 2{{\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}} + {{\bf{e}}^{6t}} - \frac{3}{7}{{\bf{e}}^{5t}}</me>

			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					Again, let's note that we should probably find the homogeneous solution before we proceed onto the guess for a particular solution.  However, because the homogeneous differential equation for this example is the same as that for the first example we won't bother with that here.</p>
				
					<p>Now, let's take our experience from the first example and apply that here.  The first example had an exponential function in the <me>g(t)</me> and our guess was an exponential.  This differential equation has a sine so let's try the following guess for the particular solution.</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A\sin \left( {2t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>Differentiating and plugging into the differential equation gives,</p>
				
					<me> - 4A\sin \left( {2t} \right) - 4\left( {2A\cos \left( {2t} \right)} \right) - 12\left( {A\sin \left( {2t} \right)} \right) = \sin \left( {2t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>Collecting like terms yields</p>
				
					<me> - 16A\sin \left( {2t} \right) - 8A\cos \left( {2t} \right) = \sin \left( {2t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>We need to pick <me>A</me> so that we get the same function on both sides of the equal sign.  This means that the coefficients of the sines and cosines must be equal.  Or,</p>
				
					<md>
	<mrow><mrow> &amp;  \cos \left( {2t} \right)\,: &amp;  - 8A &amp; = 0\hspace{0.25in} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.25in}A = 0</mrow> &amp; \sin \left( {2t} \right)\,:&amp;  - 16A &amp; = 1\hspace{0.25in} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.25in}A =  - \frac{1}{{16}}</mrow>
	</md>
				
				<p>Notice two things.  First, since there is no cosine on the right hand side this means that the coefficient must be zero on that side.  More importantly we have a serious problem here.  In order for the cosine to drop out, as it must in order for the guess to satisfy the differential equation, we need to set <me>A</me> to keep the sine around will also keep the cosine around.</p>
				
				<p>What this means is that our initial guess was wrong.  If we get multiple values of the same constant or are unable to find the value of a constant then we have guessed wrong.</p>
				
				<p>One of the nicer aspects of this method is that when we guess wrong our work will often suggest a fix.  In this case the problem was the cosine that cropped up.  So, to counter this let's add a cosine to our guess.  Our new guess is</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A\cos \left( {2t} \right) + B\sin \left( {2t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>Plugging this into the differential equation and collecting like terms gives,</p>
				
					<md>
						<mrow> - 4A\cos \left( {2t} \right) - 4B\sin \left( {2t} \right) - 4\left( { - 2A\sin \left( {2t} \right) + 2B\cos \left( {2t} \right)} \right) - \\ 12\left( {A\cos \left( {2t} \right) + B\sin \left( {2t} \right)} \right) </mrow>

					Once, again we will generally want the homogeneous solution in hand first, but again we're working with the same homogeneous differential equation (you'll eventually see why we keep working with the same homogeneous problem) so we'll again just refer to the first example.

				<p>
					For this example, <me>g(t)</me> is a cubic polynomial.  For this we will need the following guess for the particular solution.

						<p>We will start this one the same way that we initially started the previous example.  The guess for the polynomial is</p>
						
							<me>A{t^2} + Bt + C</me>
						<p>and the guess for the cosine is</p>

						<p>If we multiply the two guesses we get.</p>
						
							<me>\left( {A{t^2} + Bt + C} \right)\left( {D\cos t + E\sin t} \right)</me>
						
						<p>Let's simplify things up a little.  First multiply the polynomial through as follows.</p>
						
							<me>\begin{array}{c}\left( {A{t^2} + Bt + C} \right)\left( {D\cos t} \right) + \left( {A{t^2} + Bt + C} \right)\left( {E\sin t} \right)\\  \left( {AD{t^2} + BDt + CD} \right)\cos t + \left( {AE{t^2} + BEt + CE} \right)\sin t\end{array}</me>
						
						<p>Notice that everywhere one of the unknown constants occurs it is in a product of unknown constants.  This means that if we went through and used this as our guess the system of equations that we would need to solve for the unknown constants would have products of the unknowns in them.  These types of systems are generally very difficult to solve.</p>
						
						<p>So, to avoid this we will do the same thing that we did in the previous example.  Everywhere we see a product of constants we will rename it and call it a single constant.  The guess that we'll use for this function will be.</p>
						
							<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = \left( {A{t^2} + Bt + C} \right)\cos t + \left( {D{t^2} + Et + F} \right)\sin t</me>
						
						<p>This is a general rule that we will use when faced with a product of a polynomial and a trig function.  We write down the guess for the polynomial and then multiply that by a cosine.  We then write down the guess for the polynomial again, using different coefficients, and multiply this by a sine.</p>

				g\left( t \right) = 4\cos \left( {6t} \right) - 9\sin \left( {6t} \right)
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>This first one we've actually already told you how to do.  This is in the table of the basic functions.  However, we wanted to justify the guess that we put down there.  Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give.</p>
			  
					<me>\underbrace {A\cos \left( {6t} \right) + B\sin \left( {6t} \right)}_{{\mbox{guess for the cosine}}} + \underbrace {C\cos \left( {6t} \right) + D\sin \left( {6t} \right)}_{{\mbox{guess for the sine}}}</me>
			  
					<p>So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from each guess.  The problem with this as a guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns.  We will never be able to solve for each of the constants.</p>
					
					<p>To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as follows.</p>
					
					<me>\left( {A + C} \right)\cos \left( {6t} \right) + \left( {B + D} \right)\sin \left( {6t} \right)</me>
					
					<p>
						Upon doing this we can see that we've really got a single cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may as well just use</p>
					
						<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A\cos \left( {6t} \right) + B\sin \left( {6t} \right)</me>
					
					<p>
						The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms with single coefficients.  This will greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients.</p>

	</md>
				
				<p>All we did was move the 9.  However, upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a quadratic polynomial and a sine.  The guess for this is then</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A{t^2} + Bt + C + D\cos \left( {3t} \right) + E\sin \left( {3t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>If we don't do this and treat the function as the sum of three terms we would get</p>
				
					<me>A{t^2} + Bt + C + D\cos \left( {3t} \right) + E\sin \left( {3t} \right) + G</me>
				<p>and as with the first part in this example we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same (the <me>G</me>) and so would need to be combined.  An added step that isn't really necessary if we first rewrite the function.</p>

					<p>So, this look like we've got a sum of three terms here.  Let's write down a guess for that.</p>
				
					<me>A{{\bf{e}}^t} + \left( {Bt + C} \right){{\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}} + D{{\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}</me>
				
				<p>Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same and would need to be combined.  This is a case where the guess for one term is completely contained in the guess for a different term.  When this happens we just drop the guess that's already included in the other term.</p>
				
				<p>So, the guess here is actually.</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A{{\bf{e}}^t} + \left( {Bt + C} \right){{\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}</me>
				
				<p>Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our <me>g(t)</me> whose only difference was the polynomial that sat in front of them.  When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree polynomial, write down the guess for that and don't bother writing down the guess for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first guess.</p>

			<li><title>f</title>
				g\left( t \right) = {t^2}\cos t - 5t\sin t

					<p>In this case we've got two terms whose guess without the polynomials in front of them would be the same.  Therefore, we will take the one with the largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that one and ignore the other term.  So, the guess for the function is</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = \left( {A{t^2} + Bt + C} \right)\cos t + \left( {D{t^2} + Et + F} \right)\sin t</me>

				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>This last part is designed to make sure you understand the general rule that we used in the last two parts.  This time there really are three terms and we will need a guess for each term.  The guess here is</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A{{\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}} + {{\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}}\left( {B\cos \left( {6t} \right) + C\sin \left( {6t} \right)} \right) + D\cos \left( {6t} \right) + E\sin \left( {6t} \right)</me>
				
				<p>We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to the constant.  So, we can't combine the first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different functions.  Likewise, the last sine and cosine can't be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are different.</p>

				<p>
					This problem seems almost too simple to be given this late in the section.  This is especially true given the ease of finding a particular solution for <me>t</me>)'s that are just exponential functions.  Also, because the point of this example is to illustrate why it is generally a good idea to have the homogeneous solution in hand first we'll let's go ahead and recall the homogeneous solution first.  Here it is,
				</p>
				<p><me>{y_c}\left( t \right) = {c_1}{{\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}} + {c_2}{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</me>
				
				</p><p>Now, without worrying about the homogeneous solution for a couple more seconds let's go ahead and get to work on the particular solution.  There is not much to the guess here.  From our previous work we know that the guess for the particular solution should be,</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</me>
				
				<p>Plugging this into the differential equation gives,</p>

	<mrow>36A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} - 24A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} - 12A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} <mrow> &amp;  = {{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</mrow>  0 &amp; = {{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</mrow>
	</md>
				<p>Hmmmm….  Something seems wrong here.  Clearly an exponential can't be zero.  So, what went wrong?  We finally need the homogeneous solution. Notice that the second term in the homogeneous solution (listed above) is exactly our guess for the form of the particular solution and now recall that both portions of the homogeneous solution are solutions to the homogeneous differential equation,</p>
				
					<me>y'' - 4y' - 12y = 0</me>
				
				<p>In other words, we had better have gotten zero by plugging our guess into the differential equation, it is a solution to the homogeneous differential equation!</p>
				
				<p>So, how do we fix this?  The way that we fix this is to add a <me>t</me> to our guess as follows.</p>
				
					<me>{Y_P}\left( t \right) = At{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</me>
				
				<p>Plugging this into our differential equation gives,</p>
				
					<md>
						<mrow> \left( {12A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} + 36At{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}} \right) - 4\left( {A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} + 6At{{\bf{e}}^{6t}}} \right) - 12At{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} </mrow>

						<mrow> 8A{{\bf{e}}^{6t}} &amp; = {{\bf{e}}^{6t}}</mrow> 
					</md>
				
				<p>Now, we can set coefficients equal.</p>
				
				<me>8A = 1\hspace{0.25in}\hspace{0.25in} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.25in}\,\,\,\,\,A = \frac{1}{8}</me>
				<p>So, the particular solution in this case is,</p>

			<statement>
				Why do we adjust the particular solution <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> when solving LNCC equations?
			</statement>
			<answer>
				We adjust <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> to ensure that the particular solution does not share any terms with the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m>. This adjustment makes <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> independent, ensuring that the general solution properly represents the nonhomogeneous term of the differential equation.

			<statement>
				In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> play, and why is it important that they are independent?
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					<m>y_h</m> represents the solution to the homogeneous equation (where the nonhomogeneous term is zero), while <m>y_p</m> represents a particular solution that accounts for the nonhomogeneous term. It is important that they are independent so that their combined terms accurately reflect the behavior of both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts of the original differential equation.
