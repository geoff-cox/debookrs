		<exercise><title> <em>What are the dependent and independent variable in this case?</em> </title>
			<p>
				In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = <m>I</m>, and time = <m>t</m>.  For this discussion, let's assume time is in days.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since the number of infected, <m>I</m>, changes according to how much time, <m>t</m>, has	passed, then <m>I</m> depends on <m>t</m>. Therefore, <m>I</m> would the dependent variable and <m>t</m> would be the independent variable.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be
				<me>I(t) = \text{some function of } t</me>.
				Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time.  Now, let's say we have the solution, <m>I</m>, plug <m>t=10</m>	into it, and see the following:
				<me> I(10) = 30. </me>
				This result would be interpreted as "after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected".
			</p>
		
		
			<p>
				Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.
			</p>
	
		</exercise>
	
		<exercise><title> <em>What is one value for the number of infected we should know?</em> </title>
	
			<p>
				Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we	know
				<me>I(0) = 12</me>.

			<answer> particular solution </answer>
		
		</exercise>

		<p>
			To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points of the previous section that will be useful in this section.
			<ul>
			<li>
				The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.
			</li>
			<li>
				All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of possible solutions we called a family of solutions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<remark xml:id="sect-01-04-01-remark-01">
			<p>
			Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is equal to the order of the differential equation<m>^{1}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is illustrated in ? since <m>y'' - y' - 12y = 0</m> is of 2nd order and the general solution, <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m>, has 2 constants, <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
			</p>
		</remark>
		
		<aside>
			<p>
			<m>^{1}</m> There are some exceptions when working with nonlinear DEs.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			When you <q>solve</q> a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). [?] shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the <m>t, y</m>-plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Suppose we want the solution to the differential equation 
			<me> \displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 2ty - 6t, \quad y(0) = 2 </me>.
			Etcept for the initial condition, this is the same equation we solved in the previous section, which has the general solution 
			<men xml:id="p1-c2-s5-example-1">y = ce^{t^2} + 3</men>. 
			The initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, tells us that "<m>y</m> must equal 2 when <m>t</m> is 0". When we substitute <m>y=2</m> and <m>t=0</m> into <xref ref="p1-c2-s5-example-1" />, we see that we can solve for <m>c</m>.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow> y =  ce^{t^2} + 3 \quad \overset{y\ =\ 2,\ t\ =\ 0}{\Rightarrow} \quad	2	=\amp\  ce^{0^2} + 3	</mrow>
				<mrow>							 												2	=\amp\  c + 3		</mrow>
				<mrow>																			-1	=\amp\  c			</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Therefore, <m>y(0) = 2</m> forces <m>c = -1</m> and we get the particular solution
			<me>y = -e^{t^2} + 3</me>.
			In <xref ref="initial-conditions-figure-1" /> can see the initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, as the point <m>(0,2)</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.
		</p>
	
		<sidebyside widths="46% 2% 50%" margins="0%">
			<stack>
				<p>
					In the graph, the point on the <m>y</m>-axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the <m>y</m>-axis.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					As you drag the point, make the following observations:
				</p>
	
				<ul marker="square">
					<li> 
						Each new value of <m>y(0)</m> gives a new value of <m>c</m>, which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve). 
					</li>
					<li> 
						Only one particular solution from the family of solutions (green curves) passes through the initial condition.  
					</li>
				</ul>

			<m>\ \ </m> Solve the differential equation <m>\ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x. </m>
	
			<solution>
	
				<p>
					The general solution to this differential equation is
					<me> y = Ce^{x^2} + 3. </me>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					To find the specific value of <m>C</m>, we need to use an initial condition. Let's say we know that <m>y(0) = 0</m>. This means that when <m>x = 0</m>, then <m>y = 0</m>.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					We can substitute these values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> into our general solution and solve for <m>C</m>.
					<md>
						<mrow> y =\amp\  Ce ^{x^2} + 3	\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 0	=\amp\  Ce^{0^2} + 3</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp				\amp						 0	=\amp\  C + 3</mrow>
						<mrow>\amp				\amp						-3	=\amp\  C</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Therefore, the particular solution that satisfies the differential equation and the initial condition is
					<me> y = -3e^{x^2} + 3. </me>
				</p>
				
			</solution>
	
			<p>
				In this example, we used the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m> to find the specific value of the constant <m>C</m> in the general solution. This allowed us to find a particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				In the exercises that follow, you will have the opportunity to practice finding particular solutions using initial conditions.
