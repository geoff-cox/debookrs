					Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation

				<p>
					As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.
					<aside>
						<p>
							The <m>y^2</m> term makes the DE nonlinear.
						</p>
					</aside>
					This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms cannot be separated by multiplication. 
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.

		<example>
  
			<p>
				Suppose some product rule produced the following derivative
		
				<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq">
					2e^{2x} \cdot \sin x + e^{2x}\cdot \cos x.
				</men>
	
				Write down the product rule that this came from. That is, rewrite it in the form 
				<me>[f \cdot g]^{\prime}.</me>
				
			</p>
	  
			<solution>
	  
				<p>
					Our goal is to find <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> so that the <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom"> product rule </xref> gives us <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/>. This requires that we match the terms of <m>f' \cdot g + f \cdot g'</m> and <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/>.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Observing that <m>[e^{2x}]^{\prime} = 2e^{2x}</m>, and <m>[\sin x]^{\prime} = \cos x,</m> then it makes sense to match the terms like so
					<me>\underset{f^{'}}{\underline{2e^{2x}}} \cdot \underset{g}{\underline{\sin x}} + \underset{f}{\underline{e^{2x}}} \cdot \underset{g^\prime}{\underline{\cos x}}.</me>
				  </p>
	
				<p>
					Therefore, we can rewrite <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/> like so 
					<me>2e^{2x} \cdot \sin x + e^{2x}\cdot \cos x = [e^{2x} \cdot \sin x]^{\prime},</me>
					and we have "reversed the product rule".
				</p>
	  
			</solution>
	  
		</example>

		<example>

			<p>
				Suppose the following expression is the derivative of a product of two functions, where <m>z</m> is a function of <m>t</m>:
				<me>6ze^{6t} + e^{6t} z'</me>
				Find the two functions and write down the derivative of their product, explicitly showing the steps involving the product rule.
			</p>
	
			<solution>
				<p>
					We are still trying to identify two functions, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We may need to rearrange a little bit, but we do in fact have such functions, as shown below.
					<me>
						\us{\large f'}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{6e^{6t}}}} 	\cdot \us{\large g}{\us{\uparrow}{z}}
							+ \us{\large f}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{6t}}}}	\cdot \us{\large g'}{\us{\uparrow}{z'}}
					</me>
					Hence, <m>f=e^{6t}</m> and <m>g=z</m> and the derivative, using the product rule, is
					<me>
						\frac{d}{dt}\Big( e^{6t}\cdot z \Big) = 6ze^{6t} + e^{6t} z'
					</me>
				</p>
	
				<p>
					Warning:  You've been looking at a very special class of expressions! Not every sum of terms comes from the product rule. For example, we cannot un-do the product rule in the expression
					<me>x^3\cdot y' + x^2\cdot y,</me>
					because the derivative of <m>x^3</m> is not <m>x^2</m>. You should pay close attention to whether you can or cannot un-do the product rule; this can help confirm if you have or have not made a mistake in solving a DE. We'll discuss this further later.
				</p>
	
			</solution>
	
		</example>

		<example>
  
			<p>
				Rewrite the expression
				<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-03-eq">
					e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + 3x^2 e^{h(x)}\cdot y
				</men>
				as a "reversed product rule" in the form 
				<me>\frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{h(x)}\right].</me>
			</p>
	
			<solution>
	
				<p>
					We will approach this as before and attempt to match the appropriate terms.
				</p>
	
				<p>
					The <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom"> product rule </xref> tells us that <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{h(x)}\right]</m> is the same as 
					<me>y' \cdot e^{h(x)} + y \cdot e^{h(x)} \cdot h'.</me>
					<aside>
						<p>
							We used the chain rule to compute <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{h(x)}\right].</m>
						</p>
					</aside>
					After arranging the terms, we match <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-03-eq"/> with
					<me>e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + \underline{h'(x)} e^{h(x)} \cdot y.</me>
					and see that <m>h'(x)</m> can only be matched to <m>3x^2</m>. So, 
					<me>h'(x) = 3x^2,</me>
					and this means that <m>h</m> is the anti-derivative of <m>3x^2</m>, or 
					<me>h(x) = x^3 + C.</me>
					This shows that there are many possible answers (one for each value of <m>C</m>), but only one is required. So we pick <m>C=0</m> which makes <m>h(x) = x^3</m> and conclude that
					<me>e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + 3x^2 e^{h(x)}\cdot y = \frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{x^3}\right].</me>
				</p>
	
			</solution>
	
		</example>

		<example>

			<p>
				Find a function, <m>\mu</m>, such that tbe product rule applied to <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot \mu\right]</m> gives
				<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-04-eq">
					\mu \cdot y' + 6 \mu \cdot y.
				</men>
			</p>
	  
			<solution>
	  
				<p>
					As we did before, we need to identify functions  such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We might label them as follows.
					<me>
						\begin{array}{ccccccc}
						z \!\!\!\! \amp \cdot \amp \!\!\!\! y' \!\!\!\! \amp + \amp \!\!\!\! 6z \!\!\!\! \amp \cdot \amp \!\!\!\! y \\
						\underset{\large f }{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large g'}{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large f'}{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large g }{\uparrow} \\
						\end{array}
					</me>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Based on the labeling in the question above, if we are going to be able to un-do the product rule, we need the function <m>z</m> to be such that its derivative is <m>6z</m>. We can translate that into a mathematical statement:
					<me>
						\text{"the derivative of } z \text{ is } 6z \text{"}\hspace{0.1cm} \Rightarrow \hspace{0.1cm}\frac{dz}{dx} = 6z.
					</me>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					In order to determine the unknown function <m>z</m>, we need to solve a differential equation! It turns out that this DE is first order and separable, so we can solve it using separation of variables.
					<md>
						<mrow> \frac{dz}{dx}			\amp = 6z				</mrow>
						<mrow> \frac{dz}{dx} \cdot dx	\amp = 6z \cdot dx		</mrow>
						<mrow> \frac 1z\ dz				\amp = 6 \cdot dx		</mrow>
						<mrow> \int\frac1z\ dz			\amp = \int 6\ dx		</mrow>
						<mrow> \ln|z|					\amp = 6x+C				</mrow>
						<mrow> |z|						\amp = e^{6x+C}			</mrow>
						<mrow> z						\amp = \pm e^C e^{6x}	</mrow>
						<mrow> z						\amp = A e^{6x}			</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					While we could choose any value for <m>A</m> that we like, we are looking for just one function <m>z</m>, so we will simplify things by choosing <m>A = 1</m>. Thus, the function we found is <m>z = e^{6x}</m>.
					Now let's confirm that it works. If we substitute our function in for <m>z</m> in <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-04-eq" />, then we can un-do the product rule as follows:
					<me>
						\begin{array}{cccccccccccc}
						e^{6x} \!\!\!\! \amp \cdot \amp \!\!\!\! y' \!\!\!\! \amp + \amp \!\!\!\! 6e^{6x} \!\!\!\! \amp \cdot \amp \!\!\!\! y \!\!\!\! \amp \ds = \frac{d}{dx}\Big( \amp \!\!\!\! e^{6x} \!\!\!\! \amp \cdot \amp \!\!\!\! y \!\!\!\!\! \amp \Big). \\
						\underset{\large f }{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large g'}{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large f'}{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large g }{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large f }{\uparrow} \!\!\!\! \amp \amp \!\!\!\! \underset{\large g }{\uparrow} \!\!\!\!\! \amp \\
						\end{array}
					</me>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Notice that if we identify <m>e^{6x}</m> as the function <m>f</m>, then we do indeed see its derivative, <m>6e^{6x}</m> in the other term. If we made a mistake in finding the function <m>z</m>, this would be the point where we could catch our mistake.
				</p>

					It may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.

					</me>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function <m>z</m> such that
					<me>\frac{dz}{dx} = z\sec^2 x.</me>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.

					</md>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Since we need only one function <m>z</m>, we can choose any value we like for <m>A</m>. Here we will choose <m>A = 1</m>, and therefore the function <m>z</m> is <m>z = e^{\tan x}</m>. We can check by un-doing the product rule.

				This is a generic version of the previous example. If we can draw a conclusion using this generic version, we might be able to use it in future examples.
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				As before, it may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.
				<me>
					\ub{z}_{\scriptsize f}\cdot \ub{y'}_{\scriptsize g'} + \ub{zP(x)}_{\scriptsize f'}\cdot \ub{y}_{\scriptsize g}
				</me>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function <m>z</m> such that
				<me>\frac{dz}{dx} = zP(x).</me>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.

					<mrow>		z	\amp = \pm e^{\int P(x) dx}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				Since we need only one function <m>z</m>, we usually choose the positive one and therefore we write <m>z = e^{\int P(x) dx}</m>.
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				This may not look like much, but let's see if it would work for the previous examples already did. Recall that we were trying to un-do the product rule in the expression
				<men> z\cdot y' + z\sec^2 x\cdot y	</men>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				In this example, we would identify the function <m>P(x)</m> as <m>P(x) = \sec^2 x</m>. Then the function <m>z</m> we desire would be given by
				<me>\ds z = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int \sec^2 x dx} = e^{\tan x + C} = e^{\tan x}.</me>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				(Notice that we chose <m>C = 0</m> because we need only one function <m>z</m>, and this is the simplest choice for <m>C</m>).
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				So our formula does give the same function <m>z</m> we found previously. Let's practice one more.
			</p>
	  
		  </solution>
	  
		</example>
	  
		<example>
	  
		  <p>
			Suppose <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. Find one function <m>z(x)</m> such that the derivative of <m>z(x)\cdot y</m> has the form
			<me>z\cdot y' + z\cdot\frac{1}{x}\cdot y</me>
		  </p>
	  
		  <solution>
	  
			<p>
			  In this example, the <m>\ds \frac{1}{x}</m> plays the same role as <m>P(x)</m> (in the previous EXAMPLE). Thus we can find <m>z</m> in a similar way.
			  <me>\ds z = e^{\int 1/x\ dx} = e^{\ln|x| + C}.</me>
			</p>
	  
			<p>
				As in the previous example, we need only one function <m>z</m>, so we can simplify this expression. In this case, we can choose <m>C = 0</m>, and we can also eliminate the absolute value. This lead us to <m>z = e^{\ln x}</m>, which further simplifies to <m>z = x</m>. As in the previous examples, we can replace <m>z</m> in the original expression and then actually un-do the product rule.

		<p>
			The integrating factor method uses a three-step strategy to solve first-order linear differential equations in the <em>standard form</em>:
			<fn>
				<p>
					Every linear differential equation looks like
					<me> 
						a_n(x)y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
					</me>.
					The first-order version of this is
					<me> 
						a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
					</me>,
					but we can divide both sides of this equation by <m>a_1(x)</m>:
					<me>
						y' + \us{P(x)}{\ub{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \us{Q(x)}{\ub{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}
					</me>.
					Since every first-order linear differential equation can always be written as
					<me> 
						y' + P(x)y = Q(x) 
					</me>,
					we call this the first-order linear <em>standard form</em>.
				</p>
			</fn>
			<men xml:id="if-standard-form0"> 
				y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
			</men>.
			The heart of this method is the first step: finding the correct integrating factor. The second step uses this factor to write the left side as a single derivative. Finally, the last step finds the solution by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>.
		</p>
	
		<paragraphs><title> Step 1: Finding the Integrating Factor </title>
		
			<p>
				Understanding how to find the integrating factor is crucial. Let's carefully walk through this important process.
			</p>
			<p>
				Consider the differential equations (specific on the left, general on the right):
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\us{\text{product rule?}}{\ub{y' + x^2 y}} = 5x^2 
						</me>,
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\us{\text{product rule?}}{\ub{y' + P(x)y}} = Q(x) 
						</me>.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				We would like to rewrite the left side as a single derivative using the <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom">backward product rule</xref>. However, the <m>y'</m> alone suggests there is a missing second function that the product rule needs. Maybe there is a function that we can multiply both sides of the equation by to get the desired product rule. Let's call it <m>\mu</m> for now and see if we can find it. We start by multiplying both sides by <m>\mu</m>:
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\mu y' + 3x^2 \mu y = 5x^2\mu 
						</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\mu y' + P(x)\mu y = Q(x)\mu 
						</me>.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
	
				Notice that the left side almost looks like the product rule <m>\left[ \mu y \right]' = \mu y' + \mu' y</m>, except for the boxed value where <m>\mu'</m> should be (see below).
	
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\overset{\ds \mu}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \mu}} 	\cdot 
							\overset{\ds y'}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y'}} 		+ 
							\overset{\ds \color{blue}{\mu'}}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \color{blue}{\boxed{3x^2 \mu}}}}	\cdot 
							\overset{\ds y}		{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y}} 		= 
							5x^2\mu 
						</me>,
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\overset{\ds \mu}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \mu}} 	\cdot 
							\overset{\ds y'}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y'}} 		+ 
							\overset{\ds \color{blue}{\mu'}}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \color{blue}{\boxed{P(x) \mu}}}}	\cdot 
							\overset{\ds y}		{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y}} 		= 
							Q(x)\mu 
						</me>.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
	
				This shows that the <m>\mu</m> that works is the one that satisfies
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\mu' = 3x^2 \mu
						</me>
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> 
							\mu' = P(x) \mu
						</me>.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
	
				Careful inspection shows that these are separable differential equations where the unknown <m>\mu</m> can be found using separation of variables!

				Although the solution conatains a constant, we only need one function that works, so we set <m>C = 1</m>. The function <m>\mu</m> is called the <em>integrating factor</em> and finding it is the first step toward solving a first order differential equation.

			In summary, the integrating factor method is a three-step process that utilizes the integrating factor to rewrite the left side of the equation, enabling direct integration and leading to the general solution.

			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ y \cdot e^{-2x} \right] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} \quad \leftarrow \text{Easy to solve!} </mrow>
			</md>
			and then we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to free the unknown <m>y</m> from inside the <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m>, so that we can solve for it. However, we have not talked about how the integrating factor gets the differential equation into this form. Luckily, the product rule for deriviatives holds the answer. Therefore, let's start this discussing by reminding ourselves that the product rule is given by
			<me> \frac{d}{dx}[\ f \cdot g\ ] = \frac{d}{dx}[\ f\ ] \cdot g + f \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\ g\ ]. </me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Ok, the claim is that after a some math the differential equation
			<men xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq1"> \frac{dy}{dx} - 2y = 5 </men>
			can be rewritten as 
			<men xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq2"> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ y \cdot e^{-2x} \right] = 5 e^{-2x}. </men>
			To explain this, it may be easier to work backwards. That is, let's start with <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq2" /> and see how it may connect back to <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" />. We start by applying the product rule on the left side,
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[\ y \cdot e^{-2x}\ ] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[\ y\ ] \cdot e^{-2x} + y \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\ e^{-2x}\ ] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{-2x} + y \cdot \left(-2 e^{-2x}\right) \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq3"> \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{-2x} - 2 y \cdot e^{-2x} \amp = 5 e^{-2x}. </mrow>
			</mdn>
			At this point stop and compare equation <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" /> with the last equation <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq3" />. Do you see how the two equations are connected?
		</p>
	
		<p>
			You should see that multiplying both sides of <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" /> by <m>e^{-2x}</m> gives you <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq3" />.
	
		</p>
	
		<p>
			In a nutshell, the integrating factor technique attempts to solve
			<me>y' + P(x)y = Q(x)</me>
			by multiplying both sides by an unknown function, <m>\mu</m>
			<me>\mu y' + \mu P(x)y = \mu Q(x)</me>
			then find a <m>\mu</m> so that the left-hand side can be written as the product rule of <m>\mu</m> and <m>y</m>.
			<me>\us{\large \text{product rule}}{\ub{\mu y' + \mu P(x)y}} = \mu Q(x)</me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			To clarify, let's look at an example where we know <m>\mu</m>.
		</p>
		  
		<p>
			The previous example shows how to solve the equation when you know what <m>\mu</m> is. However, in a real problem, you will have to find <m>\mu</m> first!
		</p>
		  
		<p>
			Let's build on the previous example to try and understand why <m>\mu = e^{6x}</m> worked. It is important to try and think of <m>\mu(x)</m> as the missing part needed to to be consistent with the product rule. That is, the left-side of the equation
		  
			<me>\us{\large \text{product rule}}{\us{\large \text{incomplete}}{\ub{y' + 6y}}} = 1</me>
		  
			is missing a second function needed to be consistent with the product rule. So let's fill-in this missing function by multiplying both sides by <m>\mu</m>,
		  
			<men xml:id="complete-product-rule-eqn">\mu y' + 6 \mu y = \mu.</men>
		  
			Is the left-side, <m>\mu y' + 6 \mu y</m>, equal to <m>\left[\mu y\right]'</m>? Well, not exactly, since taking this derivative shows the difference between these two, namely

			However, what if <m>\mu</m> was chosen so that <m>\mu' = 6\mu</m>? It turns out that this is exactly how we chose <m>\mu</m>. Finding <m>\mu</m> such that <m>\mu' = 6\mu</m> is itself a differential equation which can be solved using separation of variables. (You may try it yourself first for practice, then look below to see how to solve this DE.)
		</p>
		  
		<p>
			Using separation of variables, solve
			<md>
			  <mrow>\mu' =\amp\ 6\mu.</mrow>
			</md>
			to get the solution
			  <fn>
				<md>
				  <mrow>\frac{d\mu}{dx} =\amp\ 6\mu</mrow>
				  <mrow>\frac{1}{\mu}d\mu =\amp\ 6\ dx</mrow>
				  <mrow>\int\frac{1}{\mu}d\mu =\amp\ \int 6\ dx</mrow>
				  <mrow>\ln|\mu| =\amp\ 6x + C</mrow>
				  <mrow>|\mu| =\amp\ e^{6x + C}</mrow>
				  <mrow>\mu =\amp\ \pm e^C e^{6x}</mrow>
				  <mrow>\mu =\amp\ A e^{6x}</mrow>
				</md>
			  </fn>
			<me>\mu = A e^{6x}.</me>
		  
			Since, we only need one <m>\mu</m> to work, we choose <m>A=1</m> for convenience, hence
		  
			<me>\mu = e^{6x}.</me>
		  
			Now you see where the <m>\mu</m> came from in part 1 of <xref ref="if-intro-exercise"/>.  In fact, this example outlines how <m>\mu</m> is found for any first order linear differential equation of the form 
			<men xml:id="EQ-1st-order-de-pre">y' + P(x)y = Q(x).</men>
