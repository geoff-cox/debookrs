<title> Modeling Data Collection and Tasks </title>

		At a recent meeting, several plans were proposed to handle the deer population. In this project, you will use differential equations to model the deer population under each of the plans. 
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					The default reaction to the deer heard is to implement no population control methods. Under this model, the deer population will grow without constraint at least in the near future. Develop an initial value problem to model the deer population.  A data set with population estimates for the deer heard should be compared to your model. 
				</p>
			</li>

				<p>
					Currently, hunting is not allowed inside of the park. There has been interest from several local hunters to allow for a fixed number of tags to be sold. Each tag, would allow a hunter to harvest one adult deer. In this senario, the park office would like an estimate for the number of tags to sell to keep the population constant.

					Several animal rights activist groups have complained about the plan to harvest deer. Additionally, hunting has become less popular in the area in recent years. This raises conserns over the feasibility of approach 2. A potential solution is to use a birth control dart, to prevent the female deer from concieving for a year. This would change the growth rate for the deer population. The park rangers would like to know what percentage of deer should be darted to effectively control the population.

					A combination of harversting and darting could also be used to control the population of deer in the park.
