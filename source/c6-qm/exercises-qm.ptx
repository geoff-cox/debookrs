			<solution>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Task 1: <m>-2</m>. Since the equation is autonomous (<m>y' = y^2 - 1</m>), the slope depends only on <m>y</m>, not on <m>t</m>. At any point where <m>y=-1</m>, the slope is the same regardless of the <m>t</m>-coordinate.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 2: <m>y(t + c)</m>. Autonomous equations exhibit horizontal shift symmetry, meaning any time-shifted version of a solution is also a solution.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 3: <m>y(t + 5)</m>. For autonomous equations, shifting a solution in time produces another valid solution.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 4: <m>y = 1</m> and <m>y = 3</m>. Setting <m>y^2 - 4y + 3 = 0</m> gives <m>(y-1)(y-3) = 0</m>, yielding equilibria at <m>y = 1</m> and <m>y = 3</m>.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 5: Stable (sink). For <m>f(y) = y^2 - 4y + 3</m>, we have <m>f'(y) = 2y - 4</m>. At <m>y = 1</m>, <m>f'(1) = -2 &lt; 0</m>, indicating the equilibrium is stable (a sink).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 6: For <m>y' = y(3 - y^2)</m>, set <m>y(3 - y^2) = 0</m> to find equilibria: <m>y = 0</m> or <m>3 - y^2 = 0</m>, giving <m>y = 0, \sqrt{3}, -\sqrt{3}</m>. Testing regions: for <m>y &lt; -\sqrt{3}</m>, try <m>y=-2</m>: <m>f(-2) = -2(3-4) = 2 &gt; 0</m> (upward arrow); for <m>-\sqrt{3} &lt; y &lt; 0</m>, try <m>y=-1</m>: <m>f(-1) = -1(3-1) = -2 &lt; 0</m> (downward arrow); for <m>0 &lt; y &lt; \sqrt{3}</m>, try <m>y=1</m>: <m>f(1) = 1(3-1) = 2 &gt; 0</m> (upward arrow); for <m>y &gt; \sqrt{3}</m>, try <m>y=2</m>: <m>f(2) = 2(3-4) = -2 &lt; 0</m> (downward arrow). Classification: <m>y = -\sqrt{3}</m> is a source (arrows away on both sides), <m>y = 0</m> is a sink (arrows toward from both sides), <m>y = \sqrt{3}</m> is a source (arrows away on both sides).</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Task 7: 1) An autonomous differential equation has the form <m>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y)</m>, where the rate of change depends only on <m>y</m>, not on <m>t</m>. 2) Set <m>f(y) = 0</m> and solve algebraically for <m>y</m>. 3) The phase line is a vertical number line showing equilibrium points and arrows indicating whether solutions increase (upward) or decrease (downward) in each region; it helps visualize long-term solution behavior. 4) Examine the arrows on the phase line: if they point toward the equilibrium from both sides, it's stable (sink); if they point away on both sides, it's unstable (source); if they point in opposite directions, it's semi-stable (node).</p>
					</li>

				<p>1) <m>-2</m>. 2) <m>y(t+c)</m>. 3) <m>y(t+5)</m>. 4) <m>y=1, y=3</m>. 5) Stable (sink). 6) Equilibria: <m>y=0</m> (sink), <m>y=\pm\sqrt{3}</m> (sources). 7) See solution for review question answers.</p>
