    <title>Numerical Solutions for Linear Systems</title>

    <introduction>
        <p>
            We've explored what linear systems are, how to visualize their behavior, and even how to write them neatly in vector form.  
            Now it's time to start <em>solving</em> them.  
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll begin with the classic trick that worked for single equations ‚Äî guessing exponential solutions ‚Äî then finish by showing how to approximate solutions step by step with a numerical method.
        </p>
    </introduction>

        <title>Numerical Solutions for Linear Systems</title>

        <p>
            Not every system is easy to solve exactly.  
            Sometimes, you just want to <em>see</em> what the solution looks like ‚Äî or approximate it for a while.  
            That's where numerical methods shine.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of the simplest is <em>Euler's Method</em>, which you've seen for single equations.  
            We'll now apply it to systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Suppose we have:
        </p>

        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{dx}{dt} \amp = x + y</mrow>
            <mrow>\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = -x + y</mrow>
        </md>

        <p>
            With initial conditions <m>x(0) = 1</m>, <m>y(0) = 0</m>, and a step size of <m>h = 0.1</m>.
        </p>

        <example xml:id="ex-euler-system">
            <title>Euler's Method for a System</title>
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Use Euler's method to take two steps for the system above.
                </p>
            </statement>
            <solution>
                <p>
                    <term>Step 1:</term> At <m>t = 0</m>, we have <m>x_0 = 1</m>, <m>y_0 = 0</m>.  
                    The derivatives are <m>x' = 1 + 0 = 1</m>, <m>y' = -1 + 0 = -1</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Update:
                </p>

                <me>
                    x_1 = 1 + 0.1(1) = 1.1, \qquad y_1 = 0 + 0.1(-1) = -0.1.
                </me>

                <p>
                    <term>Step 2:</term> At <m>t = 0.1</m>, we have <m>x_1 = 1.1</m>, <m>y_1 = -0.1</m>.  
                    Now <m>x' = 1.1 + (-0.1) = 1.0</m>, <m>y' = -1.1 + (-0.1) = -1.2</m>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Update again:
                </p>

                <me>
                    x_2 = 1.1 + 0.1(1.0) = 1.2, \qquad y_2 = -0.1 + 0.1(-1.2) = -0.22.
                </me>

                <p>
                    We now have approximate values after two steps:
                </p>

                <me>
                    (x(0.2), y(0.2)) \approx (1.2, -0.22).
                </me>

                <p>
                    Each step shows how <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> <q>talk</q> to each other as time progresses.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>
            Euler's Method may be simple, but it makes the <em>flow of information</em> between variables visible:  
            each update for <m>x</m> affects <m>y</m> on the next step, and vice versa.
        </p>
