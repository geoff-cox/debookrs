		<exercise label="p3-c2-s4-rq9"><title> <em>Why do we modify the particular solution <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> when solving LNCC equations?</em> </title>
			<statement>
				Why do we modify the particular solution <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> when solving LNCC equations?
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					We modify <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> to ensure that the particular solution does not share any terms with the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m>. This adjustment makes <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> independent, ensuring that the general solution properly represents the nonhomogeneous term of the differential equation.

		<exercise label="p3-c2-s4-rq10"><title> <em>In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> play, and why is it important that they are independent?</em> </title>
			<statement>
				In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> play, and why is it important that they are independent?
			</statement>
			<answer>
				<p>
					<p>
					<m>y_h</m> represents the solution to the homogeneous equation (where the nonhomogeneous term is zero), while <m>y_p</m> represents a particular solution that accounts for the nonhomogeneous term. It is important that they are independent so that their combined terms accurately reflect the behavior of both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts of the original differential equation.
