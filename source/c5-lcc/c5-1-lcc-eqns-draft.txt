	<title> Constant Coefficients &amp; Forcing Functions </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In this section, we define what it means for a linear differential equation to have constant coefficients. We'll begin by reviewing what makes a differential equation linear and then describe how forcing functions and coefficient types change the structure of such equations.

		<title> Forcing Functions on Linear Differential Equations </title>

		<p>
			A differential equation is called <term>linear</term> if it only contains linear terms, meaning the dependent variable and its derivatives appear to the first power without multiplication or composed with one another.
		</p>

		<p>
			An equation is nonlinear <term>nonlinear</term> if it includes terms like <m>y^2</m>, <m>(y')^3</m>, <m>\sin(y)</m>, or <m>y \cdot y''</m>, where the dependent variable is raised to a power or multiplied by one of its derivatives.
		</p>

	    <p>
			A general <m>n</m>-th order linear differential equation looks like this:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-forcing-function">
			\us{ \large\text{of}\ y^{(n)} }{ \us{ \large\text{coefficient} }{ 
				\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_n(x)} }}\ y^{(n)}
			}}	+ \cdots +
			\us{ \large\text{of}\ y'' }{ \us{ \large\text{coefficient} }{
				\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_2(x)} }}\ y''
			}}	+
			\us{ \large\text{of}\ y' }{ \us{ \large\text{coefficient} }{
				\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_1(x)} }}\ y'
			}}	+
			\us{ \large\text{of}\ y }{ \us{ \large\text{coefficient} }{
				\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{a_0(x)} }}\ y
			}}	=
			\us{ \large\text{function} }{  \us{ \large\text{forcing} }{
				\us{\uparrow}{ {\color{BurntOrange} \ul{f(x)} }}
			}}
		</men>

		<p>
			The coefficients <m>a_n(x), \dots, a_0(x)</m> and the right-hand side <m>f(x)</m> depend only on the independent variable, which we‚Äôre calling <m>x</m>. While we previously referred to <m>f(x)</m> as a constant term, in this context, it is known as the <term>forcing function</term>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Forcing functions are not always easily identifiable on the right-hand side of a differential equation. Sometimes, <m>y</m> terms and their derivatives may be mixed in, or parts of the forcing function may appear on the left.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the equation
			<me>
				y'' + 2y + 5x = -5 + 3y'
			</me>
			the forcing function is not immediately clear. Rearranging it into standard form:
			<me>
				y'' - 3y' + 2y = 5x - 5
			</me>
			reveals that the forcing function is <m>5x - 5</m>.

		<title> Constant Coefficients </title>

		<p>
			A linear differential equation has <term>constant coefficients</term> if all the coefficients <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \dots, a_0</m> are constants rather than functions of the independent variable <m>x</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, a linear differential equation with constant coefficients looks like:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="lcc-eqn">
			a_{n}\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = f(x)
		</men>.

		<p>
			Here are a few examples of linear equations with constant coefficients:
		</p>

		<me>
			2y'' - 3y' + 5y = 0, \qquad y''' + 4y'' - 2y' + 7y = e^x
		</me>,

		<p>
			And here are some that do not have constant coefficients:
		</p>

		<me>
			\boxed{3^x}\ y'' + \boxed{2x}\ y' + y = 0, \qquad y'' + y' + \boxed{\ln x}\ y = \sin x
		</me>.

      	In the next section, we‚Äôll explore what happens when the forcing function is zero. This leads us into the important class of homogeneous equations.
