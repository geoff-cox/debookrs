		Welcome to the world of differential equations, where algebra and calculus blend together to form a powerful branch of mathematics that describes the dynamics of the world around us. Similar to equations you've seen in algebra, the goal of "differential equations" is to solve for an unknown. This time the equations contain one or more derivatives and the unknowns are functions, instead of numbers.

		Differential equations represent a powerful set of mathematical tools that describe how quantities change over time or space. They represent the language of change, growth, and dynamics in the world around us. From predicting the weather to understanding population dynamics, differential equations play a crucial role.
