      <p>
        Mathematicians often see solutions to given problems and ask <q>What if <m>\ldots</m>?</q> 
        What are the right kinds of <q>what if</q> questions to ask?
        It's impossible to know at first <mdash/> mathematicians often ask <q>wrong</q> questions.
        That is, they often ask questions and find that the answer isn't particularly interesting.
        But asking enough questions often leads to some good <q>right</q> questions.
        Don't be afraid of doing something wrong; mathematicians do it all the time!
      </p>
    </remark>
    
    <p>
      Recall that in the previous section, we worked through a few examples of solving linear equations
      using substitution <mdash/> that is, we solved for one variable in one equation and substituted the resulting 
      expression into another equation.  What is a good question to ask after seeing <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>?
      Here are two possibilities (though not the only two):
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Did we really have to call the red balls <q><m>r</m></q>? Could we call them <q><m>q</m></q>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            What if we had <m>60</m> balls at the start instead of <m>30</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's look at the first question.
      Would the solution to our problem change if we called the red balls <m>q</m>? No,
      we picked the letter <q>r</q> because it made us think of <q>red</q>, but we could have picked <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or any other letter instead.
      The process of solving would have been exactly the same if we used <q>q</q> for the number of red balls, and at the end we'd find that <m>q = 10</m>, 
      and we would know that this meant that we had <m>10</m> red balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now let's look at the second question. Suppose we had <m>60</m> balls, but the other 
      relationships stayed the same. How would the situation and solution change? Let's compare the 
      original equations to the new equations.
    </p>
    <tabular halign="center">
      <row>
        <cell right="minor" bottom="minor">Original</cell>
        <cell bottom="minor">New</cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>r+b+g=30</m></cell>
        <cell><m>r+b+g=60</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>r=2g</m></cell>
        <cell><m>r=2g</m></cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell right="minor"><m>b=r+g</m></cell>
        <cell><m>b=r+g</m></cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
    <p>
      The process of solving would stay exactly the same, substituting <m>2g</m> for <m>r</m> in the third equation
      to get that <m>b=2g+g=3g</m>, and then substituting for both <m>r</m> and <m>b</m> in the first equation to get
      that <m>2g+3g+g=60</m>.  The only difference is that total is <m>6g=60</m> instead of <m>30</m>, so the value of 
      <m>g</m> is twice as much, and thus also the values of <m>r</m> and <m>b</m> are twice what they had been. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Two conclusions from answering these two questions are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            it doesn't matter what we call our variables, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            while changing the constants in the equations changes the solution,
      they don't really change the <em>method</em>
      of how we solve these equations.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, it is a great discovery to realize that all that matters about a linear system are the <em>constants</em>
      and the <em>coefficients</em> of the equations. By systematically handling these,
      we can solve any set of linear equations in a way that saves on processing power, whether the processing is being done
      by a human or by a computer.

    <title>Method of Elimination (of Variables)</title>
  <p>
    Let's return to <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>. As we mentioned before, there isn't just one
    right way of finding the solution to this system of equations.
    Here is another way to do it.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, we rewrite the equations so that all variables are on the left of the equal sign and all constants are on the right.
    Also, for a bit more consistency,
    let's list the variables in alphabetical order in each equation.
    Therefore we can write the equations as
    <men xml:id="eq_before_matrix">
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ -b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0 \end{array}
    </men>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let's add the first and last equations together,
    and write the result as a new third equation.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp -\amp 2g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>.
    A nice feature of this is that the only equation with a <m>b</m> in it is the first equation.  One could say
    that we <em>eliminated</em> the <m>b</m> from the third equation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next let's multiply the second equation by <m>-\frac{1}{2}</m>.
    This gives
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp g\amp +\amp r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp  g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp 2g\amp +\amp 2r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's now do both of those steps in a row to eliminate the <m>g</m> from the first and third equations; multiply the second equation by <m>-1</m> and add that to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum, and multiply the second equation by <m>-2</m> and add that to the third equation, replacing the third equation. Our new system of equations now becomes
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp 3r\amp =\amp 30 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    We can now multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{3}</m> and find that <m>r=10</m>;
    let's make this our new third equation, giving
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp +\amp  \amp  \amp \frac{3}{2}r\amp =\amp 30\\ \amp  \amp g\amp -\amp \frac{1}{2}r\amp =\amp 0\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now let's eliminate the <m>r</m>'s in the first and second equation.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the first equation,
    let's multiply the third equation by
    <m>-\frac{3}{2}</m> and add the result to the first equation,
    replacing the first equation with that sum.
    To remove the <m>r</m> in the second equation,
    we can multiply the third equation by <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> and add that to the second equation,
    replacing the second equation with that sum.
    This gives us:
    <me>
      \begin{array}{ccccccc} b\amp  \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 15\\ \amp  \amp g\amp  \amp  \amp =\amp 5\\ \amp  \amp  \amp  \amp r\amp =\amp 10 \end{array}
    </me>.
    We have arrived at the same result as when we solved this problem in <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>, 
    even though our steps were different.

  <p>
    Why did we need to learn another method (elimination) when our old method (substitution) worked and got the same answer?
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone thinks of a different way to solve a system using substitution <mdash/> Mary might choose a different variable
    to solve for than John chose, and Alicia might start with a different equation, and Steven might substitute into a different equation.
    When there are more than 2 or 3 variables, substituting gets really laborious, and it's not always clear what steps should 
    come next in order to make progress in solving. Elimination can be made into an algorithm,
    a set of steps to follow in a particular order that will always result in an answer.<fn>Even if sometimes the answer
      is that there is no solution, or that there are infinitely many solutions.</fn>  This is both comforting and practical; 
      if you have to work a problem by hand, it's nice to know you'll be able to complete it as long as you remember the steps, 
      and if you don't have to work the problem by hand, an algorithm means it's possible to program a computer to do the steps for you.

    We noticed earlier that there is nothing special about the letters <m>b</m>, <m>g</m> and <m>r</m>;

    being eliminated.  
  </p>
  <p>
    Let's look again at our system of equations in <xref ref="eq_before_matrix"/> and write the coefficients
     and the constants in a rectangular array. If any variables are missing from any equations, we write that the coefficient is <m>0</m>.

    Notice how even the equal signs are gone; we don't need them, for we know that the last entry

          A=\begin{bmatrix} a_{11}\amp a_{12}\amp a_{13}\amp \cdots\amp a_{1n}\\ a_{21}\amp a_{22}\amp a_{23}\amp \cdots\amp a_{2n}\\ a_{31}\amp a_{32}\amp a_{33}\amp \cdots\amp a_{3n}\\ \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \vdots\amp \ddots\amp \vdots\\ a_{m1}\amp a_{m2}\amp a_{m3}\amp \cdots\amp a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}

  <p>
    Since matrices contain all the important information from a linear system, we are working our way up to
    solving systems using only augmented matrices.  Using matrices saves us from having to write out the variables over and over
    again, and matrices are also easy for a computer to understand and manipulate.  Matrices are important objects in their own right, 
    and in future sections, we will be able to compute with matrices even when we don't think of them as corresponding to a system of linear equations.

            <p>
              The <em>method of elimination</em> is a way of solving systems of linear equations that can be made
              systematic and algorithmic.  
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Matrices</em> are arrays of numbers.  Right now, we are most interested in <em>augmented matrices</em>,
              whose entries correspond to the coefficients and constants of a system of linear equations.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Elimination works better than substitution when there are more than 2 or 3 variables,
              and it is the foundation of future sections of material.
