	<title>Completing the Product Rule</title>	

	<p>
		In algebra, a clever rearrangement of terms can make an equation easier to solve. For instance, to solve
		<me>
			\os{\large\text{incomplete square}}{\qquad \ob{\ x^2 + 6x\ } = -1}
		</me>,
		we complete the square by adding <m>9</m> (since <m>(6/2)^2 = 9</m>) to both sides:
		<me>
			\ub{x^2 + 6x + 9}_{\large\text{complete square}} = -1 + 9
		</me>,
		which gives a single perfect square:
		<me>
			(x + 3)^2 = 8.
		</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		This grouping is helpful because a square root immediately reveals the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		Some <term>first-order differential equations</term> benefit from a similar idea. Instead of forming a single square, we aim to group the left-hand side as a <em>single derivative</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, take the equation:
		<me>
			\os{\large\text{incomplete product rule}}{\qquad \ob{\ \frac{dy}{dx} + 6 y\ } = -1}
		</me>.
	</p>

	<p>
		As you will soon learn, multiplying both sides by <m>e^{6x}</m> actually <q>completes the product rule</q> in a similar way that adding <m>9</m> completed the square:
		<me>
			\ub{e^{6x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 6e^{6x} y}_{\large\text{complete product rule}} = -e^{6x}
		</me>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Applying the product rule in reverse gives a single derivative on the left:
		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{6x} y \right] = -e^{6x}
		</me>.
	</p>

	<p>This new form makes solving easier since direct integration can be used.</p>

	<p>
		This process of multiplying by the right function to complete the product rule is the heart of the <term>integrating factor method</term>, and it raises an important question:
	</p>

	<p><em>How do we know what function to multiply by?</em> That's what we'll figure out in the next section.</p>
