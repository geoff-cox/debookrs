			include something in chapter one to explain why we can't just integrate all first-order DEs...

		In the previous chapter, we studied a solution technique for DEs that are linear and have constant coefficients. We were able to solve certain nonhomogeneous DEs of this type, so long as the nonhomogeneous function belongs to a certain subset of functions. We would not be able to use that technique to solve DEs where the nonhomogeneous function is discontinuous. This is the main reason we study a new solution technique, called 'the Laplace Transform.'

		The Laplace transform solution technique is less direct than other solution techniques. We typically start with a DE in terms of an independent variable <m>t</m>. Let's assume the dependent variable is <m>y</m> for now, so our goal is to solve for an unknown function <m>y</m> in terms of the independent variable <m>t</m>. We take the Laplace transform of the DE, and the result is an algebraic equation in terms of the variable <m>s</m> and a function <m>Y(s)</m>. We then solve for <m>Y(s)</m> using algebra. Finally, we get our desired solution by taking the inverse Laplace transform, as shown in figure (Figure number).

		Before we solve any DEs with this new solution technique, we need to practice the pieces of the solution technique. Thus, we dedicate the next couple of sections on learning what the Laplace transform is, how to find the Laplace transform of a function, and how to take the inverse Laplace transform of a function. Then we will finally be solve DEs using this new solution technique.

		Edit Notes:
		<ul>
			<li>Greg: I think in the intro we should make it more clear that at its heart, the Laplace Transform allows us to solve a DE using algrebra instead of calculus. (Yes, calc is involved, but with tables, only inherently, not explicitly.) And instead of using calculus with the variable <m>t</m>, we use algebra and the variable <m>s</m>.</li>
