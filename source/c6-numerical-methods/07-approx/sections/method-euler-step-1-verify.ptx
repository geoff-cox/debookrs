			Euler's method operates on a very intuitive principle: starting from an initial point, the method uses the differential equation itself to take small steps along the direction of the slope given by the equation. At each step, the method calculates the slope of the unknown function at the current point, then moves a small distance in the direction of this slope to find the next point. By repeating this process, Euler's method generates a sequence of points that approximates the true solution curve of the differential equation.
