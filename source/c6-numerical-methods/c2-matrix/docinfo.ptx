  <!-- It is possible to rename elements: -->
  <!-- <rename element="assemblage" xml:lang="en-US">Summary</rename> -->
  <rename element="inlineexercise">Activity</rename>
  <rename element="activity">Exercise</rename>
  <!-- I know the above renaming seems idiotic, but it accomplishes what I want with two sets of what are really 
   post-section exercises, one with answers showing (the divisional one, with non-interactive problems) and one 
   with no answers (containing interactive problems), so the two sets of problems have to be a different division 
   type and/or exercise type.  I know webwork works within activity on Runestone, so that's what I've chosen. As
   a bonus, activity has its own numbering. Also, I use a lot of runestone interactives inline that I would like to be called Activity, but as of this 
   writing, pretext has assumed that all runestone directives are exercise elements, especially fillin. -->
