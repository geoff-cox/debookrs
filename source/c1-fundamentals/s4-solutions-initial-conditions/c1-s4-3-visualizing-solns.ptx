	<p>
        A powerful way to deepen your understanding of solutions to differential equations is through visualization. Graphical representations can reveal the behavior of solutions and their dependence on parameters, offering insights that are difficult to grasp from equations alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the differential equation:
        <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, </me>
        which has the general solution:
        <m> y = c e^{x^2} + 3, </m>

                In the figure, each green curve represents a particular solution.
            </p>

			<p>
				The general solution 
				<me>
					y = ce^{x^2} + 3
				</me>
				generates each of the particular solution curves, one for each value of the constant <m>c</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				<em> Hover over the green curves in the figure to see each solution. </em>
			</p>

			<p>
				While the figure shows only a few members of the family of solutions, there exists a solution curve for every possible value of <m>c</m>.

	<p>
		While visualizing the family of solutions helps us understand how they behave with different constants, it also raises a key question: how do we choose a specific solution? Initial conditions are crucial here. By specifying the value of the solution or its derivatives at a certain point, we can identify the constant <m>c</m> and find a unique solution. In the next section, we will examine how initial conditions help us move from a general to a specific solution that addresses the problem's requirements.
