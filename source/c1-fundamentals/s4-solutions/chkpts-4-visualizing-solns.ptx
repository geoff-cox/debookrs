	<task><title> <em>Select the particular solution in <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" /> that passes through the point <m>(0,5)</m></em> </title>
		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>\ds y = -2e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The value of <m>c</m> must make the solution pass through <m>(0, 5)</m>. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>\ds y = 0.5e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Remember that at <m>x = 0</m>, the exponential term <m>e^{x^2}</m> equals 1, so <m>y(0) = c + 3</m>. What value of <m>c</m> gives <m>y(0) = 5</m>? Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><m>\ds y = 2e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
				<feedback>Correct! The value <m>c = 2</m> ensures that <m>y(0) = 2 + 3 = 5</m>, so this solution passes through <m>(0, 5)</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>\ds y = 5e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The general solution would pass through <m>(0, 4)</m> if <m>c = 1</m>. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>

	<task><title> <em>Select the <m>c</m>-value for the solution in <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" /> that passes through the point <m>(1,1)</m></em> </title>
		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>c = -2</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> and look at the coefficient on <m>e^{x^2}</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>c = 0.5</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> and look at the coefficient on <m>e^{x^2}</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement><m>c = 2</m></statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> and look at the coefficient on <m>e^{x^2}</m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><m>c = -1</m></statement>
				<feedback>Correct! Hovering over the curve passing through <m>(1,1)</m> shows the particular solution <m>\ds y = -e^{x^2}+3</m>, so <m>c=1</m>.</feedback>

				<statement>True</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The value of <m>c</m> is what makes each particular solution different.</feedback>

				<feedback>Correct! Each value of <m>c</m> corresponds to a different particular solution.</feedback>

	<task><title> <em>Which of the following is the best visual description of a family of solutions?</em> </title>
		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>Collection of all the possible solution curves.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! A family of solutions includes all possible solutions so visually it would be the collection of all solution curves.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>A single solution curve.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. A family of solutions includes all possible particular solutions, not just one.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>The intersection of all the possible solution curves.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. A family of solutions includes all possible solutions, not just their intersections.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>The curve of the general solution.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The general solution is a framework for all possible solutions, but it is not the family of solutions itself. Also, since a general solution includes constants, doesn't have <q>a curve</q>.</feedback>

	<task><title> <em>Which of the following is the best visual description of a particular solution?</em> </title>
		<statement/>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>A curve that represents the solution with a specific constant value.</statement>
				<feedback>
					Correct! A particular solution is a single curve that satisfies the differential equation with a specific constant value, distinguishing it from the general solution.
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>A family of curves that represents all possible solutions to the differential equation.</statement>
				<feedback>
					Incorrect. This description fits a general solution, which encompasses all particular solutions by varying the parameter.
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>A straight line that intersects all solutions to the differential equation.</statement>
				<feedback>
					Incorrect. A particular solution is not necessarily a straight line, and it does not intersect all other solutions. It's a unique curve based on specific conditions.
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>A set of discrete points that satisfy the differential equation for various parameter values.</statement>
				<feedback>
					Incorrect. A particular solution is typically represented by a continuous curve, not a set of discrete points.

				<statement>Only one solution curve can pass through that specific point.</statement>
				<feedback>Correct! A unique solution curve corresponds to each point on the plot.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>Several curves may pass through the same point.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Each curve is unique to a specific point.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>All curves pass through the same point.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. The curves do not overlap.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>No curves pass through the selected point.</statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Each point corresponds to one curve in the family of solutions.</feedback>
