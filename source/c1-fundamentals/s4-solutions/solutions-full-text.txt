			The primary goal of any introductory differential equations course is to explore a variety of techniques for solving differential equations. In fact, the majority of questions you will see in this course begin with "Solve the following Differential Equation." You may be so conditioned to this statement that you will find the solution, circle the answer and move on. This leads many students to struggle with the following natural follow-up question:
			<blockquote>
				<em> <q>What does it mean to be a solution to a Differential Equation?</q> </em>
			</blockquote>
			This section will guide you through different aspects of solutions, including general solutions, particular solutions, and the role of initial conditions in specifying a unique solution. By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of how solutions behave and how they are characterized, which will set the stage for more advanced methods of finding these solutions in later chapters.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Solutions to Differential Equations </title>

		<p>
			A solution to any equation is a value or function that <q>satisfies</q> the equation. The term <em>satisfies</em> simply means that when if you plug the value or function into the equation, it can be simplified to an identity (something undeniably true), such as <m>0=0</m> or <m>1=1</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, to verify that <m>y=2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> are solutions to the equation 
			<me>
				y^3 = 3y + 2,
			</me>
			we plug <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> in for <m>y</m> and simplify until we see an identity (or not), like so
		</p>

					\ul{y = 2}:

					<mrow> (2)^3 	=\amp\ 3(2) + 2             </mrow>

		<p>
			Since <m>y=2</m> yields an identity, it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, <m>y=0</m> does not give an identity, so it is not a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that <em>solutions are functions instead of numbers</em>. Additionally, since differential equations contain derivatives, some calculus will be required to verify solutions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's see this by verifying if <m>y = 3x</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> are solutions to the differential equation
			<m>\ds y^\prime = 3y.</m>
		</p>

					<mrow>	3e^{3x}								=	\amp\ 3e^{3x}	\quad✅ </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			This shows that <m>y=e^{3x}</m> is a solution to <m>\ds y^\prime = 3y</m>, but <m>y=3x</m> is not.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's practice verifying solutions with a few more examples.
		</p>

		<example>

			<statement>
				<p>
					Verify if <m>\ y= 2x^2\ </m> is a solution to 
					<me>xy' - 2x^2 = y</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			
			<solution>
				<p>
					Although it is not required, let's move all terms to the left-side of the equation, like so
					<me>xy' - 2x^2 - y = 0</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Doing this allows us to focus on simplifying just one side of the equation after plugging in <m>\ y= 2x^2</m>. 
					<md>
						<mrow> 									xy' - 2x^2 - y		=\amp 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> x\left( 2x^2 \right)' - 2x^2 - \left( 2x^2 \right)	=\amp 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> 					x\left( 4x \right) - 2x^2 - 2x^2	=\amp 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> 									4x^2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2	=\amp 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> 													0	=\amp 0	\quad✅ </mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>y= 2x^2</m> is a solution to <m>xy' - 2x^2 = y.</m>
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<example>

			<statement>
				<p>
					Verify if <m>\ P = \sin t\ </m> is a solution to 
					<me>2P'' + P = \sin t</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Since <m>P''</m> appears in the equation, lets compute it first.
					<me>	
						P = \sin t, \quad P' = \cos t, \quad P'' = -\sin t
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					Moving all the terms to the left and plugging in <m>P</m> and <m>P''</m>, we get
					<md>
						<mrow> 							2P'' + P - \sin t	=	\amp\ 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> 2\left( -\sin t \right) + (\sin t) - \sin t	=	\amp\ 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> -2\sin t + \cancel{\sin t} - \cancel{\sin t}	=	\amp\ 0			</mrow>
						<mrow> 									-2\sin t	\ne	\amp\ 0	\quad❌</mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>P = \sin t</m> is <term> not a solution </term> to <m>2P'' + P = \sin t.</m>
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>
		
		<p>
			You can even verify that a function is a solution to a differential equation when the function contains constants as the next two examples show.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="one-de-many-solns">

			<statement>
				<p>
					Show that the functions 
					<me>y = e^{2x},\ \ y = 2e^{2x},\ \ y = 3e^{2x},\ \ y = -7e^{2x},\ \ y = 0.3e^{2x},\ \ y = \pi e^{2x} </me> 
					are solutions to the differential equation
					<me>\quad y' - 2y = 0</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Verifying each function individually would be repetitive because they all follow the same pattern: 
					<me>y = (\text{some number})\ e^{2x} \quad \text{or} \quad y = c e^{2x} </me>, 
					where <m>c</m> can be any constant. Let's show that <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Substitute <m>\ y = c e^{2x}\ </m> into the differential equation:
					<md>
						<mrow> 									y' - 2y	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	\left(c e^{2x}\right)' - 2(c e^{2x})	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 				c e^{2x} (2) - 2c e^{2x}	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 					2c e^{2x} - 2c e^{2x}	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 										0	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution for any value of constant, <m>c</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<example xml:id="two-constant-solution-verification">

			<statement>
				<p>
					Verify that <m>\ y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + x^2 + 2\ </m> is a solution to
					<me>y'' - y = -x^2</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>

			<solution>

				<p>
					Move terms to left: <m>\quad y'' - y + x^2 = 0</m>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Plug in <m>\ y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + x^2 + 2\ </m> and simplify:
					<md>
						<mrow> 	\left( c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + x^2 + 2 \right)'' - (c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + x^2 + 2) + x^2 =\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	\left( -c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + 2x \right)' - c_1 e^{-x} - c_2e^{x} - x^2 - 2 + x^2 =\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + 2 - c_1 e^{-x} - c_2e^{x} - x^2 - 2 + x^2 =\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 		0	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>y = c_1 e^{-x} + c_2e^{x} + x^2 + 2</m> is a solution to
					<me>y'' - y = -x^2</me>.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Types of Solutions </title>

		<p>
			At this point, you know that <em> a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies it </em>. You also know, from <xref ref="one-de-many-solns"/>, that a differential equation can have more than one solution. In fact, the same example shows that a differential equation can have infinitely many solutions since <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution for infinitely many choices of the constant <m>c</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			It turns out that, without more information, every differential equation will have at least one constant in it's solution giving rise to a general form for all possible solutions. This general form is the <em><term>general solution</term></em> of the differential equation. <term>Particular Solutions</term> are the individual solutions corresponding to specific values of the constants in the general solution. The collection of every particular solution forms what is known as the <term>family of solutions</term> for the differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<xref ref="one-de-many-solns"/> provides a good illustration of the distinction between these solutions, since the differential <m>\ y' - 2y = 0\ </m> equation has
			<dl>
				<li><title>General Solution:</title>
					<p>
						<m>\ds y = c e^{2x}</m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><title>Particular Solutions:</title>
					<p>
						<m>\ds y = 5e^{2x}, \quad y = 3.1e^{2x}, \quad y = -2e^{2x}, \quad \text{etc.} </m>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li><title>Family of Solutions</title>
					<p>
						<m>\ds \left\{ \text{ all possible particular solutions for each } c \ \right\} </m>
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</p>

		<p>
			As an analogy, imagine the family of solutions as all the possible dates in October of 2025, then the general solution would be <c>10/dd/2025</c>, while the particular solutions would be <c>10/01/2025</c>, <c>10/02/2025</c>, <c>10/03/2025</c>, etc.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Visualizing Solutions </title>

		<p>
			A powerful way to understand solutions to differential equations is by visualizing them. Consider the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
			which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> (<xref ref="p1-c2-s4-details-1" text="custom">solution verification details</xref>).

					Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ.
