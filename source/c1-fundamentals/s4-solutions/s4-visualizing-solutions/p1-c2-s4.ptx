<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Visualizing Solutions </title>

	<p>
		A powerful way to understand solutions to differential equations is by visualizing them. Consider the differential equation
		<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
		which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> (<xref ref="p1-c2-s4-details-1" text="custom">solution verification details</xref>).
	</p>  

	<p>
		Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ (see <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" />).

				<li> 
					The general solution, <m>y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m>, provides the framework for all these individual solutions.

	<p>
		Although the figure only shows a few members of the infinite family of solutions, notice that the green curves never overlap. This means that each curve represents a unique solution. If you were to randomly select a point on the plot, you would, in effect, be selecting a single curveâ€”only one solution can pass through that specific point. This idea is at the heart of where particular solution come from and it will be the focus of the next section.
