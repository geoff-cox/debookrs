		<p>
			In this section, we'll explore a key concept in differential equations known as <term>order</term>. Think of the order of a differential equation as the number of layers or steps you need to peel away to reveal the original function. The more layers there are, the higher the order, and usually, the more complex the equation.
		</p>
		
		<definition xml:id="def-order">
			<statement>The <term>order</term> of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative that appears in the equation. For example, if the highest derivative is the first derivative, it's called a <em>first-order</em> differential equation. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, it's called a <em>second-order</em> differential equation, and so on.</statement>
		</definition>
		
		<example><title> <em>Identify the Order</em> </title>

			<solution><title> <m>\ds \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</m> </title>
				<p>
					<term>Order = 1.</term> This is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\ds\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>

			<solution><title> <m>\ds x^2 y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8</m> </title>
				<p>
					<term>Order = 3</term>. This is a <em>third-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>y'''</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>

			<solution><title> <m>\ds \frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17</m> </title>
				<p>
					<term>Order = 2</term> This is a <em>second-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\ds\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2}</m>.
				</p>
			</solution>
			
		</example>

		<note><title>Caution, Don't Confuse Exponents with Derivatives</title>
			<p>
				It's important to distinguish between exponents and derivatives. For example, in the second example, <m>y^8</m> indicates that the dependent variable is raised to the 8th power, but this is not related to the order of the differential equation.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Linear Terms </title>

		<p>
			The most informative label you can place on a differential equation is whether it is linear or nonlinear. While linearity often refers to equations that graph as straight lines, the concept of linearity in differential equations is more nuanced. Understanding this distinction is crucial as it significantly influences how the equations are solved and interpreted.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Before jumping in, it may be helpful to revisit meaning of <xref ref="def-dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent</xref> variables, <xref ref="def-terms" text="custom">terms</xref> and <xref ref="def-coefficients" text="custom">coefficients</xref> as we will be referencing them throughout this discussion.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Now, let's define what it means for a term in a differential equation to be linear.
		</p>
		
		<definition><title> Linear Term </title>
			<statement>
				<dl width="normal">
					<li xml:id="def-linear-term"><title>Linear Term</title>
						<p>
							A term that has one of the forms
						</p>
						<p>
							<me>a(t)\ y,\ a(t)\ y',\ a(t)\ y'',\ a(t)\ y''',\ \ldots</me>
						</p>
						<p>
							where <m>y</m> is the dependent variable. The coefficient, <m>a(t)</m>, can be a function of the independent variable, <m>t</m>, but not the dependent variable.
						</p>
					</li>
				</dl>
			</statement>
		</definition>
	
		<note><title> The linearity of a term depends entirely on the dependent variable </title>
			<p>
				The linearity of a term is determined by the presence of a single <m>y</m> or derivative of <m>y</m> to the power of <m>1</m>. The coefficients, <m>a(t)</m> play no part in the linearity.
			</p>
		</note>
	
		<example><title> Identify the Linear and Nonlinear Terms </title>
	
			<solution><title> <m>\ds e^{t}y^{(7)} + (t+1)y'y''' - t \ln y'' - y' \sin t - \tan y + \frac{4}{y} = \frac{3}{t}</m> </title>
				<p>
					To determine the linearity of a term we only need to consider the dependent variables (column <m>3</m> below). We are looking for a single <m>y</m> or derivative of <m>y</m> raised to the power of <m>1</m>. If we find such a term, we label it as linear. Otherwise, it is nonlinear. Let's separate the different parts in the following table.

				</tabular>
				
				<p>
					Note, since constant terms do not contain a dependent variable, they are necessarily linear. So, in the context of differential equations, <m>\ds\frac{3}{t}</m> is also a linear term.

			</solution>
	
		</example>
		
		<p>
			To help identify nonlinear terms, here are some common characteristics:
		</p>
	
		<assemblage xml:id="identifying-nonlinear-terms"><title> Identifying Nonlinear Terms </title>
			<p>
				A term is nonlinear if it contains a dependent variable, <m>y</m> or <m>y^{(n)}</m>, that is
			</p>
			<p>
				<ul marker="square">
					<li>
						<p>
							Raised to a power other than 1, e.g., <m>y^2</m> or <m>(y')^{-4}</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Inside another function, e.g., <m>\ln(y)</m> or <m>\sin(y)</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Multiplied or divided by another <m>y</m> or <m>y^{(n)}</m>, e.g., <m>y y'''</m> or <m>\ds\frac{y'}{y}</m>.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</assemblage>
	
		<p>
			Let's practice this with one more example.

		<p>
			In the world of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is vital. This distinction will often guide you on how to approach solving the equation and what methods to use. The good news is, all the work we did in the previous section will make this task much easier.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-linear">
			<statement>
				A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be expressed as
				<men xml:id="linear-equation">
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
				</men>
				If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			This definition might seem abstract at first, but it encompasses all possible linear differential equations. In practice, most equations you'll encounter will involve only a few terms, and the challenge lies in identifying whether any of those terms break the rule of linearity. If they do, the equation is nonlinear.
		</p>

		<example><title> Determine if the equation is linear or nonlinear </title>

			<solution><title> <m>\ds y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t</m> </title>
				<p>
					To classify this equation, we need to verify if every term involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives is linear. Let's break it down term by term:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\ 17t </mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y''}}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{\frac{1}{t^2} y'}}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y}}} = 
						\underset{\text{constant term}}{\underline{\color{blue}{17t}}}
					</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>
					Since each term involving <m>y</m> or its derivatives is linear, this differential equation is indeed linear.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>
		
		<p>
			In summary, recognizing whether a differential equation is linear or nonlinear will help you determine the appropriate methods for solving it. Linear equations allow for a more straightforward approach, while nonlinear equations often require specialized techniques.
