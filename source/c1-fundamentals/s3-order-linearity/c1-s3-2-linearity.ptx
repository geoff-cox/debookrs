	<introduction>

		<p>
			In the realm of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is essential. This classification determines the strategies in the solution process and gives insight into the complexity of the equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Identifying the linearity of a differential equation may seem challenging at first, but the task becomes straightforward with this guiding principle:
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			Therefore, we will start by discussing what it means for a term to be linear and then extend this concept to the entire differential equation. 
		</p>

	</introduction>
	
	<subsubsection><title> Linear Terms </title>

		<p>
			The linearity of a differential equation is determined solely by the dependent variable and its derivatives. A term in a differential equation is considered linear if it adheres to the following rule:
		</p>

		<p>
			<dl width="wide">
				<li xml:id="linear-term-rule"><title>Linear Term</title>
					<p>
						A <xref ref="summary-terms" text="custom">term</xref> of a differential equation is linear if it contains a single <xref ref="summary-dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent variable</xref> or a derivative of this variable to the power of <m>1</m> and not inside another function.
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</p>

		<p>
			It is important to note that the <xref ref="summary-coefficients" text="custom">coefficient</xref> of a term does not affect its linearity.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the differential equation:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5} + 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right) + y^2 = t^3.
			</me>
			The equation includes the following terms:
			<me>
				y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}, \quad 2t^3\ \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right), \quad y^2, \quad t^3.
			</me>
			Let's classify each term:
		</p>

		<dl>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds y\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves the product of <m>y</m> and <m>\frac{d^5y}{dt^5}</m>, violating the single-variable in a term condition.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds 2t^3\frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m></title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it involves a single derivative of <m>y</m> to the power of 1. Coefficients like <m>2t^3</m> do not impact linearity.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds \ln\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as the dependent variable is inside the logarithm function.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds y^2</m></title>
				<p>
					Nonlinear, as it involves <m>y</m> raised to the power of 2.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<title><m>\ds t^3</m></title>
				<p>
					Linear, as it does not involve the dependent variable or its derivatives.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>

		<p>
			Now, let's apply this understanding to a practical example.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Identify the linear and nonlinear terms in the following differential equations.
				</p>

				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<p>
							<m>
								\ds\frac{1}{t}y'' + y^2 + \ln(y') = e^t

	<subsubsection><title> Linear Differential Equations </title>

		<p>
			Extending the concept of linear terms, we say <q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q> This idea leads us to the following definition of a linear differential equation (of any order).
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="def-linear">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it can be written as the sum of linear terms, like so
					<fn>
						<p>
							This is commonly referred to a <term> linear combination </term> of the dependent variable and its derivatives.
						</p>
					</fn>
					<men xml:id="linear-equation">
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)\ y^{(n)}}} + \cdots +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)\ y''}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)\ y'}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)\ y}} = f(t)
					</men>
					If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			We are now equipped to determine the linearity of a differential equation by examining the linearity of each term, as demonstrated in the next example.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Determine the linearity of each differential equation.
					<me>
						y^{(5)} + \frac{y'}{x^2} + 5y = \ln x, \qquad P^{(6)} + \frac{m P'}{P} = (m - 1)^2
					</me>
					
				</p>
			</statement>
				
			<solution>
				<p>
					To determine the linearity, we need to examine the linearity of each term, remembering to focus only on the dependent variable and its derivatives.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the first equation, the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and we can label the linearity of each terms as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow> 
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}{\color{BurntOrange} y^{(5)} }} + 
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\frac{1}{x^2}{\color{BurntOrange} y'}} + 
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}5{\color{BurntOrange} y}} =\ \amp 
							\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln x}.
						</mrow>
					</md>
					Since every term is linear, the differential equation is linear.
				</p>

				<p>
					For the second equation, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the terms are labeled as
					<md>
						<mrow> 
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}\color{BurntOrange} P^{(6)}}} + 
							\underset{\overline{\text{nonlinear}}}{m\frac{{\color{BurntOrange} P'}}{{\color{BurntOrange} P}}} =\ \amp 
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}(m - 1)^2}}
						</mrow>,
					</md>
					showing the differential equation is nonlinear since there is at least one nonlinear term.
				</p>
