<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>

	<p>
		Solving a differential equation amounts to finding an unknown function. Since every function depends on some variable, then a differential equation must represent both the function and this variable. For example, if the solution of a differential equation happened to be <m>y = \cos(2x)</m>, then that equation would be associated to both the <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> variables.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now, consider the differential equation
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
		</men>
		Both <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are in the equation, but which one represents the unknown function? If you recall from calculus, the term <m>dy/dx</m> says take the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>. This means that <m>y</m> must be the function which depends on <m>x</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In differential equations, we call the unknown variable, <m>y</m>, the <em>dependent variable</em> and <m>x</m> is known as the <em>independent variable</em>. 
	</p>

	<example xml:id="c1-s1-1-ex1"><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				For each equation, identify the unknown function and the dependent/independent variables.
				<me>
					\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\quad 
					u'' + t^2 u = 0,\quad 
					Q'' = 11Q
				</me>
				
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation contains both <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies
				<ul>
					<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
					<li><m>P</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
					<li><m>s</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> indicates the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So,
				<ul>
					<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> that must depend on the other variable <m>t</m>.</li>
					<li><m>u</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
					<li><m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> implies that <m>Q</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, if no independent variable is shown, the context of the problem may provide it. Otherwise, we can choose one ourselvesâ€”say <m>t</m>.
