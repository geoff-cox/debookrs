		The most informative label you can place on a differential equation is whether it is linear or not. When you first learn about linearity in mathematics, it often involves functions whose graphs are straight lines. However, when we talk about the linearity of a differential equation, the concept is different and can be tricky to grasp for a beginner.

		To prepare for the definition of linearity of a DE, we need the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Recall the difference between a <xref ref="dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent</xref> and <xref ref="independent-variable" text="custom">independent</xref> variable.
					<fn>
						For example, <m>y</m> is the dependent and <m>t</m> is the independent variable in the equation 
						<me>t y'' + \sin(t)y = 0</me>.
					</fn>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<q>Terms</q> are parts in the equation that are separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A term is <term>linear</term> if it looks like
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<me> 
			\left(\text{function of } t\right), \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y }, \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y' }, \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y'' }, \ \ ...
		</me>
		where <m>{\color{blue} y }</m> is the dependent variable and <m>t</m> is the independent variable.
	Here are a few examples of linear terms:
		<me>
			3, \quad 3t, \quad 2t^2{\color{blue} y }, \quad \sin(t){\color{blue} y' }, \quad \left(t^2 - \frac{1}{t}\right){\color{blue} y''' }, \quad e^{t}{\color{blue} y^{(7)} } 
		</me>.
		Note, the (function of <m>t</m>) in each term does not need to be linear, however there can be at most one dependent variable, <m>\big( {\color{blue} y}, {\color{blue} y'}, {\color{blue} y'''}, {\color{blue} y^{(7)}} \big)</m> in each term.
