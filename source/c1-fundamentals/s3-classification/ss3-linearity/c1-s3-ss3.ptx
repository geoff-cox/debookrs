	<p>
		Recognizing the distinction between linear and nonlinear differential equations is crucial. The linearity of terms naturally leads to the general concept of linearity, and the previous section has equipped us well for this important task.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be written as
			<men xml:id="linear-equation">
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
			</men>
			If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As the examples will show, most equations you encounter will only have a few terms and our approach will be to find just one of them that is not linear. If we can't, then the equation is linear. 
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Determine if the following differential equation is linear.
		</p>
		<me> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t </me>.

		<solution>
			<p>
				To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear. Let's rewrite this equation like <xref ref="linear-equation" /> and check each term one-by-one.
				<md>
					<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\amp 17t </mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y'' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\left(\frac{1}{t^2}\right){\color{blue} y' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y }}} =\amp 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{17t}}
					</mrow>.
				</md>
				Since every term is linear, this differential equation is linear.
			</p>
		</solution>
