							<p>
								The highest order derivative present in a DE.
							</p>
						</li>

								A DE that contains at least one nonlinear term.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="summary-satisfies"><title> Satisfying a DE </title>
							<p>
								A function satisfies a DE if substituting it into the dependent variable results in the equation simplifying to a true statement (e.g., <m>0 = 0</m>).
