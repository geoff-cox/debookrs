			Differential equations are the cornerstone of mathematical modeling, enabling us to describe how systems change over time or space. From the motion of planets to the flow of electricity, they offer a powerful lens to interpret and predict the behavior of dynamic systems. This chapter is your gateway to understanding the foundational ideas and concepts that make differential equations indispensable in both science and engineering.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will start by exploring what a differential equation is and how it differs from standard equations. Along the way, we will uncover the basic terminology and classifications that help organize this vast field. These first steps will not only deepen your appreciation for the subject but also equip you with the tools to confidently approach and solve differential equations in a variety of contexts.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the end of this chapter, you will have a firm grasp of what differential equations are, their components, and the many forms their solutions can take. This foundational knowledge will prepare you for the more advanced techniques and methods explored in subsequent chapters.

	<section><title> What's a Differential Equation?</title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				In this introductory section, we will discuss what it means to be a differential equation. First with an analogy, then with a formal definition.
			</p>
			
		</introduction>

		<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xml:id="p1-c1-s1"><title> An Analogy </title>

			<p>
				When you learn something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for <m>y</m>.
			</p>
		
			<sidebyside>
				<p><me>y + 3 = 11</me></p>
				<p><me>y + 3x = 11</me></p>
				<p><me>y^\prime + 3x = 11</me></p>
			</sidebyside>
		
			<p>
				All three are equations with the same goal—finding the unknown <m>y</m>. However, only the third equation is a <em>differential equation</em> because it contains a derivative. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Now, let's try solving for <m>y</m> in each case.
			</p>
		
			<sidebyside>
		
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y + 3 =\amp\ 11	</mrow>
						<mrow>y 	=\amp\ 8	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y + 3x 	=\amp\ 11		</mrow>
						<mrow>y 		=\amp\ 11 - 3x	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y^\prime + 3x	=\amp\ 11		</mrow>
						<mrow>y^\prime 		=\amp\ 11 - 3x	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
		
			</sidebyside>
		
			<p>
				In the first equation, we found that <m>y</m> is a number, and in the second, it's a function of <m>x</m>. But in the last equation, how do we solve for <m>y</m> with a derivative attached to it? This is exactly the kind of question that differential equations aim to answer. 
			</p>
		
			<p>
				We'll dive deeper into solving these types of equations soon. For now, there's still plenty more to learn about the basics, so let's keep going!

		<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Definition </title>

			<p>
				Here is the formal definition of a differential equation.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="def-de">
				<title>Differential Equation</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. If the function depends on a single variable, the equation is an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>. 
						Otherwise, it is called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>
				
			<p>
				According to the definition, a differential equation must include at least one derivative (e.g., <m>f^\prime</m>, <m>dy/dx</m>) and an equality sign ("="). This distinction helps us identify the following expressions as differential equations:
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime)
				</me>
				In contrast, the following are not differential equations because they either lack a derivative or an equality sign:
				<me>
					\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0
				</me>

	<section><title> Variables, Terms, &amp; Coefficients </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Now that you know how to identify a differential equation, the next step is to familiarize yourself with its various components, such as variables, terms, and coefficients. This section will introduce you to these elements and define them within the context of differential equations. 
			</p>
			
		</introduction>
		<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>

			<p>
				Solving a differential equation amounts to finding an unknown function. Since every function depends on some variable, then a differential equation must represent both the function and this variable. For example, if the solution of a differential equation happened to be <m>y = \cos(2x)</m>, then that equation would be associated to both the <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> variables.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Now, consider the differential equation
				<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
				</men>
				Both <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> are in the equation, but which one represents the unknown function? If you recall from calculus, the term <m>dy/dx</m> says take the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>. This means that <m>y</m> must be the function which depends on <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In differential equations, we call the unknown variable, <m>y</m>, the <term>dependent variable</term> and <m>x</m> is known as the <term>independent variable</term>. 
			</p>

			<example xml:id="c1-s2-1-ex1">
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify the unknown function, as well as the dependent and independent variables.
						<me>
							\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\quad 
							u'' + t^2 u = 0,\quad 
							Q'' = 11Q
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The first equation contains both <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies
						<ul>
							<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
							<li><m>P</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
							<li><m>s</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>

					<p>
						The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> indicates the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So,
						<ul>
							<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> that must depend on the other variable <m>t</m>.</li>
							<li><m>u</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
							<li><m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> implies that <m>Q</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, if no independent variable is shown, the context of the problem may provide it. Otherwise, we can choose one ourselves—say <m>t</m>.
					</p>

			<p>
				As with any equation, a differential equation is made up of smaller parts called <q>terms</q>. When we refer to terms, we mean the parts that are separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs. For example, the differential equation 
				<men xml:id="de-terms-equation">
					\frac{3}{x}	y^{(6)} + 5.3 y'' + x^2 (y')^3 - y = \frac12\ln(x)
				</men>
				has five terms. Each term is associated to the dependent variable it contains. If a term does not contain a dependent variable, it is called a <term>constant term</term>. We can list out the terms in the equation above as follows:

			<p>
				As discussed, every dependent variable in a differential equation has a term that it is associated to. Additionally, within each term is a number or function multiplied by the dependent variable known as the <term>coefficient</term>. It is important to understand that, in the context of differential equations, a coefficient requires a dependent variable. Therefore, constant terms are not considered coefficients. 
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, each term in equation <xref ref="de-terms-equation"/> has the following coefficients:
				<tabular halign="center">
					<row>
						<cell><m>\ul{y^{(6)}\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ul{y''\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ul{(y')^3\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ul{y\text{ coefficient}}</m></cell><cell/>
					</row>
					<row>
						<cell><m>\ds \frac{3}{x}</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ds\vphantom{\frac11} 5.3</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ds\vphantom{\frac11} x^2</m></cell><cell/>
						<cell><m>\ds\vphantom{\frac11} -1</m></cell><cell/>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</p>

			<example xml:id="c1-s2-3-ex1">
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify the terms and coefficients in the equation
						<me>
							3t^2\ z' - 4\cos t + \frac{z'z}{t} - 515 z = -7.
						</me>
						
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Note, the dependent variable in this equation is <m>z</m>. Since the <m>- 4\cos t</m> and <m>-7</m> do not contain <m>z</m>, they can be combined as a single constant term on the right-hand side of the equation, like so
						<me>
							3t^2 z' + \frac{1}{t} z'z - 515 z = 4\cos t - 7.
						</me>
						So the terms and coefficients are as follows:
						<tabular halign="center">
							<row>
								<cell><m>\ul{z'\text{ term}}</m></cell><cell/>
								<cell><m>\ul{z'z\text{ term}}</m></cell><cell/>
								<cell><m>\ul{z\text{ term}}</m></cell><cell/>
								<cell><m>\ul{\text{constant term}}</m></cell>
							</row>
							<row>
