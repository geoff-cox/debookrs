		<p>
			Solve the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x. </me>
		</p>

		<solution>

			<p>
				The general solution to this differential equation is
				<me> y = Ce^{x^2} + 3. </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find the specific value of <m>C</m>, we need to use an initial condition. Let's say we know that <m>y(0) = 0</m>. This means that when <m>x = 0</m>, then <m>y = 0</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can substitute these values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> into our general solution and solve for <m>C</m>.
				<md>
					<mrow> y =\amp\  Ce ^{x^2} + 3	\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 0	=\amp\  Ce^{0^2} + 3</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp				\amp						 0	=\amp\  C + 3</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp				\amp						-3	=\amp\  C</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the particular solution that satisfies the differential equation and the initial condition is
				<me> y = -3e^{x^2} + 3. </me>
			</p>
			
		</solution>

        <p>
            In this example, we used the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m> to find the specific value of the constant <m>C</m> in the general solution. This allowed us to find a particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In the exercises that follow, you will have the opportunity to practice finding particular solutions using initial conditions.
