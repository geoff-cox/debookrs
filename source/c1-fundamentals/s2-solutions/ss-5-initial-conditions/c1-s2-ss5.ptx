<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Initial Conditions </title>

	<p>
		Since many differential equations have solutions that depend on time, the term <term>initial condition</term> refers to any starting information you have about the solution. A differential equation that includes at least one initial condition is called an <term>initial-valued problem (IVP)</term>. It's reasonable to have some initial information about the solution, as the next example illustrates.

	<example><title>Real World Initial Conditions</title>
		<p>
			An introductory physics problem is the free fall of an object due to gravity. Let <m>s(t)</m> be the position (distance from the ground) of this object at time <m>t</m>. Since acceleration is the second derivative of position, we get the DE
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<me>
				\text{acceleration of object} \rightarrow \quad s''(t) = -32 \text{ ft/s}^2.

			Assuming the ball is dropped from the top of a 100 ft building, what initial information do you know? That is, what are the initial conditions?
		</p>

		<answer>
			<p>
				You know the starting position and starting velocity of the ball. That is, you have the initial conditions
				<me>
					s(0) = 100 \text{ ft} \quad \text{and} \quad s'(0) = 0 \text{ ft/s}.
				</me>
			</p>
