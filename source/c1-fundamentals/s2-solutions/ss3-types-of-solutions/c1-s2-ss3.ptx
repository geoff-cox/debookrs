	<p>
		At this point, you should comfortable with the idea that <em> a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies it </em>. You have also seen that <xref ref="de-two-solutions" text="custom"> a single differential equation can have more than one solution </xref>. However, this begs the question: 
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em><q>How many solutions does a differential equation have?</q></em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		The answer depends on the context of the problem, and that's what we will explore in this section. Let's kick things off with an example.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="verification-with-a-constant">
		<m>\quad</m> Show that the functions 
		<me>y = e^{2x},\ \ y = 2e^{2x},\ \ y = 3e^{2x},\ \ y = -7e^{2x},\ \ y = 0.3e^{2x},\ \ y = \pi e^{2x} </me> 
		are solutions to the differential equation
		<m>\quad y' - 2y = 0</m>.
		<solution>
			
			<p>
				Verifying each function individually would be repetitive because they all follow the same pattern: 
				<me>y = (\text{some number})\ e^{2x} \quad \text{or} \quad y = c e^{2x} </me>, where <m>c</m> can be any constant. Let’s prove that <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution.
			</p>
			<p>
				First, compute <m>y'</m>:
				<md>
					<mrow>	y		=\amp\  c e^{2x}						</mrow>
					<mrow>	y'		=\amp\  2c e^{2x}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				Now, substitute <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> into the differential equation:
				<md>
					<mrow> 					y' - 2y	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2(c e^{2x})	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2c e^{2x}	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					<mrow> 						0	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
				</md>
				<p>
					Therefore, <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution, and the specific value of <m>c</m> does not matter.
				</p>
			</p>

		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		From the above example, you can see that the function <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> satisfies the differential equation for any value of <m>c</m>. This leads to an important observation:
		<blockquote>
			<em><q>How many choices for <m>c</m> are there?</q></em>
		</blockquote>
		<p>Of course, the answer is infinitely many! This means the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m> has an infinite number of solutions. This brings us to some key terms related to solutions of differential equations.</p>
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="types-of-solutions"><title>Types of Solutions</title>
		<statement>
			<dl>
				<li xml:id="family-of-solutions">
					<title>Family of Solutions</title>
					<p>The collection of all possible solutions of a differential equation.</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="general-solution">
					<title>General Solution</title>
					<p>The common form of all the solutions in the family. This includes arbitrary constants that can take any value.</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="particular-solution">
					<title>Particular Solution</title>
					<p>A single solution obtained by assigning specific values to the constants in the general solution.</p>
				</li>
			</dl>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Applying these terms to our previous example, we can summarize that:
		<ul>
			<li><m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is the <em>general solution</em> of the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m>.</li>
			<li><m>y = 5e^{2x}</m> is one <em>particular solution</em> in the <em>family of solutions</em>.</li>
			<li>The <em>family of solutions</em> consists of all functions of the form <m>y = c e^{2x}</m>.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Understanding the different types of solutions—general, particular, and families of solutions—is crucial as you continue to explore differential equations. In the upcoming sections, we'll talk more about where particular solutions come from.
