	<p>
		Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that <q>satisfies</q> the equation. The term <em>satisfies</em> simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true.
		<fn>This <q>undeniably true</q> statement is sometimes called an identity.</fn> 
		For example, suppose I want to check if <m>y=2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> are solutions to the equation 
		<me>
			y^3 = 3y + 2 
		</me>.
		To do this, we verify that both <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> <em>satisfy</em> the equation by separately plugging <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> in for each <m>y</m>, simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> (2)^3 	=\amp\ 3(2) + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 6 + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 8	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> (0)^3 	=\amp\ 3(0) + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 0 + 2								</mrow>
					<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 2	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		Since <m>y=2</m> yields an undeniably true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, <m>y=0</m> does not give a true statement, so it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.
	</p>

		The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that solutions are functions instead of numbers. To see this, let's verify if <m>y = 3x</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> are solutions to the differential equation
		<m>
			\displaystyle y^\prime = 3y
		</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Separately plugging <m>3x</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m> into the equation yields
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>				y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y									</mrow>
					<mrow> \left[3x\right]^\prime 	=\amp\ 3(3x)								</mrow>
					<mrow> 3 						=\amp\ 9x	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>							y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y										</mrow>
					<mrow> \left[e^{3x}\right]^\prime 			=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
					<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot \left[3x\right]^\prime	=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
					<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot 3						=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
					<mrow> 3e^{3x}								=\amp\ 3e^{3x}	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		Since <m>y=3x</m> results in a false statement, it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution. However, <m>y=e^{3x}</m> does satisfy the equation and is a solution.
