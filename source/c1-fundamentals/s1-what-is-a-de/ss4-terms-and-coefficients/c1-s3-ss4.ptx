<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Constant Coefficients </title>

	<p>
		Your first encounter with the quadratic formula likely taught you that the coefficients of the quadratic equation
		<me>
			ax^2 + bx + c = 0
		</me>
		are <m>a, b,</m> and <m>c</m>. In the context of differential equations, the <term>coefficients</term> are the <em>numbers or functions</em> multiplied by the dependent variable and its derivatives (<m>y^{(5)}, y'', y',</m> &amp; <m>y</m> below). For example, in the differential equation
		<me>
			\frac{3}{x}\ y^{(5)} + 5.3\ y'' + x^2\ y' + y = \frac12\ln(x)
		</me>,
		the coefficients are <m>\frac{3}{x},\ 5.3,\ x^2,</m> and <m>1</m>. Notice that the coefficients can be either functions of the independent variable (<m>\frac{3}{x}</m> and <m>x^2</m>) or constants (<m>5.3</m> and <m>1</m>). This distinction leads us to the next classification label.

	<definition><title> Constant Coefficients </title>
	
		<statement>
			<p>
				A differential equation is said to have <term> constant coefficients </term> if every coefficient in the equation is constant.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<example>

		<p>
			All of the differential equations, below, have constant coefficients.
		</p>
		<me>
			\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}y' = y, \quad s'''+\pi s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>

		<p>
			Whereas, the following differential equations do not:
		</p>
		<me>
			t\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}x y' = y, \quad s'''+ \cos(\pi w) s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>
