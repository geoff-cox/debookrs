<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Terms &amp; Coefficients </title>

	<p>
		In order to effectively understand and communicate concepts in differential equations, a solid foundation of the structural components of a differential equation is necessary. In addition to variables, discussed in the previous section, a differential equation also contains <term>terms</term> and <term>coefficients</term>. Let's explore these concepts further.    
	</p>

	<p>
		For this dicussion, suppose <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>t</m> is the independent variable. For any differential equation,
		<dl width="narrow">
			<li xml:id="de-terms"><title> Terms </title>
				<p>
					Parts in the equation that are separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs. 
				</p>
			</li>
			<li xml:id="de-coefficients"><title> Coefficients </title>
				<p>
					Numbers or functions of the independent variable, <m>t</m>, in each term.
				</p>
			</li>
		</dl>
		Any term that does not contain the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, or its derivatives is called a <term>constant term</term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Every term in a differential equation has a coefficient and is described in terms of the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, attached to it. For example, the equation,
		<me>
			{\color{blue} y''} + 3t^2{\color{blue} y'} + \frac{1}{t}{\color{blue} y'y} - 5{\color{blue} y} = 4\cos(t)
		</me>,
		has five terms and is described as follows:
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds y''</m> is the <q><m>y''</m> term</q> with coefficient <m>\ds 1</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds 3t^2{\color{blue} y'}</m> is the <q><m>y'</m> term</q> with coefficient <m>\ds 3t^2</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds \frac{1}{t}{\color{blue} y'y}</m> is the <q><m>yy'</m> term</q> with coefficient <m>\ds \frac{1}{t}</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds -5{\color{blue} y}</m> is the <q><m>y</m> term</q> with coefficient <m>\ds -5</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>\ds 4\cos(t)</m> is the <q>constant term</q> with coefficient <m>\ds 4\cos(t)</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice that the last term, <m>4\cos(t)</m>, is described as the <q>constant term</q>, even though it is a function of <m>t</m>. In this context, constant means the term is not a function of <m>y</m>. 
	</p>




	<!-- <me> 
		\left(\text{function of } t\right), \ \
		\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y }, \ \
		\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y' }, \ \
		\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y'' }, \ \ ...
	</me>
	where <m>{\color{blue} y }</m> is the dependent variable and <m>t</m> is the independent variable.	Here are a few examples of linear terms:
	<me>
		3, \quad 3t, \quad 2t^2{\color{blue} y }, \quad \sin(t){\color{blue} y' }, \quad \left(t^2 - \frac{1}{t}\right){\color{blue} y''' }, \quad e^{t}{\color{blue} y^{(7)} } 
	</me>.
	Note, the (function of <m>t</m>) in each term does not need to be linear, however there can be at most one dependent variable, <m>\big( {\color{blue} y}, {\color{blue} y'}, {\color{blue} y'''}, {\color{blue} y^{(7)}} \big)</m> in each term. -->
