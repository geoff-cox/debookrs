	<!-- <p>
		To effectively comprehend and convey concepts in differential equations, it is important to have a solid understanding of the structural components of a differential equation. In addition to the previously discussed variables, a differential equation also comprises <em>terms</em> and <em>coefficients</em>.
	</p> -->

	<p>
		Encounters with the quadratic equation often involve the concepts of terms and coefficients where the terms were the expressions separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs and coefficients are the numbers. In particular, the quadratic equation, 
		<me>
			\us{x^2 \text{ term}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ax^2}}} + 
			\us{x \text{ term}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{bx}}} + 
			\us{\text{term}}{\us{\text{constant}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{c}}}} = 0
		</me>,
		has three terms (<m>ax^2, bx,</m> and <m>c</m>) and three coefficients (<m>a, b,</m> and <m>c</m>). The term that does not contain the variable <m>x</m> is referred to as the <em>constant term</em>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In differential equations, <term>terms</term> are also the expressions separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs, but the <term>coefficients</term> must be multiplied by a dependent variable or one of its derivatives. If a term does not contain a dependent variable, it is referred to as a <term>constant term</term>. So, in the context of differential equations, <em>the constant term is not considered a coefficient</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		An example of a differential equation with five terms and 4 coefficients is
		<men xml:id="terms-and-coefficients-equation">
			\us{y^{(6)}	\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ \frac{3}{x}	{\color{blue}\ y^{(6)}	}	}	} +
			\us{y''		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		5.3	{\color{blue}\ y''		} 	}	} +
			\us{y' 		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		x^2	{\color{blue}\ y'		} 	}	} -
			\us{y 		\text{ term}	}{\us{\uparrow}{	{\color{blue}\ \ul{y}	} 	}	} =
			\us{\text{constant term}	}{\ub{\ \frac12\ln(x)\ 							}	}
		</men>,
		where <m>\frac{3}{x},\ 5.3,\ x^2, </m> and <m>1</m> are the coefficients. Notice that a coefficient can be a <em>function of the independent variable</em> <m>\big(\frac{3}{x}</m> &amp; <m>x^2\big)</m> or <em>constant</em> (<m>5.3</m> &amp; <m>1</m>). This distinction will be important later when we consider a group of equations that have constant coefficients.

	<example xml:id="terms-and-coefficients"><title> <em>Terms &amp; Coefficients in a Differential Equation</em> </title>
	
		<statement>
			<p>
				Identify the terms and coefficients of the differential equation
			</p>
			<me>
				3t^2\ y' - 4\cos t + \frac{y'y}{t} - 515 y = 0
			</me>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We label each term in the differential equation as shown,
				<me>
					\us{y' \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 3t^2{\color{blue} y'}\ }} -
					\us{\text{constant term}}{\ub{\ 4\cos t\ }} +
					\us{y'y \text{ term}}{\ub{\ \frac{1}{t}{\color{blue} y'y}\ }} - 
					\us{y \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 515{\color{blue} y}\ }} = 0
				</me>,
				and note that the coefficients are <m>\, \ds 3t^2,\ \frac{1}{t},\ \text{ and } \ -515 </m>.
