	<!-- <p>
		To effectively comprehend and convey concepts in differential equations, it is important to have a solid understanding of the structural components of a differential equation. In addition to the previously discussed variables, a differential equation also comprises <em>terms</em> and <em>coefficients</em>.
	</p> -->

	<p>
		Your first encounter with the quadratic formula likely introduced you to the concepts of terms and coefficients. The terms, in the equation, were the expressions separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs and the coefficients the numbers. In particular, the quadratic equation has the three terms and three coefficients,
		<me>
			\us{x^2 \text{ term}}{\us{\uparrow}{ax^2}} + 
			\us{x \text{ term}}{\us{\uparrow}{bx}} + 
			\us{\text{term}}{\us{\text{constant}}{\us{\uparrow}{c}}} = 0
		</me>,
		where <m>ax^2, bx,</m> and <m>c</m> are the terms with corresponding coefficients <m>a, b,</m> and <m>c</m>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In the context of differential equations, <term>terms</term> are also the expressions separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs and the <term>coefficients</term> are next to the dependent variable or its derivatives. If a term does not contain a dependent variable, it is referred to as a <term>constant term</term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		An example of a differential equation with five terms is given by
		<men xml:id="terms-and-coefficients-equation">
			\us{y^{(6)}	\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ \frac{3}{x}	{\color{blue}\ y^{(6)}	}	}	} +
			\us{y''		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		5.3	{\color{blue}\ y''		} 	}	} +
			\us{y' 		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		x^2	{\color{blue}\ y'		} 	}	} -
			\us{y 		\text{ term}	}{\us{\uparrow}{	{\color{blue}\ y		} 	}	} =
			\us{\text{constant term}	}{\ub{\ \frac12\ln(x)\ 							}	}
		</men>,
		and has coefficients <m>\frac{3}{x},\ 5.3,\ x^2,\ 1</m> and <m>\frac12\ln(x)</m>. Notice that the coefficients are either <em>functions of the independent variable</em> <m>\big(\frac{3}{x}</m> &amp; <m>x^2\big)</m> or <em>constants</em> (<m>5.3</m> &amp; <m>1</m>). This distinction will come up later when we consider differential equations that have constant coefficients.

		<statement>
			<p>
				The four terms of the nonlinear differential equation
			</p>
			<me>
				\us{y' \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 3t^2{\color{blue} y'}\ }} +

				\us{y \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 515{\color{blue} y}\ }} - 
				\us{\text{constant term}}{\ub{\ 4\cos t\ }} = 0
			</me>
			has the coefficients <m>\, \ds 3t^2,\ \frac{1}{t},\ -515,\ \text{ and } \ 4\cos t </m>.
			<fn>
				Even though <m>4\cos t</m> is a function of <m>t</m>, it is still considered constant with respect to the unknown function <m>y</m>.
