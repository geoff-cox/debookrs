		Imagine being in a library with thousands of books. To find the book you want, you need to understand how they are arranged. Just like books in a library are organized by genre, author, or subject, we classify differential equations to understand and solve them effectively. Placing such labels on differential equations is known as classification and is crucial for selecting the most suitable methods for solving them.
	</p>

	<p>
        One way to classify a differential equation is by the number of derivatives that are applied to the function we are solving for. Think of each derivative as a layer that we have to "peel off" to get to the function we want. Generally, the more derivatives there are, the more complex the solution will be.

    <definition xml:id="def-order">
        <statement>
            <p>
                The <term>order</term> of a differential equation is the highest <term>order</term> derivative that appears in the equation.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the highest derivative in an equation is the first derivative, we say the differential equation is <em>first-order</em>. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, we say it is <em>second-order</em>, and so on.

    <example xml:id="order-examples">
        <p>
            Give the order of each of the differential equations
		</p>

		<p>
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x, \quad x^2y'' + y''' = \sin x + y^8, \quad \frac{d^2A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17
			</me>
			<solution>
				<p>
					This differential equation has an order of 1 because the highest derivative in the equation is a first derivative. Therefore, it is called a "first-order differential equation".
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<p>
					This differential equation has an order of 3 because the highest derivative in the equation is a third derivative. Therefore, it is called a "third-order differential equation".
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The <m>y^8</m> term means that the dependent variable is raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the differential equation.
				</p>
			</solution>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Since the highest derivative is a second derivative, we say this is a second-order differential equation. <em>Notice that in this notation, the exponent indicates the second derivative.</em>
