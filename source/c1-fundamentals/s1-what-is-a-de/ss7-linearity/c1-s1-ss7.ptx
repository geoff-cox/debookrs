	<p>
		In the world of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is vital. This distinction will often guide you on how to approach solving the equation and what methods to use. The good news is, all the work we did in the previous section will make this task much easier.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be expressed as
			<men xml:id="linear-equation">
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
			</men>
			If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		This definition might seem abstract at first, but it encompasses all possible linear differential equations. In practice, most equations you'll encounter will involve only a few terms, and the challenge lies in identifying whether any of those terms break the rule of linearity. If they do, the equation is nonlinear.
	</p>

	<example>
		<m>\quad</m>Let's determine whether the following differential equation is linear:
		
		<me>y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t</me>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				To classify this equation, we need to verify if every term involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives is linear. Let's break it down term by term:
			</p>
			<md>
				<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\ 17t </mrow>
				<mrow> 
					\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y''}}} + 
					\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{\frac{1}{t^2} y'}}} + 
					\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y}}} = 
					\underset{\text{constant term}}{\underline{\color{blue}{17t}}}
				</mrow>
			</md>
			<p>
				Since each term involving <m>y</m> or its derivatives is linear, this differential equation is indeed linear.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	
	<p>
		In summary, recognizing whether a differential equation is linear or nonlinear will help you determine the appropriate methods for solving it. Linear equations allow for a more straightforward approach, while nonlinear equations often require specialized techniques.
