 Two large tanks, each holding 100 L of liquid, are interconnected by pipes, with the liquid flowing from tank 1 into tank 2 at a rate of 3 L/min and from tank 2 into tank 1 at a rate of 1 L/min.  The liquid inside each tank is kept well-stirred.  A brine solution with salt concentration of 0.01 kg/L flows into tank 1 at a rate of 4 L/min.  The (diluted) solution flows out of the system from tank 1 at 2 L/min and from tank 2 at 2 L/min.Initially, tank 1 contains pure water and tank 2 contains 6 kg of salt.

		<statement>
			A tank contains 100 liters of water. Salt is being added at a rate of 5 grams per minute. If the mixture is kept uniform by stirring and salt is being removed from the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute, set up the differential equation that models the amount of salt \(y(t)\) in the tank at any time \(t\). 
		</statement>
		<solution><title> Solution </title>
			<md>
				Let \(y(t)\) be the amount of salt in the tank at time \(t\). The rate of change of salt with respect to time, \(\frac{dy}{dt}\), is given by the rate of salt coming in minus the rate of salt going out. The rate of salt coming in is 5 grams/minute. The concentration of salt in the tank is \(\frac{y(t)}{100 - 2t}\) and thus the rate at which salt is removed from the tank is \(2 \times \frac{y(t)}{100 - 2t}\). Therefore, the differential equation is:
				<mrow>
					\frac{dy}{dt} \amp = 5 - 2 \frac{y(t)}{100 - 2t}
