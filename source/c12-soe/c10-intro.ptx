		Systems of differential equations are a collection of differential equations that are solved simultaneously. In this chapter, we will learn how to solve systems of differential equations using the Laplace transform. The Laplace transform is a powerful tool that allows us to solve differential equations (DEs) using algebra instead of calculus. This solution technique is particularly useful when the DEs are linear and have constant coefficients.

		We will start by discussing the Laplace transform and its properties. We will then learn how to apply the Laplace transform to solve systems of differential equations. We will also learn how to find the inverse Laplace transform to obtain the solution in the time domain.

	<p>
		We will work through several examples to illustrate the solution technique. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to solve systems of differential equations using the Laplace transform.
