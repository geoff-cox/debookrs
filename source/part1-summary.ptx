				<p>
					<dl>
						<li xml:id="summary-first-order-de"><title> First-Order Differential Equation </title>
							<p>
								Every first-order differential equation can be written in the form 
								<me>
									f(x, y, y') = 0
								</me>.
								This just means that all the terms in the equation have been moved to the left-hand side, which can only contain the independent variable, <m>x</m>, the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, and its derivative, <m>y'</m>.
							</p>
						</li>

			<assemblage><title> Direct Integration </title>
				<p>
					<dl>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-di"><title> Direct Integration </title>
							<p>
								A method to solve differential equations of the form:
								<me>
									\frac{d}{dx}\left[g(x,y)\right] = f(x),
								</me>
								by integrating both sides with respect to the independent variable <m>x</m>.

			<assemblage><title> Separation of Variables </title>
				<p>
					<dl>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-separable-de"><title> First-Order Separable Differential Equation </title>
							<p>
								These equations can be written as:
								<me>
									\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y).
								</me>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-sov"><title> Separation of Variables Method </title>
							<p>
								A solution technique for separable equations. It involves isolating <m>y</m> and <m>x</m> terms on opposite sides, followed by integration.
							</p>
						</li>

			<assemblage><title> Integrating Factor </title>
				<p>
					<dl>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-first-order-linear-de"><title> First-Order Linear Differential Equation </title>
							<p>
								These equations take the standard form:
								<me>
									y' + P(x)y = Q(x).
								</me>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-integrating-factor"><title> Integrating Factor </title>
							<p>
								A function, <m>\mu</m>, multiplied onto the standard form, above, to reverse the product rule, leading to the equation, <m>\mu' = P\mu</m>, with the solution
								<me>
									\mu = e^{\int P(x) dx}.
								</me>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="p1-summary-if"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>
							<p>
								A solution method for first-order linear equations that uses an integrating factor to convert the equation into a form solvable by direct integration.

		<task label="rename-this"><title> <em>Multiple-Choice</em> </title>
			<statement>
				<em>What is the method used to solve the differential equation <me>\frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y)] = f(x)</me>?</em>
			</statement>
			<choices>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>Direct integration.</statement>
					<feedback>Correct! The equation is solved by integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>.</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Separation of variables.</statement>
					<feedback>Incorrect. Separation of variables is used when the variables can be separated, but here the equation is solved by direct integration.</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Substitution.</statement>
					<feedback>Incorrect. Substitution is a different method. The correct method here is direct integration.</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Partial fractions.</statement>
					<feedback>Incorrect. Partial fractions are used to simplify the integration process, but the primary method here is direct integration.</feedback>
