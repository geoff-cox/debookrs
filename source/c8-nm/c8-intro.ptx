		Numerical methods are a collection of techniques used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. In this chapter, we will learn about some of the most common numerical methods used to solve differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		We will start by discussing Euler's method, a simple numerical technique for solving first-order ordinary differential equations. We will then move on to more advanced methods such as Runge-Kutta methods, which are used to solve higher-order differential equations and systems of differential equations.
