		This chapter delves into the concepts of approximation and explores some of the basic algorithms used to generate the numerical solutions to various differential equations.

		Numerical methods are a collection of techniques used to approximate solutions to mathematical problems that cannot be solved analytically. In this chapter, we will learn about some of the most common numerical methods used to solve differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		We will start by discussing Euler's method, a simple numerical technique for solving first-order ordinary differential equations. We will then move on to more advanced methods such as Runge-Kutta methods, which are used to solve higher-order differential equations and systems of differential equations.

		In practice, it is not uncommon to encounter a differential equations that is very difficult or even impossible to solve. For instance, consider the equation
		<men xml:id="riccati-eqn">
			y' = y^2 - x.
		</men>
		Though this equation may seem straightforward, the nonlinear term, <m>y^2</m>, makes solving it substantially more challenging. In fact, the solution <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is so complex, special functions were introduced to make it easier to represent.
		<fn>
			The solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is described by
			<me>
				y = \frac{ 3 x \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{4}{3}} \left( x \right) - c_1 J_{\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) + 2 J_{-\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) \right) + 2 c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}}\left( x \right) }{ (12 x)^{2/3} \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}} \left( x \right) + J_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(x \right) \right)}
			</me>
			where <m>J_n(x)</m> denotes a Bessel function defined as
			<me>
				J_n( x ) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \ \Gamma(m + n + 1)}\left( \frac{i}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^{2m + n}.
			</me>
		</fn>

		The reality is that the solutions to a large set of differential equations simply cannot be written in the form of a standard function (i.e., closed-form). Fortunately, there are ways to <q>substitute</q> the solution with an approximate solution, which are perfectly structured to be found by a computer.

		This section aims to explore the general concepts and terms used to describe the numerical methods covered in this chapter. By the end, you will have a solid grasp on many of the tools needed to implement the various algorithms that numerically solve differential equations.
