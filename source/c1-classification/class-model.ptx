	<title>Modeling with Classification</title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Understanding the order and linearity of a differential equation isn't just an academic exercise—it has practical implications for modeling real-world systems. The classification of a differential equation tells us about the complexity of the underlying phenomenon and guides us toward appropriate solution methods.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we'll explore how different types of differential equations arise from different physical contexts and learn to classify equations that model real systems.
		</p>

	<subsection>
		<title>The Problem: Spring-Mass Systems</title>

		<p>
			Consider a mass attached to a spring, suspended vertically. When you pull the mass down and release it, it oscillates up and down. The question is: can we predict the position of the mass at any given time?
		</p>

		<p>
			This seemingly simple system can be modeled with differential equations of different orders and linearity, depending on which physical effects we include.
		</p>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Assumptions and Model Variations</title>

		<p>
			<term>Basic Model (Linear, Second-Order):</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let <m>y(t)</m> represent the displacement of the mass from its equilibrium position at time <m>t</m>. The simplest model assumes:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The spring force is proportional to displacement (Hooke's Law): <m>F_{\text{spring}} = -ky</m></li>
			<li>There is no friction or air resistance</li>
			<li>The mass <m>m</m> is constant</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			By Newton's second law (<m>F = ma</m>), where <m>a = \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}</m> is acceleration:
			<me>
				m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} = -ky
			</me>
			or equivalently:
			<me>
				\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m}y = 0
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a <term>linear, homogeneous, second-order</term> differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Enhanced Model (Linear, Second-Order with Damping):</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			If we include air resistance or friction, which opposes motion proportionally to velocity:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Damping force: <m>F_{\text{damping}} = -c\frac{dy}{dt}</m></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The equation becomes:
			<me>
				m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + c\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = 0
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is still <term>linear and second-order</term>, but now includes a first derivative term representing damping.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Nonlinear Model (Second-Order):</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			For large displacements, the spring may not obey Hooke's Law perfectly. A more realistic spring force might be:
			<me>
				F_{\text{spring}} = -ky - \alpha y^3
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This leads to a <term>nonlinear</term> differential equation:
			<me>
				m\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + c\frac{dy}{dt} + ky + \alpha y^3 = 0
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Parameters:</term>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><m>m</m>: mass (kg)</li>
			<li><m>k</m>: spring constant (N/m), representing spring stiffness</li>
			<li><m>c</m>: damping coefficient (N·s/m)</li>
			<li><m>\alpha</m>: nonlinear spring coefficient</li>
		</ul>

		<title>Classification Activity</title>

		<p>
			<term>Objective:</term> Practice classifying differential equations from various physical contexts.
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Part 1: Classify These Equations</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			For each differential equation below, determine:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The order</li>
			<li>Whether it is linear or nonlinear</li>
			<li>If linear, whether it is homogeneous or nonhomogeneous</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<term>Equations to Classify:</term>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Population growth: <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = rP</m></li>
			<li>Radioactive decay: <m>\frac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N</m></li>
			<li>Logistic growth: <m>\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\left(1 - \frac{P}{K}\right)</m></li>
			<li>Forced harmonic oscillator: <m>m\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} + c\frac{dx}{dt} + kx = F_0\cos(\omega t)</m></li>
			<li>Pendulum (small angles): <m>\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L}\theta = 0</m></li>
			<li>Pendulum (large angles): <m>\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + \frac{g}{L}\sin\theta = 0</m></li>
			<li>RC circuit: <m>RC\frac{dV}{dt} + V = V_{\text{source}}(t)</m></li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<term>Part 2: Modeling Exercise</term>
		</p>

		<p>
			Working in groups, construct a simple spring-mass system:
		</p>

		<p>
			<term>Materials:</term>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A spring</li>
			<li>Various masses (washers, weights, etc.)</li>
			<li>A ruler or measuring tape</li>
			<li>A timer</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			<term>Procedure:</term>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Hang the spring vertically and measure its natural (unstretched) length.</li>
			<li>Attach a known mass and measure the new equilibrium length. The difference gives the stretch <m>\Delta y</m>.</li>
			<li>Use <m>mg = k\Delta y</m> to estimate the spring constant <m>k</m>.</li>
			<li>Pull the mass down slightly and release it. Time 10 complete oscillations and calculate the period <m>T</m>.</li>
			<li>Repeat with different masses.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<term>Data Analysis:</term>
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a table with mass, stretch, and period for each trial.</li>
			<li>Calculate the spring constant <m>k</m> from each mass-stretch measurement.</li>
			<li>Plot the period <m>T</m> versus mass <m>m</m>. What relationship do you observe?</li>
			<li>The theoretical period for a spring-mass system is <m>T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}</m>. Does your data support this?</li>
		</ol>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Analytical Questions</title>

		<ol>
			<li>Why is the basic spring-mass equation second-order? What physical quantity is represented by the second derivative?</li>
			<li>How does adding damping change the classification? Does it change the order or linearity?</li>
			<li>What makes the large-angle pendulum equation nonlinear? How might this affect its behavior compared to the small-angle case?</li>
			<li>If you wanted to model a spring-mass system on the surface of the Moon (where gravity is weaker), which parameters would change?</li>
			<li>Can you think of other physical systems that might be modeled by second-order differential equations?</li>
		</ol>
	</subsection>

	<subsection>
		<title>Final Report</title>

		<p>
			Write a comprehensive report (2-3 pages) that includes:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>A comparison of the three spring-mass models (basic, damped, nonlinear), discussing how assumptions affect the classification.</li>
			<li>Your experimental data, including calculations of the spring constant and analysis of the period-mass relationship.</li>
			<li>Answers to the classification questions in Part 1 of the activity, with detailed reasoning.</li>
			<li>A discussion of when a linear model might be sufficient versus when a nonlinear model is necessary.</li>
			<li>Real-world examples of systems modeled by equations of different orders and linearity.</li>
		</ol>
	</subsection>

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			Classification is the first step in understanding a differential equation. By recognizing whether an equation is first-order or second-order, linear or nonlinear, we can anticipate its behavior and select appropriate solution techniques. The spring-mass system demonstrates how the same physical scenario can yield different equations depending on our modeling assumptions—and how those choices affect the mathematical classification.
