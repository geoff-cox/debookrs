	<p>
		A differential equation must contain at least one derivative, but there is no limit on how many derivatives can appear. 
		Some equations involve just a first derivative, while others include higher-order derivatives like <m>y''</m>, <m>y^{(3)}</m>, or beyond.
	</p>

	<p>
		To capture this idea, we define the <term>order</term> of a differential equation as the highest derivative of the 
		dependent variable that appears in the equation.
	</p>

	<exercise label="order-linearity-cyu-1">

		<statement>
			<p>
				The order of a differential equation is determined by the number of terms it contains.
			</p>
		</statement>

		<choices randomize="yes">
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						True
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>
						Incorrect. The order is based on the highest derivative, regardless of the number of terms.

			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>
					<p>
						False
					</p>
				</statement>

						Correct! The order is determined by the highest derivative, not the number of terms.

	<p>
		For example, the equation
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</me>
		is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. On the other hand, the differential equation
		<me>
			x^2y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8
		</me>
		is <em>third-order</em> because it contains up to the third derivative in the <m>y'''</m> term.

	<example>
		<title>Identify the Order</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				For each of the following differential equations, identify the order:
				<me>
				\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17, \qquad w^6 + \sin\big(w^{(5)}\big) = 0
				</me>
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation is <em>second-order</em> because the highest derivative of <m>A</m> is <m>\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				A common pitfall for beginners is to confuse exponents with derivatives. In the second equation, the exponent in the term <m>w^6</m> 
				refers to <m>w</m> raised to the sixth power, not a sixth derivative. Only derivatives affect the order.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, the second equation is <em>fifth-order</em>. The fact that it appears inside a sine function does not affect the order.
			</p>
		</solution>
