	<title>Subscript Notation</title>

	<p>
		In calculus and differential equations, functions are usually written using parentheses. For example:
	</p>

	<me>f(x) = x^2 + 3x + 2, \qquad g(x) = x^5 \sin(x)</me>

	<p>
		These definitions tell us how to evaluate the function for different inputs. We can plug in any real number:
	</p>

	<md>
		<mrow>f(7) \amp = 7^2 + 3 \cdot 7 + 2 = 72</mrow>
		<mrow>f(-1.3) \amp = (-1.3)^2 + 3 \cdot (-1.3) + 2 = -0.21</mrow>
		<mrow>f(w) \amp = w^2 + 3w + 2</mrow>
		<mrow>f(x+5) \amp = (x+5)^2 + 3(x+5) + 2</mrow>
		<mrow>\amp = x^2 + 13x + 42</mrow>
	</md>

		<title>Subscript notation</title>

		<p>
		When the inputs to a function are restricted to whole numbers like <m>n = 0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots</m>, we often use <em>subscript notation</em>. This is especially common when working with sequences or numerical methods that step through time.
		</p>

		<p>
		For example, suppose we define a function using subscript notation:
		</p>
		<me>a_n = n^2 + 3n + 2</me>

		<p>
		This behaves similarly to <m>f(x)</m>, except that <m>n</m> must be a nonnegative integer. We would not evaluate <m>a_n</m> at a value like <m>-1.3</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
		Here are some values of the sequence:
		</p>
		<md>
		<mrow>a_0 \amp = 0^2 + 3\cdot 0 + 2 = 2</mrow>
		<mrow>a_1 \amp = 1^2 + 3\cdot 1 + 2 = 6</mrow>
		<mrow>a_{13} \amp = 13^2 + 3\cdot 13 + 2 = 210</mrow>
		<mrow>a_{200} \amp = 200^2 + 3\cdot 200 + 2 = 40602</mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
		You’ll see subscript notation again when we use Euler’s method later in this course, where we write approximations as <m>y_0, y_1, y_2, \ldots</m> to represent the values of a function at evenly spaced time steps.
