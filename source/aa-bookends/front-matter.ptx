		<introduction>
			<p>
				This book was written with a simple goal: to help you learn differential equations in a way that feels approachable, logical, and connected to the real world. Too often, students encounter differential equations as a blur of techniques and formulas, each with its own quirks and conditions, without seeing the bigger picture. I wanted to write something different—a book that explains not only <em>how</em> the methods work, but also <em>why</em> they exist, when to use them, and what they tell us about the systems they describe.
			</p>

			<p>
				From the start, we take the time to answer the deceptively simple question: what is a differential equation? We build up the vocabulary—order, linearity, coefficients—that you'll need to make sense of every chapter that follows. Then we move step by step through the main families of techniques: separation of variables, integrating factors, and methods for solving linear equations with constant coefficients. Each method is introduced in context, not just as a recipe, so you understand the logic behind the steps rather than memorizing them blindly.
			</p>

			<p>
				But this book isn't only about solutions you can write down neatly. Some of the most interesting and important differential equations can't be solved with a clean formula. That's where we shift focus to <em>qualitative methods</em>—tools like slope fields, phase lines, and equilibrium analysis that reveal how solutions behave without ever finding them explicitly. Later, we introduce <em>numerical methods</em> like Euler's method, showing how computers approximate solutions when analytic methods run out. These chapters are as much about mindset as they are about mechanics.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we move into higher-order equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of differential equations, the narrative grows but the tone stays the same: conversational, patient, and realistic about what's challenging. Each topic is broken into digestible parts, with worked examples, quick-reference summaries, and guiding comments that aim to make the path through this subject a little clearer.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book is not meant to overwhelm you with theory, nor to flatten the subject into a list of disconnected tricks. Instead, it aims to be a <q>tour guide</q>—helping you see the terrain of differential equations, pointing out landmarks, and showing you where different paths lead. If you are an engineer, physicist, mathematician, or simply curious about how we model the world, I hope this book helps you not just <em>do</em> differential equations, but genuinely understand them.
			</p>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>Textbook Aim &amp; Scope</title>
			<p>
				This book is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their applications. It covers the fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques used to solve ODEs, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving skills.
			</p>

			<p>
				This interactive online text is intended to be used to learn the introductory concepts of ordinary differential equations. The book is designed for students who have completed single-variable calculus and is suitable for a one semester course in differential equations. The book is written in a straightforward, readable style and has a large number of worked examples and exercises.
			</p>
		</paragraphs>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>Intended Audience</title>
			<p>
				This book is intended for undergraduate students who are studying differential equations for the first time. It is designed to be accessible to students with a background in single-variable calculus, and it assumes no prior knowledge of differential equations. The book is suitable for use in a one-semester course on ordinary differential equations.
			</p>
		</paragraphs>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>Philosophy</title>
			
			<p>
				We believe that the best way to learn differential equations is to work through examples and exercises. This book is designed to be interactive, allowing you to explore the concepts and methods of differential equations in a hands-on way. We encourage you to work through the examples and exercises, and to use the interactive features of the book to deepen your understanding.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also believe that it is important to understand the underlying concepts and methods of differential equations, rather than just memorizing formulas and techniques. This book is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of the subject, so that you can apply the concepts and methods to a wide range of problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				We hope that this book will be a valuable resource for you as you learn differential equations, and that it will help you develop the skills and understanding you need to succeed in your studies and future career.	
			</p>
		</paragraphs>

		<paragraphs>
			<title>Textbook Structure and Approach</title>
			
			<p>
				The book is structured to guide you through the process of solving differential equations, starting with the basic concepts and building up to more advanced techniques. Each section includes examples and exercises that illustrate the concepts and methods, and we encourage you to work through these examples and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of the material.
			</p>

			<p>
				Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.

			Differential equations sit at the heart of how we describe change. Whether we're tracking the spread of a disease, predicting the motion of a planet, or modeling the charge in an electrical circuit, differential equations provide the language and the structure to make sense of how systems evolve. They connect the algebra you already know with the calculus you've learned, and they open the door to ideas that reach across science, engineering, and beyond.
		</p>

		<p>
			This book is designed to guide you through that world step by step. We begin with the basics—what a differential equation is, how to classify it, and what it means to solve one. From there, we explore the core solution methods for first-order equations, building intuition before moving into more advanced topics such as higher-order equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of equations. Along the way, you'll see not only <em>how</em> to solve different types of problems, but also <em>why</em> the methods work and when each tool is the right one to use.
		</p>

		<p>
			But not every equation has a neat solution you can write down. That's why this book also covers <em>qualitative methods</em> for understanding solution behavior and <em>numerical methods</em> for approximating solutions when analytic solutions are unavailable. These approaches shift the focus to the broader picture: what the solutions mean, how they behave, and what they reveal about the systems they describe.
		</p>

		<p>
			Above all, this book aims to stay approachable and conversational. You'll find worked examples, visual tools, and quick-reference summaries to help you along the way. Whether you are here as a mathematician, an engineer, a scientist, or simply someone curious about how mathematics explains the world, this book will help you not just solve differential equations, but truly understand them.
