		<statement>
			After substituting <m> y_p = Ax + B </m> into the equation <m> y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x </m>, you find the system of equations:
			<me>3A = 9</me> and <me>-4A + 3B = 0</me>.
			What are the values of <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement> <m> A = 3, B = 4 </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Correct! Solving the system yields <m> A = 3 </m> and <m> B = 4 </m>.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> A = 1, B = 2 </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. Double-check your algebra when solving the system of equations.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> A = 3, B = 0 </m> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. While <m> A </m> is correct, you need to solve for <m> B </m> as well.</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <m> A = 2, B = 4 </m> </statement>

		<statement>
			<p>Which of the following is NOT a step in finding the coefficients of the particular solution?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement> <p>Plugging <m> y_p </m> into the differential equation.</p> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This is the first step in determining the coefficients.</feedback>

			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement> <p>Collecting and matching like-terms.</p> </statement>
				<feedback>Incorrect. This is a crucial step for finding the values of <m> A </m> and <m> B </m>.</feedback>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s5-rq5"><title> <em>Consider the equation..</em> </title>
		<statement>
			Consider the equation <men>y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x</men>. If the particular solution is assumed to be <me>y_p = Ax + B</me>, which of the following represents the correct coefficient-matching equations when substituting into the differential equation?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement> <p><m>3A = 9, -4A + 3B = 9</m></p> </statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Remember to match coefficients of like-terms separately (i.e., coefficients of <m>x</m> and constant terms).</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement> <p><m>3A = 9, -4A + 3B = 0</m></p> </statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! Matching coefficients of <m>x</m> gives <m>3A = 9</m>, and matching constant terms gives <m>-4A + 3B = 0</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement> <p><m>A = 9, -4A + B = 0</m></p> </statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Re-check the coefficients and ensure you match the terms correctly.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement> <p><m>3A = 3, -4B + A = 9</m></p> </statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Verify which terms correspond to coefficients of <m>x</m> and the constant terms.</p>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s5-rq6"><title> <em>Why do we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying terms by <m>x</m> when there is overlap with <m>y_h</m>?</em> </title>
		<statement>
			<p>Why do we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying terms by <m>x</m> when there is overlap with <m>y_h</m>?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>To make the computation of derivatives easier.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The adjustment is not made for the ease of differentiation but to ensure the independence of terms.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>To ensure that <m>y_p</m> and <m>y_h</m> remain independent.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! Multiplying by <m>x</m> ensures that the particular solution does not overlap with the homogeneous solution.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>To match the degree of the polynomial in <m>f(x)</m>.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. While the degree of <m>y_p</m> is related to <m>f(x)</m>, the adjustment addresses overlap with <m>y_h</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>To simplify the resulting system of equations.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The adjustment is made to maintain independence between <m>y_p</m> and <m>y_h</m>, not for simplification purposes.</p>

	<exercise label="p3-c2-s5-rq7"><title> <em>Suppose <me>y'' - 4y' + 3y = 6e^x</me>. Which of the following is the correct initial guess for <m>y_p</m>?</em> </title>
		<statement>
			Suppose <me>y'' - 4y' + 3y = 6e^x</me>. Which of the following is the correct selection for <m>y_p</m>?
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement><m>y_p = Ae^x</m></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Remember to consider whether <m>e^x</m> overlaps with any terms in <m>y_h</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement><m>y_p = Axe^x</m></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! Since <m>e^x</m> is a term in <m>y_h</m>, we need to multiply the particular solution by <m>x</m> to ensure independence.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement><m>y_p = Ax + B</m></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. This form is more suited for a polynomial right-hand side like <m>f(x) = 6x</m>.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement><m>y_p = A</m></statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. A constant form of <m>y_p</m> would only be appropriate if <m>f(x)</m> were a constant.</p>

		<statement>
			<p>What are the main steps for finding <m>y_p</m> using the method of undetermined coefficients?</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>Select the particular solution, integrate it, and solve for coefficients.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Integration is not a part of the method of undetermined coefficients.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>Select the particular solution, adjust it if necessary, and find its coefficients.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Correct! The process involves making an educated guess, substituting it, and solving for unknown coefficients.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>Select the homogeneous solution, adjust for <m>y_p</m>, and differentiate.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. The focus is on selecting and solving for <m>y_p</m>, not guessing the homogeneous solution.</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="no">
				<statement>Choose <m>y_p</m>, integrate the result, and verify the solution.</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>Incorrect. Integration is not a step in this method; it's about solving for coefficients of <m>y_p</m>.</p>
