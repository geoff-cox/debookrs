	<subsection><title> Selecting Particular Solutions </title>

		<p>
			As discussed in the previous section, solving non-homogeneous linear differential equations involves finding a solution that satisfies the equation:
			<me>
				a_n y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2 y'' + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
			</me>.
			The challenge is that the terms on the left side need to combine in just the right way to match <m>f(x)</m> on the right. This means the form of the particular solution must resemble <m>f(x)</m> closely. When <m>f(x)</m> contains polynomial, exponential, or trigonometric (sine or cosine) terms, the particular solution should involve similar components.
		</p>

		<p>
			The specific function that accounts for <m>f(x)</m> on the right side is known as the <term>particular solution</term>, denoted <m>y_p</m>. The form of this solution depends on the type of function <m>f(x)</m> represents. To help select the correct form of <m>y_p</m>, refer to <xref ref="yp-table"/>, which outlines the most common types of <m>f(x)</m> and their corresponding <m>y_p</m> forms.

			In this table, the constants <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, <m>d</m>, <m>\alpha</m>, and <m>\beta</m> are assumed to be known, while <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc., need to be determined. We will explore how to determine these coefficients in the next section. For now, we are concerned with picking the correct form. Let's work through a few examples to solidify this process.

			<solution>
				<ol marker="A.">
					<li>
						<p>
							Since the constant term, <m>f(x) = 3e^{6x}</m>, has the form <m>a e^{\alpha x}</m>, we set 
							<me>
								y_p = Ae^{6x}
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since the constant term, <m>2\sin(2x)</m>, has the form <m>a \sin(\beta x)</m>, so

					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since the constant term, <m>5\theta^2 + \theta + 1</m> has the form <m>a\theta^2+b\theta+c</m>, so

						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Here, the constant term, <m>3</m>, is not on the right. Nevertheless, it can be moved over and since it has the form <m>a</m>, we get

								y_p = A
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Even though <m>f(x) = 14x^4</m> only has an <m>x^4</m> term, the solution can contain any terms of a 4th-degree polynomial, so

								y_p = Ax^4+Bx^3+Cx^2+Dx+E

						</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			When <m>f(x)</m> is a sum of multiple functions, each part of the sum contributes to the form of the particular solution. In these situations, we construct <m>y_p</m> by simply adding together the particular solutions corresponding to each term in <m>f(x)</m>. Let's look at an example to clarify this approach.
		</p>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - Sum of Forms </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Use <xref ref="yp-table"/> to determine the initial form of <m>y_p</m> for each equation below.
						<ol marker="A.">
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds y'' + 2y' + 3y = 2e^{w} - 1</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds u'' - u = 3\sin(2\theta) + 4\cos(2\theta)</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds \omega''' + \omega' = 5e^{3w} - 2\sin(4w)</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds P' + 5P = 2\cos(-3t) - 4\cos(5t)</m>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								Since the constant term is the sum of <m>2e^{w}</m> and <m>-1</m>, we set
								<me>
									y_p = Ae^{w} + B
								</me>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								In this case, we have the sum of <m>3\sin(2\theta)</m> and <m>4\cos(2\theta)</m>, but this is already in <xref ref="yp-table"/>, so we set it as usual:
								<me>
									y_p = A\sin(2\theta) + B\cos(2\theta)
								</me>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Since the constant term is the sum of an <m>e^{3w}</m> and a <m>\sin(4w)</m>,
								<me>
									y_p = Ae^{3w} + B\sin(4w) + C\cos(4w)
								</me>.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								Since the constant term is the sum of non-like cosine terms, we must add both of their forms to the initial <m>y_p</m>, like so
								<me>
									y_p = A\sin(-3t) + B\cos(-3t) + C\sin(5t) + D\cos(5t)
								</me>.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<p>
			When <m>f(x)</m> involves products of functions, constructing <m>y_p</m> can become more involved. This is because multiplying terms may introduce extra coefficients that turn out to be unnecessary or redundant. In these cases, simplifying the solution to avoid duplication is essential. The following example illustrates this process.
		</p>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - A Product of Forms </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Use <xref ref="yp-table"/> to determine the initial form of <m>y_p</m> for the equation
						<me>
							y'' + y' + 5y = 10x^2 e^{6x}
						</me>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Since <m>f(x) = 10x^2 e^{6x}</m> is the product of a polynomial and an exponential, we initially set:
					<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x})</me>.
					However, <m>D</m> is redundant because if we multiply it onto the polynomial, it can be absorbed into <m>A, B, </m> and <m>C</m>, as follows:
					<me>y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x}) = \left(AD x^2 + BD x + CD\right) e^{6x}</me>.
					So, the form of <m>y_p</m> simplifies to:
					<me>y_p = \left(A x^2 + B x + C\right) e^{6x}</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - More Products of Forms </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Use <xref ref="yp-table"/> to set-up the initial form of <m>y_p</m> for each equation and combine any coefficients when possible.
						<ol marker="A.">
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds y'' + y = e^{-x}\cos(x)</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>

								</p>

								</p>

						</ol>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>e^{-x}\cos(x)</m> is the product of an exponential and a cosine function, we initially set
							<me>
								y_p = Ae^{-x}(B\sin x + C\cos x)
							</me>.
							However, multiplying this expression out shows <m>A</m> can be absorbed into <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>, so we simplify it as
							<me>
								y_p = e^{-x}(B\sin x + C\cos x)
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>e^{6x}e^{-2x}</m> is the same as <m>e^{4x}</m>, we don't have to do anything special here. The initial form of <m>y_p</m> is just
							<me>
								y_p = Ae^{4x}
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Since <m>t^{3}\cos(t)</m> is the product of a polynomial and a cosine function, we set the initial form of <m>y_p</m> as the product
							<me>
								Q_p = (At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D)(E\sin t + F\cos t). \qquad \text{1️⃣}
							</me>
							Multiplying the polynomial onto sine and cosine, gives us
							<md>
								<mrow>	Q_p = (At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct	\amp + D)E\sin t						</mrow>
								<mrow>							\amp + (At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D)F\cos t	</mrow>

								<mrow>							\amp + (AFt^3 + BFt^2 + CFt + DF)\cos t	</mrow>
							</md>,
							which shows that <m>E</m> and <m>F</m> can be absorbed into <m>A, B, C</m>, and <m>D</m>. Relabeling all <m>8</m> of these coefficients, we get the alternative form
							<md>
								<mrow>	Q_p = (At^3 + Bt^2	\amp + Ct + D)\sin t						</mrow>
								<mrow> 						\amp + (Et^3 + Ft^2 + Gt + H)\cos t.	\quad \text{2️⃣}</mrow>
							</md>
							Although forms 1️⃣ &amp; 2️⃣ are both correct, when we start solving equations, form 2️⃣ will usually be easier to work with. 
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							This one is tricky, but as long as the initial form of one term covers all the others, then you can ignore the other terms. For example, the general form for, <m>x^2\cos x</m>, is
							<md>
								<mrow>	y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C) (D\sin x + E\cos x)	</mrow>
							</md>,
							or alternatively,
							<me>
								y_p = (Ax^2 + {\color{RoyalBlue}Bx} + C){\color{RoyalBlue}\sin x} + (Dx^2 + Ex + F)\cos x

							showing <m>{\color{RoyalBlue}x\sin x}</m> is captured in this form as well, so we are done.

	<subsection><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>

		<p>
			As discussed in the previous sections, the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, and the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. This relationship is expressed as:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p
			</me>.
			However, it is possible for the particular solution to contain terms that overlap with those in the homogeneous solution. When this occurs, parts of the particular solution can be absorbed into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that does not accurately match the nonhomogeneous term on the right-hand side of the equation. This section highlights this issue and provides a strategy to resolve it.
		</p>

		<p>
			To illustrate this, consider the LNCC equation:
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}
			</me>.
			Here, the homogeneous and particular solutions are:
			<me>
				y_h = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x}, \qquad y_p = A e^{3x}
			</me>.
			The problem arises when you observe that <m>Ae^{3x}</m> in <m>y_p</m> is similar to <m>c_2 e^{3x}</m> in <m>y_h</m>, causing the general solution to become:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x} + A e^{3x} = c_1 e^{x} + (c_2 + A) e^{3x}.
			</me>
			As a result, the particular solution effectively vanishes into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that fails to reflect the nonhomogeneous term <m>e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To address this, we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> until there are no overlapping terms between <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. In this example, multiplying <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> once is sufficient to make it independent of <m>y_h</m>. The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is:
			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<theorem><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					When the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, contains terms in common with the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by repeatedly multiplying the overlapping terms by <m>x</m> until <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> share no terms in common.
				</p>
			</statement>

	<subsection><title> Method Steps </title>

		<p>
			When solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation, selecting the correct form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, is just the beginning. The next step is determining the values of its unknown coefficients, such as <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. In this section, we'll explore how to compute these coefficients by substituting the guessed particular solution into the original equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's revisit the example we discussed earlier. Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="finding-yps-coefficients-de">
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</men>.
			We guessed that the particular solution would be linear, so we set
			<me>
				y_p = Ax + B
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our goal now is to determine the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. To do this, we substitute <m>y_p = Ax + B</m> into the original differential equation. Here's how it works:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow> y_p = Ax + B \quad \implies \quad y_p' = A \quad \implies \quad y_p'' = 0 </mrow>
		</md>
		<p>
			Substituting <m>y_p</m>, <m>y_p'</m>, and <m>y_p''</m> into <xref ref="finding-yps-coefficients-de"/> results in:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow> 0 - 4A + 3(Ax + B) =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> -4A + 3Ax + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 3Ax -4A + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
		</md>
		<p>
			Next, we match the <m>x</m> coefficients and the constants on opposite sides of the equation,
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 3A	  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ -4A + 3B}}} =\amp\ 
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 9		  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ 0		 }}}
			</mrow>
		</md>.			
		<p>
			This gives us two equations to solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
		</p>
		<sidebyside widths="20% 35% 10% 15% 20%" valigns="top top middle top top">
			<p/>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>\text{🏵️}: \hspace{5.25em}	3A		\amp = 9</mrow>
					<mrow>\text{💎}: \qquad -4A + 3B	\amp = 0</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>
					\implies
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>	A \amp = 3</mrow>
					<mrow>	B \amp = 4</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			Thus, the particular solution is:
		</p>
		<me>
			y_p = 3x + 4
		</me>.

		<p>
			Regardless of <m>y_p</m>'s form, the process of finding the coefficients remains consistent:
			<ul marker="square">
				<li><p>Substitute the chosen <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Collect and match coefficients of like-terms on both sides of the equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Solve the resulting system to find <m>A, B, C, \ldots</m>.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is why the method is called the "method of undetermined coefficients." and the complete process is summarized as follows.
