<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Method of Undetermined Coefficients </title>
	
	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we established that the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation consists of two parts: the <em>homogeneous solution</em> <m>y_h</m> and the <em>particular solution</em> <m>y_p</m>. While <m>y_h</m> is found by solving the characteristic equation of the corresponding homogeneous equation, finding <m>y_p</m> requires a different approach.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> is a systematic technique for determining <m>y_p</m> when the nonhomogeneous term, <m>f(x)</m>, has a specific form. Instead of solving for <m>y_p</m> directly, we first assume its general structure based on the form of <m>f(x)</m>, then determine the unknown coefficients by substituting <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation and solving for them.
		</p>

		<p>
			One limitation of this method is that it only works when <m>f(x)</m> is:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li><p>A Polynomial, such as <m>f(x) = 2x^2 + x - 4</m></p></li>
			<li><p>An Exponential function, such as <m>f(x) = 5 e^{2 x}</m></p></li>
			<li><p>Sine or Cosine functions, such as <m>f(x) = \sin(\pi x) - 3\cos(\pi x)</m></p></li>
			<li><p>Any sum or product of these function types</p></li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Nevertheless, when applicable, it provides a straightforward and efficient way to determine the general solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, we will develop the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> by first identifying how to select an appropriate form for <m>y_p</m>, then learning how to adjust <m>y_p</m> when it conflicts with <m>y_h</m>. Finally, we will apply the full method to solve LNCC equations step by step.
		</p>
	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> Selecting Particular Solutions </title>

		<p>
			The first step in the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em> is selecting an appropriate form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. Since <m>y_p</m> is responsible for generating the nonhomogeneous term <m>f(x)</m> when substituted into the differential equation, it must be structured in a way that allows differentiation to produce terms that match those in <m>f(x)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Unlike the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m>, which is determined by solving the characteristic equation, <m>y_p</m> is not obtained through direct computation. Instead, we assume a general form for <m>y_p</m> that mirrors the function type of <m>f(x)</m>, introducing unknown coefficients that will be determined later by substitution into the differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			The general principle for choosing <m>y_p</m> can be described as:
		</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<em>The particular solution <m>y_p</m> must have the same structure as <m>f(x)</m>, ensuring that differentiation produces terms capable of matching this function on the right-hand side.</em>
			</p>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			This means that if <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial or exponential, for example, then <m>y_p</m> should take a similar form. The table below provides a guide for selecting <m>y_p</m> (<em>right column</em>) based on the type of forcing function, <m>f(x)</m> (<em>left column</em>). 
		</p>

		<aside>
			<p>
				The coefficients (<m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, etc.) will be found later by plugging <m>y_p</m> into our DE. For now, we are focused on selecting the correct form of <m>y_p</m>.

		<note><title> Include all possible terms in the selected form </title>
			<p>
				When you select a function type in the left column, make sure to include all terms in the right column even if <m>f(x)</m> lacks that term. For example:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						If <m>f(x) = x^2 + 1</m>, it may be tempting to set <m>y_p = Ax^2 + B</m> since <m>f(x)</m> lacks an <m>x</m> term. However, <m>y_p</m> must account for all degree 2 polynomial terms, including <m>x</m>. So, <m>y_p=Ax^2 + Bx + C</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Similarly, if <m>f(x) = \cos(3x)</m>, then <m>y_p = A\cos(3x) + \ul{B\sin(3x)}</m>! This ensures that differentiation produces all terms needed to match <m>f(x)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</note>

		<p>
			If <m>f(x)</m> consists of a sum of different function types (e.g., a polynomial plus an exponential), the particular solution <m>y_p</m> must also be a sum of the corresponding forms. Each term in <m>y_p</m> should independently match its counterpart in <m>f(x)</m>.

		</example>

		<p>
			When <m>f(x)</m> is a product of function types (such as a polynomial times an exponential), <m>y_p</m> should be chosen as a product of their corresponding forms. The tricky part here is that multiplication often introduces unnecessary coefficients that can overly complicate your problem if not simplified. The next example illustrates this situation and addresses how to handle it.
		</p>

		<example><title> Initial form of <m>y_p</m> - A Redundant Coefficient </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Use <xref ref="yp-forms-table"/> to determine the initial form of <m>y_p</m> for the equation
						<me>
							y'' + y' + 5y = 10x^2 e^{6x}
						</me>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Since <m>f(x) = 10x^2 e^{6x}</m> is the product of a polynomial and an exponential, logically we would set <m>y_p</m> as
				</p>

				<me>
					y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x})
				</me>.

				<p>
					However, <m>D</m> is unnecessary because if we multiply this expression out, <m>D</m> can be absorbed into <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, as follows:
				</p>

				<me>
					y_p = (Ax^2 + Bx + C)(D e^{6x}) = \left(AD x^2 + BD x + CD\right) e^{6x}
				</me>.

				<p>
					So, relabeling <m>AD</m>, <m>BD</m>, and <m>CD</m> as <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, respectively, the form of <m>y_p</m> simplifies to:
				</p>

				<me>
					y_p = \left(A x^2 + B x + C\right) e^{6x}
				</me>.
			</solution>

		<p>
			As this example demonstrates, creating a product of forms directly from the table can lead to redundant coefficients. To build some confidence with this process, here are a few more examples to practice this skill.

	<subsection><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>

		<p>
			As discussed in the previous sections, the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, and the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>. This relationship is expressed as:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p
			</me>.
			However, it is possible for the particular solution to contain terms that overlap with those in the homogeneous solution. When this occurs, parts of the particular solution can be absorbed into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that does not accurately match the nonhomogeneous term on the right-hand side of the equation. This section highlights this issue and provides a strategy to resolve it.
		</p>

	<p>
        In the previous subsection, we determined how to select an appropriate form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, based on the structure of <m>f(x)</m>. However, before solving for the unknown coefficients in <m>y_p</m>, we must ensure that <m>y_p</m> is independent of the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The issue arises when a term in <m>y_p</m> is identical to a term in <m>y_h</m>. If this happens, substituting <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation would cause that term to be absorbed into the homogeneous solution, leaving us unable to fully account for the nonhomogeneous term <m>f(x)</m>. To prevent this, we apply an adjustment procedure known as the <em>modification rule</em>.
    </p>

	<blockquote>
        <p>
            <em>Modification Rule:</em>  
            If any term in <m>y_p</m> is also present in <m>y_h</m>, multiply that term in <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m>. If a term still appears in <m>y_h</m> after this adjustment, multiply by <m>x</m> again until all overlapping terms are removed.
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        This adjustment ensures that <m>y_p</m> introduces new, independent terms into the general solution, allowing it to account for <m>f(x)</m> without interference from the homogeneous solution.
    </p>

		<p>
			To illustrate this, consider the LNCC equation:
			<me>
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = e^{3x}
			</me>.
			Here, the homogeneous and particular solutions are:
			<me>
				y_h = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x}, \qquad y_p = A e^{3x}
			</me>.
			The problem arises when you observe that <m>Ae^{3x}</m> in <m>y_p</m> is similar to <m>c_2 e^{3x}</m> in <m>y_h</m>, causing the general solution to become:
			<me>
				y = y_h + y_p = c_1 e^{x} + c_2 e^{3x} + A e^{3x} = c_1 e^{x} + (c_2 + A) e^{3x}.
			</me>
			As a result, the particular solution effectively vanishes into the homogeneous solution, leading to a solution that fails to reflect the nonhomogeneous term <m>e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To address this, we adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by multiplying it by <m>x</m> until there are no overlapping terms between <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m>. In this example, multiplying <m>y_p</m> by <m>x</m> once is sufficient to make it independent of <m>y_h</m>. The adjusted form of <m>y_p</m> is:
			<me>
				y_p = A x e^{3x}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<theorem><title> Adjusting Particular Solutions </title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					When the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, contains terms in common with the homogeneous solution, <m>y_h</m>, adjust the form of <m>y_p</m> by repeatedly multiplying the overlapping terms by <m>x</m> until <m>y_h</m> and <m>y_p</m> share no terms in common.
				</p>
			</statement>

        To summarize, Let's go through a step-by-step breakdown of how to identify and adjust <m>y_p</m>:

        <li>
            <p>If a term in <m>y_p</m> appears in <m>y_h</m>, apply the <em>modification rule</em> by multiplying that term by <m>x</m> until it no longer overlaps.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Once adjustments are made, proceed to solving for the coefficients in <m>y_p</m>.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        This process guarantees that <m>y_p</m> remains independent from <m>y_h</m>, allowing us to construct a valid general solution.
    </p>


        <p>
            Ensuring that <m>y_p</m> is independent of <m>y_h</m> is a crucial step in the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em>. Now that we understand how to modify <m>y_p</m> when necessary, we can move on to determining the unknown coefficients by substituting <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation and solving for them.

	<subsection><title> Method Steps </title>

		<p>
			When solving a non-homogeneous linear differential equation, selecting the correct form for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, is just the beginning. The next step is determining the values of its unknown coefficients, such as <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. In this section, we'll explore how to compute these coefficients by substituting the guessed particular solution into the original equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's revisit the example we discussed earlier. Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="finding-yps-coefficients-de">
				y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
			</men>.
			We guessed that the particular solution would be linear, so we set
			<me>
				y_p = Ax + B
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our goal now is to determine the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>. To do this, we substitute <m>y_p = Ax + B</m> into the original differential equation. Here's how it works:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> y_p = Ax + B \quad \implies \quad y_p' = A \quad \implies \quad y_p'' = 0 </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Substituting <m>y_p</m>, <m>y_p'</m>, and <m>y_p''</m> into <xref ref="finding-yps-coefficients-de"/> results in:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> 0 - 4A + 3(Ax + B) =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> -4A + 3Ax + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
			<mrow> 3Ax -4A + 3B =\amp\ 9x </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Next, we match the <m>x</m> coefficients and the constants on opposite sides of the equation,
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 3A	  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ -4A + 3B}}} =\amp\ 
				{\color{BurntOrange}	\os{\Large\text{🏵️}}{\boxed{ 9		  }}}\ x + 
				{\color{RoyalBlue}		\os{\Large\text{💎}}{\boxed{ 0		 }}}
			</mrow>
		</md>.	

		<p>
			This gives us two equations to solve for <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
		</p>
		
		<sidebyside widths="20% 35% 10% 15% 20%" valigns="top top middle top top">
			<p/>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>\text{🏵️}: \hspace{5.25em}	3A		\amp = 9</mrow>
					<mrow>\text{💎}: \qquad -4A + 3B	\amp = 0</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>
					\implies
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow>	A \amp = 3</mrow>
					<mrow>	B \amp = 4</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>
		
		<p>
			Thus, the particular solution is:
		</p>
		<me>
			y_p = 3x + 4
		</me>.

		<p>
			Regardless of <m>y_p</m>'s form, the process of finding the coefficients remains consistent:
			<ul marker="square">
				<li><p>Substitute the chosen <m>y_p</m> into the differential equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Collect and match coefficients of like-terms on both sides of the equation.</p></li>
				<li><p>Solve the resulting system to find <m>A, B, C, \ldots</m>.</p></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			This is why the method is called the "method of undetermined coefficients." and the complete process is summarized as follows.
