        In the previous chapter, we focused on solving <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations were solved using the <em>characteristic equation</em>, which led to solutions composed of exponential functions.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this chapter, we generalize to a broader class of equations called <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which take the form:
    </p>
    
    <me>
        a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
    </me>
    
    <p>
        The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em> or <em>nonhomogeneous term</em>. This function represents an external influence, such as an applied force in physics, an input signal in electrical circuits, or an external source in population models. Because of this additional term, solutions to LNCC equations must account for both the behavior of the homogeneous part and the effect of <m>f(x)</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The general solution to an LNCC equation consists of two parts:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            The <em>homogeneous solution</em> <m>y_h</m>, which is found using the characteristic equation as in the previous chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
            The <em>particular solution</em> <m>y_p</m>, which accounts for the effects of <m>f(x)</m> and does not contain arbitrary constants.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Thus, the general solution takes the form:
    </p>
    
    <me>
        y = y_h + y_p
    </me>

    <p>
        Two powerful methods exist for determining <m>y_p</m>:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <em>Undetermined Coefficients</em>: A method that assumes a specific form for <m>y_p</m> based on the structure of <m>f(x)</m> and determines unknown coefficients algebraically.
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Laplace Transform Method</em>: A more systematic approach that transforms the differential equation into an algebraic equation in the Laplace domain.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        In this chapter, we begin with the <em>Undetermined Coefficients</em> method, which is efficient for solving LNCC equations where <m>f(x)</m> consists of polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions. We will explore how to construct the particular solution, how to adjust it when necessary, and how to apply the full method to solve differential equations step by step.
