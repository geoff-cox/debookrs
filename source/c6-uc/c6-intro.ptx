        In the previous chapter, we studied <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations had solutions composed of exponential functions, which we determined using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
    </p>

	<p>
        In this chapter, we generalize to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which have the form:
    </p>

	<men xml:id="lncc-intro-eqn">
		a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
	</men>.
	
	<p>
		The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em>. As we will see, the general solution to these nonhomogeneous equations consist of the sum of two parts: The <em>homogeneous</em> and the <em>particular solutions</em>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each part is defined by how their respective terms simplify when substituted into the left-hand side of the equation. In particular,
	</p>
	
	<ul marker="square">
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>homogeneous</em> terms simplify as like-terms to zero (i.e., cancel out), and
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				The <em>particular</em> terms simplify as like-terms to the function <m>f(x)</m>.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You are already familiar with the homogeneous solution from the previous chapter. The next step is to understand how solutions are composed. Specifically, we will investigate why the general solution must include both a homogeneous and a particular solution.
