        In the previous chapter, we studied <em>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) Differential Equations</em>, where the right-hand side of the equation was always zero. These equations had solutions composed of exponential functions, which we determined using the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
    </p>

	<p>
        In this chapter, we generalize to <em>Linear Nonhomogeneous Constant Coefficient (LNCC) Differential Equations</em>, which have the form:
    </p>

	<me>
		a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \dots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = f(x)
	</me>.
	
	<p>
		The key difference is the presence of a nonzero function <m>f(x)</m> on the right-hand side, known as the <em>forcing function</em>. Because of this additional term, solutions to LNCC equations must account for both the behavior of the homogeneous part and the effect of <m>f(x)</m>. An example of a homogeneous and nonhomogeneous version of the same differential equation is given by
	</p>

	<me>
		y'' - 4y' + 3y = 0, \qquad y'' - 4y' + 3y = 9x
	</me>.
	
	<p>
		The equation on the left is <em>homogeneous</em> because of the zero <xref ref="summary-terms" text="custom">constant term</xref> on the right. Solutions that satisfy this equation required exponential terms to cancel out. In contrast, the equation on the right is <em>nonhomogeneous</em> due to the <m>9x</m> term. Any solution we plug into this equation still contain the same exponential terms, but since they cancel out, an additional component is needed to end up with <m>9x</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, the general solution to these nonhomegeneous equations consist of two parts: <m>y = y_h + y_p</m>, where
	</p>
	
	<ul marker="square">
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>y_h</m> (<em>homogeneous part</em>) contains the <m>e^{rx}</m> terms that simplify to <m>0</m>, and
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>
				<m>y_p</m> (<em>particular part</em>) contains the terms that simplify to <m>f(x)</m>.
			</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

    <p>
        This reasoning leads to a general principle: in order for the particular solution, <m>y_p</m>, to satisfy the equation it must resemble the forcing function <m>f(x)</m>. In the upcoming sections, we will explore how to determine <m>y_p</m> and how it combines with the homogeneous solution <m>y_h</m> to form the complete general solution.
