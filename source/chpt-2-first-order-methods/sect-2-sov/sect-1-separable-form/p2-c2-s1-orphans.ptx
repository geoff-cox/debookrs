                Determine if the following DE is separable.
                <me> \frac{dz}{dt} = \cos^2 z </me>
            </p>
    
            <solution>
    
                <p>
                    This differential equation is first order. Since the derivative is already isolated, we need to determine if we can express the right-hand side as a product of functions where one function does not contain the dependent variable <m>z</m>, and the other does not contain the independent variable <m>t</m>. Consider the equivalent equation:
                    <me> \frac{dz}{dt} = \big( 1 \big) \cdot \big( \cos^2 z \big) </me>
                    It may seem trivial, but this satisfies the definition of separable. The first factor is a function that does not contain <m>z</m>, and the second factor is a function that does not contain <m>t</m>. The first factor is a constant function, which is perfectly acceptable. Therefore, this differential equation <em>is separable</em>.

                Even though no <m>x</m> terms are present, we still can group the terms like so:

                \frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 = (1)(y^2) = \underset{f(x)}{\left(\fbox{\(1\)}\right)}\underset{g(y)}{\left(\fbox{\(y^2\)}\right)}.

                \frac{dy}{dx} = x - 1 = (x - 1)(1) = \underset{f(x)}{\left(\fbox{\(x - 1\)}\right)}\underset{g(y)}{\left(\fbox{\(1\)}\right)}.

                \frac{dy}{dx} = 15 = (15)(1) = \underset{f(x)}{\left(\fbox{\(15\)}\right)}\underset{g(y)}{\left(\fbox{\(1\)}\right)}.
