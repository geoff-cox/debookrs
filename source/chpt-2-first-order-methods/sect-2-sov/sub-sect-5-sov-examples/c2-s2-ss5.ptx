        The following problems go beyond the basics and will require a little more algebra or more complex integration techniques to solve.

        <statement>
            <p>
                Solve the differential equation below using the separation of variables method. 
                <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{6x^2+1}{y^2} </me>
            </p>
        </statement>

        <hrule/>

        <solution>

            <p>
                This differential equation is first order. Next, we need to check that this differential equation is separable by converting it into the form <me>\quad \ds  \frac{dy}{dx} = \big( 6x^2+1 \big)\cdot \big( \frac{1}{y^2} \big).</me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Next, we will use algebra to move all the <m>y</m> terms to the left and all the <m>x</m> terms to the right.
                <me>y^2\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^2+1.</me>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so
                <me> \int y^2\frac{dy}{dx}dx = \int 6x^2+1\ dx </me>
                <me> \int y^2dy = \int 6x^2+1\ dx.</me>
            </p>
    
            <remark>
                Note: We get <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} dx = dy</m> from calculus, where <m>dy</m> is called the differential of <m>y</m>. We are not actually cancelling the <m>dx</m> terms.
            </remark>
    
            
            <p>
                Second, we note that when we have an indefinite integral, we find a family of solutions, and therefore we usually add a "<m>+ C</m>" to annotate the family of solutions. In this case, we will have a family of solutions on the left hand side of the equation and a separate family of solutions on the right hand side of the equation. However, we would not want to assume that it's the same `<m>+ C</m>" on both sides of the equation, so we will annotate one by <m>C_1</m> and the other by <m>C_2.</m>
            </p>
           
    
            <p xml:id='combining_constants_00'>
                <p>
                    Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. This gives:
                    <md>
                        <mrow xml:id="eqn_w_two_constants_00"> \frac{y^3}{3} + C_1	\amp= 2x^3 + x + C_2	</mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    This might feel done, but we should step back and think about what our goal is. Remember, we are looking for an unknown function that satisfies the DE. In this case, our unknown function is <m>y</m>, so we should solve for <m>y</m>. Let's carefully isolate <m>y</m> step by step. We begin by grouping the constants together
                    <me> \frac{y^3}{3} = 2x^3 + x + (C_2 - C_1)</me>
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Since <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are both constants, it stands to reason that <m>C_2 - C_1</m> is a constant as well. Therefore, we can collapse this difference down to one constant, <m>C_3</m>:
                    <fn>
                        In further examples of this section, we will omit this step of combining multiple constants and just write <m>C</m>.
                    </fn>
                    <men xml:id="eqn_w_one_constant_00">
                        \frac{y^3}{3} = 2x^3 + x + C_3
                    </men>
                </p>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (?) with the equivalent equation (?)we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called <m>C</m>. We could repeat this process every time we use the separation of variable solution technique. We'll always end up integrating both sides of the equation, we'll always end up grouping the constants together on one side of the equation, and we'll always re-name the difference of constants to name it a single constant. Since we end up repeating those same steps, we will typically omit the steps where we write down constants on both sides of the equation, then combine them to form a new one. In the next example, you'll see that we cut to the chase and write the result of just having one constant on one side of the equation.
            </p>
           
            <p>
                Next, we want to solve for y.
                <md>
                    <mrow>    3\frac{y^3}{3} = 3(2x^3 + x + C_3)			          \amp \text{ multiply by }3</mrow>
                    <mrow>   y^3 = 6x^3 + 3x + 3C_3	        \amp \text{ distribute the } 3 \text{ on the right hand side}</mrow>
                    <mrow>     \sqrt[3]{ y^3} = \sqrt[3]{6x^3 + 3x + 3C_3}         \amp \text{ take the cube root of both sides}</mrow>
                    <mrow>        y  \amp = \sqrt[3]{6x^3 + 3x + 3C_3} \amp \text{ simplify the left hand side } </mrow>
                </md>
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Since <m>C_3</m> is a constant, it should be clear that  <m>3C_3</m>  is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, <m>C_4</m>. In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant <m>C</m>:
                <me>     y  \amp = \sqrt[3]{6x^3 + 3x + C_4}.</me>
            </p>

        </solution>
    
    </example>

    <p>
        Let's try another example, and then we can step back and see if we can generalize this method of solution.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="ex_solve_sov_02">

        <statement>
            <p>
                Solve the initial value problem
                <me>z' - 1 = z^2, \quad z(4) = 9</me>
            </p>
        </statement>
        
        <solution>
        <p>
            Clearly, this DE is first order, but is it separable? In order to determine this, we isolate the derivative on the left hand side of the equation.
            <me>z' = z^2 + 1</me>
            We can immediately see that this is separable with the following grouping:
            <me>z' = \big( 1 \big)\big(z^2 + 1\big).</me>
            Have you noticed that we don't even know what the independent variable is?  There's no information provided that lets us know.
            <fn>
                If you run across a situation like this in the context of a real-world scenario, you might think about the meaning of the variables. Is the quantity changing with respect to time? If so, then <m>t</m> might be an appropriate independent variable. If the quantity changes spatially, then you might consider using <m>x</m> for the independent variable since we often use that variable to represent a distance along an <m>x</m>-axis. We don't have any context here, so we can choose any variable we like (except <m>z</m>, of course!).
            </fn>
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll proceed by assuming that the independent variable is <m>t</m>. Then we can write the derivative as <m>dz/dt</m>, and then completely separate as follows.
            <md>
                <mrow> 					z'	\amp= \big( 1 \big) \big(z^2 + 1\big)	</mrow>
                <mrow> 		\frac{dz}{dt}	\amp= \big( 1 \big) \big(z^2 + 1\big)	</mrow>
                <mrow> \frac{1}{z^2+1}dz	\amp= 1dt									</mrow>
            </md>
            With the variables completely separated, we can now integrate both sides of the equation.
            <md>
                <mrow> \int\frac{1}{z^2+1}\ dz	\amp= \int 1\ dt									</mrow>
                <mrow> \arctan z + C_1 \amp= t + C_2	</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            We're almost done. Our last job is to combine constants and solve for the unknown function (i.e., the dependent variable <m>z</m>).

            <md>
                <mrow> 				\arctan z	\amp= t + C_3		</mrow>
                <mrow> \tan \Big(\arctan z\Big)	\amp= \tan(t+C_3)	</mrow>
                <mrow> 						z	\amp= \tan(t+C_3)						</mrow>
            </md>

            Hence, the DE <m>z' -1 = z^2</m> has solution
            <me>z = \tan(t+C),</me>
            where <m>C</m> is any constant.
            <fn>
                Some students are tempted to further rewrite the final answer as
                <me> z = \tan(t+C) = \tan t + \tan C </me>
                or even
                <me> z = \tan(t+C) = \tan t + C. </me>
                However, neither of these are correct.

    <example xml:id="example-sov-examples-02"><title> Verify our solution </title>

        <p>
            As in the previous example, we don't have to check our answer, but one of the best parts about DEs is that we always can check, which means we can really know if we have the right solution. Let's check this one. We will substitute our solution back into the DE and verify that when we do, we get the same thing on both sides of the equation.

                <mrow> RHS	\amp= z^2</mrow>

                <mrow> \amp= \tan^2(t+C)</mrow>
            </md>

        </p>

        <p>
            At first glance, it looks like we have different expressions on the left and right hand sides of the equation. However, if we recall the trigonometric identity

                <me>\tan^2 x = \sec^2 x - 1,</me>

            then we can see that these expressions are, in fact equivalent. Thus, we have verified that <m>z = \tan(t+C)</m>, where <m>C</m> is any constant, is a solution to the DE <m>z' -1 = z^2</m>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we've practiced this solution technique a couple of times, let's summarize.
        </p>

    </example>

	<p>
        The final piece to this method involves isolating the solution, if possible, and applying any initial conditions that are given with the differential equation. We say "if possible" because sometimes, after integrating both sides of the equation, you get an expression that is impossible to solve for <m>y</m> as an explicit function of <m>x</m>. Let's take a look at an example of a situation where you can solve for <m>y</m> and one where you cannot.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="sov-example-level-3-01">
        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Solve the differential equation below using the separation of variables method. 
                <me> x\frac{dy}{dx} + 10x^2y = 6x^2 </me>
            </p>
        </statement>

        <hrule/>

        <solution>

        <p>
            Recall, we already showed this differential equation is separable in EXAMPLE REF, converting it into the form <me>\quad \ds  \frac{dy}{dx} = \big( 2x \big)\cdot \big( 3 - 5y \big).</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we will use algebra to move all the <m>y</m> terms to the left and all the <m>x</m> terms to the right.
            <me>\frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so
            <me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx}dx = \int 2x\ dx </me>
            <me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}dy = \int 2x\ dx.</me>
        </p>


        <p xml:id='integration'>
            <p>
                Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. Using the substitution <m>u = 3-5y</m>, we can integrate the left-hand side as <m>-\frac15\ln|3-5y|+C_1</m>. This gives:
                <md>
                    <mrow xml:id="eqn_after_integration"> -\frac{1}{5}\ln|3 - 5y|	+C_1 \amp= x^2 + C_2	</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (?) with the equivalent equation (?) we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called <m>C</m>. We could repeat this process every time we use the separation of variable solution technique. We'll always end up integrating both sides of the equation, we'll always end up grouping the constants together on one side of the equation, and we'll always re-name the difference of constants to name it a single constant.

In the next example, you'll see that we cut to the chase and write the result of just having one constant on one side of the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, multiply both sides of the equation by <m>-5</m> and then exponentiate both sides to undo the logarithm.
            <md>
                <mrow>     \ln|3 - 5y|  \amp = -5x^2 - 5C_3	          \amp \text{multiply by }-5</mrow>

            </md>

        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we need to get the <m>y</m> outside of the absolute value function. Dropping the absolute value signs on the left hand side requires adding "<m>\pm</m>" to the right hand side:
            <me>3 - 5y = \pm e^{-5C_3} \cdot e^{-5x^2}</me>
            We are almost done. We can use algebra to solve for <m>y</m>, as follows.
            <md>
                <mrow> y	\amp= \left(\pm \frac{e^{-5C_3}}{5}\right) \cdot e^{-5x^2} + \frac{3}{5}</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since <m>C_3</m> is a constant, it should be clear that the whole expression inside the parentheses is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, <m>C_4</m>. In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant <m>C</m>:
            <me>y = Ce^{-5x^2}+\frac35,\quad (C \neq 0).</me>

            It's always worth it when you first start solving DEs to step back and make sure you identify independent and dependent variables. Here <m>z</m> is dependent and <m>y</m> is independent. That means when we're done we hope to have a function
            <me>
            z = \underbrace{\hspace{4.0cm}}_{\text{some function of } y}
            </me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, even though the terminology we use is <em>initial</em> condition, we typically won't use that piece of information until the very end.

            First let's verify that the DE is first order (it is!), and then we go about solving for the derivative.
            <md>
                <mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} - yz	\amp= y</mrow>
                <mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} 	\amp= y + yz</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we have solved for the derivative, is it possible write the right hand side of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m> and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>y</m>?  That is, we'd like to write the DE in the form suggested below.
            <me>
                \frac{dz}{dy} = \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no z's}} \Big) \cdot
                \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no x's}} \Big)
            </me>
            Hopefully you can see that there is a way, by factoring <m>y</m> out of each term on the right hand side, as below.
            <me>\frac{dz}{dy} = y(1 + z)</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we need to completely separate variables.
            <me>\frac{1}{1+z}dz = ydy</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step will be to integrate both sides of the equation. (If the integral on the right hand side is at all questionable to you, you should do take an extra step and actually do the substitution <m>u = 1+z.</m>)
            <md>
                <mrow> \int \frac{1}{1+z}dz	\amp= \int ydy</mrow>
                <mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            As before, we write only one constant of integration (recall that we're skipping a couple of steps here; details provided in Example 6).
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that our goal is to solve for the unknown function <m>z</m>. Since it's currently inside of a logarithm, we exponentiate both sides of the equation.
            <md>
                <mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
                <mrow> e^{\ln|1+z|}	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2 + C}</mrow>
                <mrow> |1+z|	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}\cdot e^C</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            We continue solving for <m>z</m>.
            <md>
                <mrow> 1+z	\amp= \underbrace{\pm e^C}_{\text{rename } A} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}</mrow>
                <mrow> 1+z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}		</mrow>
                <mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1	</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we can use that initial condition, <m>z(0) = 5</m>, to solve for <m>A</m>. The initial condition can be read,
            "when <m>y</m> is zero, <m>z</m> is 5."  We substitute into our solution accordingly.
            <md>
                <mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0^2} - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^0 - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 6	\amp= A\cdot 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 6	\amp= A</mrow>

            Therefore, the solution to the IVP is
