		The first method we will discuss is known as <em>separation of variables</em>. This approach is based on the idea that a differential equation can be written in a way that allows its variables to be separated on opposite sides of the equation. This separation enables us to independently integrate both sides of the equation, thus arriving at the solution. Differential equations with this property are referred to as <em>separable</em>.

		We will start by explaining the concept of separability and the process of expressing it in <em>separable form</em>. After that, we will introduce the separation of variables method and explore some examples.
