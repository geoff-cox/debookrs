		There is no one, single solution technique that will solve all differential equations. Every new technique that we explore in this text will always start by grouping a set of differential equations that share one or more properties in common. The first solution technique considers only differential equations that are both first-order and separable. You have seen an example of <xref ref="example-order-1" text="custom">first-order DE</xref>, but is it separable?  We have not mentioned separable yet and so this is where we need to begin.

			The general solution to the first-order separable differential equation,
			<men xml:id="sov-method-de">
				\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y),
			</men>
			can be determined through the following steps...

		<dl width="narrow">
			<li xml:id="sov-step-1"><title>Step 1: Verify Method </title>
				<p>
					Show the DE has order 1 and is <xref ref="sov-method-de" text="custom"> separable </xref>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li xml:id="sov-step-2"><title>Step 2: Separate &amp; Integrate </title>
				<p>
					From <xref ref="sov-method-de"/>, move the <m>y</m> terms to the left. Then integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>.
					<me>
						\DS \int \frac{1}{g(y)} \underset{=\ dy}{\underbrace{\frac{dy}{dx}dx}} = \int f(x) dx
					</me>

			<li xml:id="sov-step-3"><title>Step 3: Finalize Solution </title>
				<p>
					Write down the general solution and apply initial conditions.
