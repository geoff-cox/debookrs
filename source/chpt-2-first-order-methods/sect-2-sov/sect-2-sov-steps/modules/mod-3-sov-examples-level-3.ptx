    <p>
        The final piece to this method involves isolating the solution, if possible, and applying any initial conditions that are given with the differential equation. We say "if possible" because sometimes, after integrating both sides of the equation, you get an expression that is impossible to solve for <m>y</m> as an explicit function of <m>x</m>. Let's take a look at an example of a situation where you can solve for <m>y</m> and one where you cannot.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="sov-example-level-3-01">
        
        <statement>
            <p>
                Solve the differential equation below using the separation of variables method. 
                <me> x\frac{dy}{dx} + 10x^2y = 6x^2 </me>
            </p>
        </statement>

        <hrule/>

        <solution>

        <p>
            Recall, we already showed this differential equation is separable in EXAMPLE REF, converting it into the form <me>\quad \DS  \frac{dy}{dx} = \big( 2x \big)\cdot \big( 3 - 5y \big).</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, we will use algebra to move all the <m>y</m> terms to the left and all the <m>x</m> terms to the right.
            <me>\frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so
            <me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx}dx = \int 2x\ dx </me>
            <me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}dy = \int 2x\ dx.</me>
        </p>


        <p xml:id='integration'>
            <p>
                Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. Using the substitution <m>u = 3-5y</m>, we can integrate the left-hand side as <m>-\frac15\ln|3-5y|+C_1</m>. This gives:
                <md>
                    <mrow xml:id="eqn_after_integration"> -\frac{1}{5}\ln|3 - 5y|	+C_1 \amp= x^2 + C_2	</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (?) with the equivalent equation (?) we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called <m>C</m>. We could repeat this process every time we use the separation of variable solution technique. We'll always end up integrating both sides of the equation, we'll always end up grouping the constants together on one side of the equation, and we'll always re-name the difference of constants to name it a single constant. Since we end up repeating those same steps, we will typically omit the steps where we write down constants on both sides of the equation, then combine them to form a new one. In the next example, you'll see that we cut to the chase and write the result of just having one constant on one side of the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Next, multiply both sides of the equation by <m>-5</m> and then exponentiate both sides to undo the logarithm.
            <md>
                <mrow>     \ln|3 - 5y|  \amp = -5x^2 - 5C_3	          \amp \text{multiply by }-5</mrow>
                <mrow>  e^{\ln|3 - 5y|} \amp = e^{-5x^2 - 5C_3}         \amp \text{exponentiate both sides}</mrow>
                <mrow>        |3 - 5y|  \amp = e^{-5x^2 - 5C_3}         \amp <xref text="custom" ref="ln_rule_02">property of <m>\ln</m></xref></mrow>
                <mrow>        |3 - 5y|  \amp = e^{-5x^2}\cdot e^{-5C_3} \amp <xref text="custom" ref="exp_rule_02e">property of <m>e</m></xref></mrow>
            </md>

        </p>

        <p>
            Now, we need to get the <m>y</m> outside of the absolute value function. Dropping the absolute value signs on the left hand side requires adding "<m>\pm</m>" to the right hand side:
            <me>3 - 5y = \pm e^{-5C_3} \cdot e^{-5x^2}</me>
            We are almost done. We can use algebra to solve for <m>y</m>, as follows.
            <md>
                <mrow> y	\amp= \left(\pm \frac{e^{-5C_3}}{5}\right) \cdot e^{-5x^2} + \frac{3}{5}</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Since <m>C_3</m> is a constant, it should be clear that the whole expression inside the parentheses is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, <m>C_4</m>. In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant <m>C</m>:
            <me>y = Ce^{-5x^2}+\frac35,\quad (C \neq 0).</me>
        </p>

        </solution>
    
    </example>

    <example xml:id="ex_sov_03"><title> Applying separation of variables </title>

        <p>
            Solve the following initial value problem.
            <me>\frac{dz}{dy} - yz = y, \hspace{1cm} z(0) = 5</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            It's always worth it when you first start solving DEs to step back and make sure you identify independent and dependent variables. Here <m>z</m> is dependent and <m>y</m> is independent. That means when we're done we hope to have a function
            <me>
            z = \underbrace{\hspace{4.0cm}}_{\text{some function of } y}
            </me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, even though the terminology we use is <em>initial</em> condition, we typically won't use that piece of information until the very end.

            </aside>
        </p>

        <p>
            First let's verify that the DE is first order (it is!), and then we go about solving for the derivative.
            <md>
                <mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} - yz	\amp= y</mrow>
                <mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} 	\amp= y + yz</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that we have solved for the derivative, is it possible write the right hand side of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m> and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>y</m>?  That is, we'd like to write the DE in the form suggested below.
            <me>
                \frac{dz}{dy} = \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no z's}} \Big) \cdot
                \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no x's}} \Big)
            </me>
            Hopefully you can see that there is a way, by factoring <m>y</m> out of each term on the right hand side, as below.
            <me>\frac{dz}{dy} = y(1 + z)</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we need to completely separate variables.
            <me>\frac{1}{1+z}dz = ydy</me>
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step will be to integrate both sides of the equation. (If the integral on the right hand side is at all questionable to you, you should do take an extra step and actually do the substitution <m>u = 1+z.</m>)
            <md>
                <mrow> \int \frac{1}{1+z}dz	\amp= \int ydy</mrow>
                <mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            As before, we write only one constant of integration (recall that we're skipping a couple of steps here; details provided in Example 6).
        </p>

        <p>
            Remember that our goal is to solve for the unknown function <m>z</m>. Since it's currently inside of a logarithm, we exponentiate both sides of the equation.
            <md>
                <mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
                <mrow> e^{\ln|1+z|}	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2 + C}</mrow>
                <mrow> |1+z|	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}\cdot e^C</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            We continue solving for <m>z</m>.
            <md>
                <mrow> 1+z	\amp= \underbrace{\pm e^C}_{\text{rename } A} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}</mrow>
                <mrow> 1+z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}		</mrow>
                <mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1	</mrow>
            </md>
        </p>

        <p>
            Now we can use that initial condition, <m>z(0) = 5</m>, to solve for <m>A</m>. The initial condition can be read,
            "when <m>y</m> is zero, <m>z</m> is 5."  We substitute into our solution accordingly.
            <md>
                <mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0^2} - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^0 - 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 6	\amp= A\cdot 1</mrow>
                <mrow> 6	\amp= A</mrow>
            </md>
            <aside>
                <p>
                    * mention that we can't call <m>A = 6</m> our solution!

            </aside>
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, the solution to the IVP is
            <me>z = 6e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1.</me>
