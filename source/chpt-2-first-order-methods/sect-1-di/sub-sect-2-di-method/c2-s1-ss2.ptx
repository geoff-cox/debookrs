		<statement>

				Solve the differential equation

				First note that our differential equation is equivalen  Recall that solving a differential equation involves isolating <m>y</m>. In this context, you can think of <m>y</m> as being "trapped" inside the derivative <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. Calculus allows us to "remove" <m>y</m> from the derivative via integration. So, let's integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to get
				<md>
					<mrow> \int\frac{dy}{dx}\ dx \amp = \int x^2\ dx</mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\overset{<xref ref="integral-of-dy"/>}{\hookrightarrow}\qquad 
						y + C_1    \amp = \frac13 x^3 + C_2
					</mrow>.
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, we isolate <m>y</m> and combine constants.
				<md>
				<mrow>  y \amp = \frac13 x^3 + C_2 - C_1 </mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since <m> C_2 - C_1 </m> is still a constant, we combine it into a single constant, <m>C</m>, and write our solution as
				<me>
				y = \frac13 x^3 + C
				</me>
			</p>

		</solution>

	<p>
		This example may seem like overkill for such a simple problem, but it illustrates the basic idea of solving a differential equation that we will use throughout this text. The process always involves isolating the dependent variable, in this case <m>y</m>, on one side of the equation and writing it as a function of the independent variable, <m>x</m>, and possibly some constants.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Solve the differential equation
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big] = \cos x </me>

		<solution>
			
			<p>
				To solve the differential equation 
				<me>\frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big] = \cos x</me>, 
				we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to get
				<md>
					<mrow> \int \frac{d}{dx}\Big[y\sin(2x)\Big]dx \amp = \int \cos x\ dx</mrow>
					<mrow> y\sin(2x) + C_1 \amp = \sin x + C_2 </mrow>

				Finally, we isolate <m>y</m> and combine constants.
