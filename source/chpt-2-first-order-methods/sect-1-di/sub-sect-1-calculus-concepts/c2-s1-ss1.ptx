		The simplest type of differential equation to solve is one that you encountered many times in your calculus class whenever you were asked to find an anti-derivative of a function. For example, suppose you wanted the anti-derivative of <m>x^2</m>. If you remember from calculus, this is the same as asking: "What function, when differentiated, gives you <m>x^2</m>?" or
		<me>\frac{d}{dx}\Big[\quad ? \quad \Big] = x^2</me>,
		but this is just the differential equation
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = x^2</me>
		where you must solve for <m>y</m>.
	</p>
		
	<p>
		Even though we already know that the anti-derivative of <m>x^2</m> is <m>\displaystyle \frac13 x^3 + C</m>, we will walk through how it would be solved as a differential equation. To prepare, review the following concepts from calculus.

	<lemma>
		<statement>
			<p>
				All of the expressions below are equivalent ways to represent the derivative of a function <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>. 
				<me> \frac{d}{dx}[y] = \frac{dy}{dx} = y^\prime </me>
			</p>
		</statement>
	</lemma>

	<lemma>
		<statement>
			<p>
				The indefinite integral (i.e. anti-derivative) of the derivative of a function is the function itself, up to a constant. That is, 
				<men xml:id="integral-of-dy">\displaystyle\int\frac{dy}{dx}\ dx = y + C</men>,
				or
				<men xml:id="integral-of-df">\displaystyle\int\frac{d}{dx}\left[f(x)\right]\ dx = f(x) + C</men>.
