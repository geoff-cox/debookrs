                One of the steps of the integrating factor technique involves integrating both sides of a differential equation. To get us started, consider the following example. 
            </p>
            
        </introduction>
    
        <example xml:id="exp-1">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find <m>y</m> if
                    <me>
                        y^\prime = x^5.
                    </me>
                </p>
            </statement>
    
            <solution>
                <p>
                    To find <m>y</m>, let's integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \int y^\prime(x) \ dx \amp = \int x^5 \ dx</mrow>
                        <mrow>  y(x) \amp = \frac16x^6 + C </mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <p>
            This example illustrates that when a derivative is isolated on one side of an equation, you can often integrate both sides of the equation to remove the derivative. In general, if
            <md>
                <mrow> y^\prime \amp = f(x) </mrow>
            </md>
            then <m>y</m> can be found by integrating both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>,
            <md>
                <mrow> \int y^\prime(x) \ dx \amp = \int f(x) \ dx </mrow>
                <mrow> y \amp = \int f(x) \ dx = F(x) + C</mrow>
            </md>
            where <m>F(x) + C</m> the most general anti-derivative of <m>f(x)</m>.
            <fn> This is only possible if <m>f(x)</m> is continuous on its domain (i.e. <m>x</m>-values we are considering). </fn>
        </p>
    
        <example xml:id="exp-2">
            <statement>
                <p>
                    Find <m>y</m> if
                    <me>
                        \frac{d}{dx}\left[5x \cdot y\right] = \cos x.
                    </me>
                </p>
            </statement>
    
            <solution>
                <p>
                    In this example, there are multiple terms inside the derivative, but the derivative is still isolated on one side of the equation, so we integrate both sides as before.
                    <md>
                        <mrow> \int \frac{d}{dx}\left[5x \cdot y\right] \ dx \amp = \int \cos x \ dx</mrow>
                        <mrow>  5x \cdot y \amp = \sin x + C </mrow>
                        <mrow>  y \amp = \frac{\sin x + C}{5x} </mrow>
                    </md>
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <p>
            Both of these examples show how to solve a DE in the special form where the derivative is isolated on one side of a equation and a function of only <m>x</m> on the other. This idea important because it represents the motivation behind the integrating factor technique. If you are curious, here is a sneak-peek of what applying the integrating factor (IF) method will look like.
            <md>
                <mrow> \text{Start with this DE} \rightarrow \quad \frac{dy}{dx} - 2y \amp = 5 </mrow>
                <mrow> \amp \downarrow \text{Apply IF Method} </mrow>
                <mrow> \text{New DE} \rightarrow \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[ y \cdot e^{-2x} \right] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} \quad \leftarrow \text{Easy to solve.}</mrow>
            </md>
    
            Don't be concerned about where the ``New DE" came from, we will talk about it in the next section. For now, just know that if the differential equation can be written in the ``New DE" form, then you can finish the problem by finding <m>y</m> as we did in the previous example.
