        We know that <m>\ds \frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot \mu\right]</m> can be written as 
        <me>\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot \mu + y \cdot \frac{d\mu}{dx}.</me>
        So we must match these terms with the terms in <xref ref="example-if-product-rule-reverse-02-eq"/>. Writing out these terms side-by-side helps determine the matching, as shown here

    <p>
        From the figure we see that <m>\mu = e^{5x^2}</m> since it is the term next to <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. Moreover, a quick check also shows that <m>\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 10xe^{5x^2},</m> completing the matching.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this chapter, we will study a solution technique that will help us solve differential equations that are first order and linear. Consider this (carefully selected) example.
        <men xml:id="original_de">
            x^7 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 7x^{6}\cdot y = e^x
        </men>
        Notice that the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and the independent variable is <m>x</m>, so we seek to find a formula for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>. The DE is also first order and linear.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        What makes this DE special is that the left hand side can be rewritten as follows.
        <men xml:id="rewritten_de">
            \frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big) = e^x
        </men>
        We can verify this by actually using the product rule to take the derivative on the left hand side:
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp=  \frac{d}{dx}\Big(\underbrace{x^7}_{f(x)} \cdot \underbrace{y}_{g(x)} \Big)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp= f(x) \cdot g'(x) + f'(x) \cdot g(x)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp= x^7 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 7x^{6}\cdot y</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        Now that we have confirmed that Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/> is equivalent to Equation <xref ref="original_de"/>, we can proceed in solving the DE. 
    </p>
            
    <p>
        The unknown function we want to solve for is <m>y</m>, and it is part of the product we are taking the derivative of in Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/>. So we begin by undoing that differentiation by integrating both sides of Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/> with respect to <m>x</m>:
        
        <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big) dx \amp= \int e^x dx</mrow>
            <mrow xml:id="almost_done">x^7 \cdot y      \amp= e^x + C</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        We can now just divide both sides of <xref ref="almost_done" text="custom">Equation</xref> by the coefficient on <m>y</m> to obtain the general solution.
        <me>y = \frac{e^x}{x^7} + \frac{C}{x^7}</me>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        Recall that we said this was a carefully selected DE. This very special DE had the property that we could undo the product rule on its left hand side. This is not, in general, the case when we encounter a first order linear DE. For example, consider this DE.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        (use one of the first examples we do in the book??)
    </p>
            
    <p>
        We cannot immediately undo the product rule here, but there is some hope. We do see the unknown function <m>y</m> and its derivative, so we have some of the stuff we need to undo the product rule. What weâ€™ll see in this chapter is that we can manipulate the DE so that we will be able to undo the product rule and proceed to solve as we did in the example above, and so we begin this chapter by focusing on the details around making that possible.
    </p>


    <p>
        The integration factor technique relies heavily on our understanding of the product rule for differentiation, so let's quickly recall what this looks like and go over some examples.

        DO WE WANT A SUMMARY?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Let's summarize the procedure we have been working on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <term> Solving First Order Linear DEs with an Integrating Factor </term>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Verify that the DE is first order and linear.  (Don't overlook this step!!  Nothing that follows here makes any sense if the DE isn't both first order and linear.)	
            </li>

            <li>  
                Rearrange the DE to put it in standard form for this solution technique.
                <me>\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x)</me>
                In standard form, the dependent variable and the derivative are on the left hand side	of the equation and the coefficient on the derivative is 1.
                (Here we assume that <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable;	this will look different if your DE has different independent and dependent variables).	
            </li>

            <li>  
                Identify the function <m>P(x)</m> and then find the integrating factor <m>z = e^{\int P(x) dx}.</m> (Note that we integrate with respect to the independent variable. We also need only one integrating factor, so we typically omit the <m>+C</m> that is ordinarily associated with	an indefinite integral.)
            </li>
            
            <li> Multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.	</li>
            
            <li> 
                Rewrite the left hand side of the DE by "un-doing" the product rule. This is the crucial step where you should check to make sure that you really can un-do the product rule. If you can't then check to make sure you correctly  determined determined the integrating factor.	
            </li>
            
            <li>  
                Integrate both sides of the equation (with respect to the independent variable). (Here you should have a constant of integration.)	
            </li>

            <li>  Solve for the dependent variable to get the general solution.	</li>
            
            <li>  If an initial condition is provided, apply it last to determine the value of the constant of integration.	</li>

        </ul>
    </p>

    
  
	<p>
	  The idea in the previous examples will be at the center of helping us solve the DEs of this chapter, but we need to expand on this a bit to fully prepare you for the discussion in the next section. Let's now dive into the following examples to see what we mean.
	</p>

	

	<paragraphs>
		<title>Taken From Integrating Factor</title>
		
		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ y \cdot e^{-2x} \right] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} \quad \leftarrow \text{Easy to solve!} </mrow>
			</md>
			and then we integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m> to free the unknown <m>y</m> from inside the <m>\frac{d}{dx}</m>, so that we can solve for it. However, we have not talked about how the integrating factor gets the differential equation into this form. Luckily, the product rule for deriviatives holds the answer. Therefore, let's start this discussing by reminding ourselves that the product rule is given by
			<me> \frac{d}{dx}[\ f \cdot g\ ] = \frac{d}{dx}[\ f\ ] \cdot g + f \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\ g\ ]. </me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			Ok, the claim is that after a some math the differential equation
			<men xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq1"> \frac{dy}{dx} - 2y = 5 </men>
			can be rewritten as 
			<men xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq2"> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ y \cdot e^{-2x} \right] = 5 e^{-2x}. </men>
			To explain this, it may be easier to work backwards. That is, let's start with <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq2" /> and see how it may connect back to <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" />. We start by applying the product rule on the left side,
			<mdn>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[\ y \cdot e^{-2x}\ ] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}[\ y\ ] \cdot e^{-2x} + y \cdot \frac{d}{dx}[\ e^{-2x}\ ] \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow> \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{-2x} + y \cdot \left(-2 e^{-2x}\right) \amp = 5 e^{-2x} </mrow>
				<mrow xml:id="if_prod_rule_eq3"> \frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{-2x} - 2 y \cdot e^{-2x} \amp = 5 e^{-2x}. </mrow>
			</mdn>
			At this point stop and compare equation <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" /> with the last equation <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq3" />. Do you see how the two equations are connected?
		</p>
	
		<p>
			You should see that multiplying both sides of <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq1" /> by <m>e^{-2x}</m> gives you <xref ref="if_prod_rule_eq3" />.
	
		</p>
	
		<p>
			In a nutshell, the integrating factor technique attempts to solve
			<me>y' + P(x)y = Q(x)</me>
			by multiplying both sides by an unknown function, <m>\mu</m>
			<me>\mu y' + \mu P(x)y = \mu Q(x)</me>
			then find a <m>\mu</m> so that the left-hand side can be written as the product rule of <m>\mu</m> and <m>y</m>.
			<me>\us{\large \text{product rule}}{\ub{\mu y' + \mu P(x)y}} = \mu Q(x)</me>
		</p>
	
		<p>
			To clarify, let's look at an example where we know <m>\mu</m>.
		</p>
	
		
		  
		<p>
			The previous example shows how to solve the equation when you know what <m>\mu</m> is. However, in a real problem, you will have to find <m>\mu</m> first!
		</p>
		  
		<p>
			Let's build on the previous example to try and understand why <m>\mu = e^{6x}</m> worked. It is important to try and think of <m>\mu(x)</m> as the missing part needed to to be consistent with the product rule. That is, the left-side of the equation
		  
			<me>\us{\large \text{product rule}}{\us{\large \text{incomplete}}{\ub{y' + 6y}}} = 1</me>
		  
			is missing a second function needed to be consistent with the product rule. So let's fill-in this missing function by multiplying both sides by <m>\mu</m>,
		  
			<men xml:id="complete-product-rule-eqn">\mu y' + 6 \mu y = \mu.</men>
		  
			Is the left-side, <m>\mu y' + 6 \mu y</m>, equal to <m>\left[\mu y\right]'</m>? Well, not exactly, since taking this derivative shows the difference between these two, namely

		<p>
			However, what if <m>\mu</m> was chosen so that <m>\mu' = 6\mu</m>? It turns out that this is exactly how we chose <m>\mu</m>. Finding <m>\mu</m> such that <m>\mu' = 6\mu</m> is itself a differential equation which can be solved using separation of variables. (You may try it yourself first for practice, then look below to see how to solve this DE.)
		</p>
		  
		<p>
			Using separation of variables, solve
			<md>
			  <mrow>\mu' \amp= 6\mu.</mrow>
			</md>
			to get the solution
			  <fn>

				  <mrow>\frac{d\mu}{dx} \amp= 6\mu</mrow>

				  <mrow>\mu \amp= A e^{6x}</mrow>
				</md>
			  </fn>
			<me>\mu = A e^{6x}.</me>
		  
			Since, we only need one <m>\mu</m> to work, we choose <m>A=1</m> for convenience, hence
		  
			<me>\mu = e^{6x}.</me>
		  
			Now you see where the <m>\mu</m> came from in part 1 of <xref ref="if-intro-exercise"/>.  In fact, this example outlines how <m>\mu</m> is found for any first order linear differential equation of the form 
			<men xml:id="EQ-1st-order-de-pre">y' + P(x)y = Q(x).</men>
