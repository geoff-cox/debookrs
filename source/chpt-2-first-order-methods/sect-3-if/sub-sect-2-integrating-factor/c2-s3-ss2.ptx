<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Reversing the Product Rule </title>

	<p>
		The concept of an integrating factor is introduced to facilitate the use of the <q>backward</q> product rule for certain differential equations. To illustrate this, consider the differential equation
		<men xml:id="integrating-factor-eqn"> 
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
		</men>.
		Our goal is to rewrite the left side as a single derivative in the form <m>\frac{d}{dx}\left[ f \cdot g \right]</m> using the <q>backward</q> product rule.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recall that we need to identify <m>f</m> and <m>g'</m> in the first term and <m>f'</m> and <m>g</m> in the second. However, since <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> stands alone in the first term, something is missing. Perhaps we can multiply both sides of the equation by a factor that enables the <q>backward</q> product rule. Let's explore a few possibilities.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, let's try multiplying by <m>x^2</m>. This transforms the equation to:
		<me> x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + 2x^2y = 5x^2 </me>.
		Labeling the terms on the left, we have:
		<me>
			\overset{\color{blue}{f}}{\displaystyle x^2 \vphantom{\big]'}} \cdot 
			\overset{\color{blue}{g'}}{\frac{dy}{dx} \vphantom{\big]'}} + 
			\overset{\color{blue}{f'}}{2x^2 \vphantom{\big]'}} \cdot 
			\overset{\color{blue}{g}}{y \vphantom{\big]'}}
		</me>.
		Although <m>g</m> and <m>g'</m> are consistent, <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> are not, since <m>[x^2]'=2x \ne 2x^2</m>. Thus, <m>x^2</m> is not the correct factor.
	</p>
	<p>
		Next, let's try multiplying by <m>e^{2x}</m>. This changes the equation to:
		<me> e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x}y = 5e^{2x} </me>.
		Now, the labels are consistent, as shown below:
		<me>
			\overset{\color{blue}{f}}{\displaystyle e^{2x} \vphantom{\big]'}} \cdot 
			\overset{\color{blue}{g'}}{\frac{dy}{dx} \vphantom{\big]'}} + 
			\overset{\color{blue}{f'}}{2e^{2x} \vphantom{\big]'}} \cdot 
			\overset{\color{blue}{g}}{y \vphantom{\big]'}} =
			\frac{d}{dx}\big[
			\overset{\color{blue}{f}}{\displaystyle e^{2x} \vphantom{\big]'}} \cdot
			\overset{\color{blue}{g}}{y \vphantom{\big]'}}
			\big]
		</me>.
		Therefore, multiplying by <m>e^{2x}</m> allows us to rewrite the equation as:
		<me> \frac{d}{dx}\left[ e^{2x} \cdot y \right] = 5e^{2x} </me>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice that the new equation is now suitable for <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>. 
		<fn>
			If you are curious, the general solution is:
			<me> y = C e^{-2x} + 5e^{-2x} </me>.
		</fn>
	</p>
	<p>
		In summary, multiplying both sides of <xref ref="integrating-factor-eqn"/> by <m>e^{2x}</m> provided the missing piece needed to apply the <q>backward</q> product rule, resulting in a new equation that can be solved through direct integration. This factor is called the <em>integrating factor</em> and will be a critical component of the next section.
