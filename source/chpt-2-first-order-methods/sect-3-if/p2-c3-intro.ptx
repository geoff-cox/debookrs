		The next method is known as <em>integrating factor</em>.

		As mentioned in the introduction, the integration factor method is a technique used to solve a differential equation of the form <xref ref="if-standard-eqn"/>. Its approach can be summarized through by two main tasks:

		Both of these tasks are linked to concepts from calculus. In particular, task 1 is related to the product rule, while task 2 is related to anti-derivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. So, to better unstand how the integrating factor method works, let's review these two ideas first.

				Identify a differential equation as first order and linear.

	<p>
		This section will be focused on solving first order linear differential equations. Recall, a linear differential equation has the form
		<me> a_n(x)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)</me>
		and the first-order version of this is
		<me> a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x).</me>
		To simplify the notation for a first-order DE a bit further, it is common to divide both sides of this equation by <m>a_1(x)</m> and rename the resulting quotients as <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m>. In particular, we have
		<me>y' + \US{P(x)}{\UB{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \US{Q(x)}{\UB{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}</me>
		and so our goal for this section is to solve DEs in the form

		<men xml:id="if-standard-eqn"> y' + P(x)y = Q(x), </men>

		applying a method known as the "integrating factor technique".
	</p>

	<example xml:id="euler-example-motivation">
	
		<statement>
			<p>
				Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation 
				<me>
					y' = y^2 + x.
				</me>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
	
			<p>
				As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.
				<aside>
					<p>
						The <m>y^2</m> term makes the DE nonlinear.
					</p>
				</aside>
				This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms cannot be separated by multiplication. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.
