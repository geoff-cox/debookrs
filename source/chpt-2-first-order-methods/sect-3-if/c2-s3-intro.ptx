		As mentioned in the introduction, the integration factor method is a technique used to solve a differential equation of the form <xref ref="if-standard-form"/>. Its approach can be summarized through by two main tasks:

		Both of these tasks are linked to concepts from calculus. In particular, task 1 is related to the product rule, while task 2 is related to anti-derivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. So, to better unstand how the integrating factor method works, let's review these two ideas first.
