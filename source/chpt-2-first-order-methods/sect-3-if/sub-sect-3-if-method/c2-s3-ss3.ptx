<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Integrating Factor Method </title>

	<p>
		The integrating factor method uses a three-step strategy to solve first order linear differential equation in the <em>standard form</em>
		<fn>
			<p>
				Every linear differential equation looks like
				<me> 
					a_n(x)y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
				</me>.
				The first-order version of this is
				<me> 
					a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
				</me>,
				but we can divide both sides of this equation by <m>a_1(x)</m>, like so
				<me>
					y' + \us{P(x)}{\ub{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \us{Q(x)}{\ub{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}
				</me>.
				Since every first-order linear differential equations can always be written as
				<me> 
					y' + P(x)y = Q(x) 
				</me>,
				we call this the first-order linear <em>standard form</em>.
			</p>
		</fn>

		<men xml:id="if-standard-form"> 
			y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
		</men>.

		The heart of this method is the first step where you must find the correct integrating factor. The second step uses this factor to write the left side as a single derivative. Finally, the last step finds the solution by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>. 
	</p>

	<paragraphs><title> Step 1 Details </title>
		
		<p>
			For most beginners, the tricky part of this method is understanding the math behind how the integrating factor, in step 1, is found. So, let's carfully walk through this important process.
		</p>

		<p>
			Consider the differential equations (specific on the left, general on the right):
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<me> 
						y' + x^2 y = 5x 
					</me>,
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> 
						y' + P(x)y = Q(x) 
					</me>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Our goal is to rewrite the left side as a single derivative <m>\left(\left[ f \cdot g \right]'\right)</m> using the <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom"> backward product rule </xref>. However, this is impossible in its current form, so we need to multiply by a factor that will make it possible. Since we don't know what this factor is <em>yet</em>, we will call it <m>\mu</m>.
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\mu y' + 3x^2 \mu y = 5x\mu 
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\mu y' + P(x)\mu y = Q(x)\mu 
					</me>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Looking at the first term, <m>\mu y'</m>, you should see that the left side is almost the product rule <m>\left[ \mu y \right]'</m>, since the first term of this product rule is <m>\mu y'</m>. The second term is off, however, since it should be <m>\mu' y</m>. Let's take a closer look.
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\overset{\ds \mu}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \mu}} 	\cdot 
						\overset{\ds y'}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y'}} 		+ 
						\overset{\ds \color{blue}{\mu'}}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \color{blue}{\fbox{\(3x^2 \mu\)}}}}	\cdot 
						\overset{\ds y}		{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y}} 		= 
						5x\mu 
					</me>,
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\overset{\ds \mu}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \mu}} 	\cdot 
						\overset{\ds y'}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y'}} 		+ 
						\overset{\ds \color{blue}{\mu'}}	{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds \color{blue}{\fbox{\(P(x) \mu\)}}}}	\cdot 
						\overset{\ds y}		{\overset{\downarrow}{\vphantom{\Big[}\ds y}} 		= 
						Q(x)\mu 
					</me>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Notice that the product rule requires that the boxed functions be <m>\mu'</m>. That is, we must choose <m>\mu</m> so that its derivative is <m>3x^2 \mu</m> (left) or <m>P(x) \mu</m> (left). Amazing, we just found a separable differential equation hiding inside the original equation. In particular, we can solve
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\mu' = 3x^2 \mu
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\mu' = P(x) \mu
					</me>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			for <m>\mu</m> using separation of variables! Let's do it.
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>	\int \frac{1}{\mu}d\mu	\amp = \int 3x^2\ dx	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\ln|\mu|	\amp = x^3 + C	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\mu	\amp = \pm e^{x^3 + C}	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\mu	\amp = {\color{green} \us{C}{\fbox{\(\pm e^C\)}}} e^{x^3}	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\mu	\amp = Ce^{x^3}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>	\int \frac{1}{\mu}d\mu	\amp = \int P(x)\ dx	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\ln|\mu|	\amp = \int P(x) dx	</mrow>
						<mrow>	\mu	\amp = \pm e^{\int P(x) dx}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Since we only need one integrating factor, we can choose <m>C = 1</m> (left) and drop the <m>\pm</m> (right). By finding the missing piece to write the left side of each DE as a single derivative, we have completed step 1.

	<paragraphs><title> Step 2 Details </title>

		<p>
			With the integrating factor in hand, we are now ready to write the left side as a single derivative using the <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom"> backward product rule </xref>.

		<statement>
			<p>
				Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation 
				<me>
					y' = y^2 + x.

		</statement>

		<solution>
	
			<p>
				As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.
				<aside>
					<p>
						The <m>y^2</m> term makes the DE nonlinear.
					</p>
				</aside>
				This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms cannot be separated by multiplication. 
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.   
			</p>
	
		</solution>

	</example>

	

	
	<p>
		As we've been un-doing the product rule, we've
		always had two terms, one containing the dependent variable, usually <m>y</m>, and one
		containing its derivative, <m>y'</m>, as in <xref ref="undo_prod3" />.  In order to use this process
		to solve DEs, we'll want to have DEs that also have these properties.  In other words,
		we'll need a first order DE.  Further, we need to make sure the function itself is in a separate
		term from the derivative, and it needs to be to the first power and not inside another function.
		Hopefully these characteristics are jogging your memory, because these are precisely
		the characteristics we have in a linear DE.  In summary, we'll be able to use this method
		when we have a first order linear DE.  Let's work through one and we can summarize at the end.
	</p>

	<p>
		Consider the following DE.
		<me>x^2y' = 5x^3 + 2x^3y </me>
	</p>

	<p>
		First we note that this equation is first order and linear.
	</p>

	<p>
		Our first step would be to move closer to seeing the form shown in <xref ref="undo_prod3" />.
		As such, we will put the terms containing the derivative, <m>y'</m>, and the function, <m>y</m>, on the same of the equation.
		<me>x^2 y' - 2x^3 y = 5x^3</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		In an ideal world, we would immediately be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand
		side of the equation.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work right now, so we need to do a little work to
		force it to work. %Obviously this sentence is awful.
		We would still like to push this into the form shown in (<xref ref="undo_prod3" />), so we can first divide the entire equation by the coefficient on <m>y'</m>,
		<me>y' - 2x y = 5x,</me>
		and then multiply by the function <m>z</m> that will help us un-do the product rule.
		<men xml:id="int_factor_ex1"> z\cdot y' - 2x z\cdot y = z\cdot 5x </men>
	</p>

	<p>
		In Example 6, we showed that the function <m>z</m> we need is given by <m>z = e^{\int P(x) dx}</m>.  We need only identify the function <m>P(x)</m> as in (<xref ref="undo_prod3" />).
		For this DE, we have <m>P(x) = -2x</m>.  Take special note of the inclusion of the negative sign.
		Hence, we have
		<me>z = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int -2x dx} = e^{-x^2}.</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that we have assumed that the constant of integration is zero because we
		know we need just one function <m>z</m>, and we choose the simplest one.  Now we can replace
		the replace the <m>z</m>'s in Equation (<xref ref="int_factor_ex1" />) with <m>z = e^{-x^2}</m> to yield
		<me>e^{-x^2}\cdot y' - 2x e^{-x^2}\cdot y = 5xe^{-x^2}.</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		If we've done everything correctly so far, we should be able to undo the product rule
		on the left hand side.  We can identify functions <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as follows:
		<me>\underbrace{e^{-x^2}}_{\scriptsize f}\cdot \underbrace{y'}_{\scriptsize g'}
			- \underbrace{2x e^{-x^2}}_{\scriptsize f'}\cdot \underbrace{y}_{\scriptsize g}
				= 5xe^{-x^2}.</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		We need to verify at this step that if we take the derivative of <m>f(x) = e^{-x^2}</m>, we
		do actually get the expression we've labeled as <m>f'</m>.  In this case, we do get <m>f'(x) = -2xe^{-x^2}</m>,
		as expected, so we have correctly determined the function <m>z</m> that will help us un-do the
		product rule.  This function, that plays a central role in this solution technique, is called the
		<term> integrating factor </term>.
	</p>

	<p>
		We have identified how we can un-do the product rule so now we need to do just that.
		<me>\frac{d}{dx}\Big( \underbrace{e^{-x^2}}_{\scriptsize f}\cdot \underbrace{y}_{\scriptsize g} \Big)
			= 5xe^{-x^2}.</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		We have just made a huge step forward in solving this DE!  We have made it so that
		the unknown function <m>y</m> now appears in the equation only once, so we can now work to solve
		for <m>y</m>.  As it stands, the function <m>y</m> is inside a derivative, so we can integrate both sides
		(with respect to the independent variable).
		<me>\int \frac{d}{dx}\Big( e^{-x^2} \cdot y \Big)dx = \int 5xe^{-x^2}dx</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		The integration and differentiation will un-do each other on the left hand side.  On
		the right hand side, we need a substitution, <m>u = -x^2</m>, in order to achieve the integration.
		This means <m>du = -2x dx</m>, or equivalently <m>-\frac{1}{2}du =x dx.</m>
		<md>
			<mrow>	e^{-x^2} \cdot y	\amp = \int 5xe^{-x^2}dx	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 5\int e^{-x^2}\cdot x dx	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 5 \int e^{u}\cdot -\frac{1}{2} du	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = -\frac{5}{2}\int e^u du	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = -\frac{5}{2}\int e^u + C	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = -\frac{5}{2}e^{-x^2} + C	</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		We are almost done; we need only divide both sides of the equation by <m>e^{-x^2}</m>
		to solve for <m>y</m>.
		<me>y = -\frac{5}{2} + \frac{C}{e^{-x^2}}</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		While the equation above is a valid solution, we may prefer to rewrite the second
		term using rules of exponents to yield
		<me>y = -\frac{5}{2} + Ce^{x^2}.</me>
	</p>

	<p>
		We have now found the general solution to the DE.  As always, we can verify that
		we have found the correct solution by substituting back into the original DE. %Put this in a collapsible?
		<md>
			<mrow> \mbox{LHS}	\amp = x^2y'	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = x^2 \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left( -\frac{5}{2} + Ce^{x^2} \right)	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = x^2 \cdot \left( 0 + 2Cxe^{x^2} \right)	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 2C x^3 e^{x^2}	</mrow>
		</md>

		<md>
			<mrow>	\mbox{RHS}	\amp = 5x^3 + 2x^3y	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 5x^3 + 2x^3\left( -\frac{5}{2} + Ce^{x^2} \right)	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 5x^3 - 5x^3+ 2C x^3 e^{x^2}	</mrow>
			<mrow>			\amp = 2C x^3 e^{x^2}	</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Since we get the same result when we substitute our solution in on the right and left
		hand sides of the DE, we confirm that we did find the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's look at another example, and this time we will slightly streamline the process.
	</p>
