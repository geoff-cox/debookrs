<title> Questions </title>  

	<p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Explain the meaning of each of the variables <m>I, t, k,</m> and <m>N</m>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Write an initial condition based on the experimental data collected in class.
			</li>

			<li>
				Explain why the differential equation makes sense. What is the meaning of <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> (in terms of the real-world scenario) and why does the right-hand side of the DE make sense?
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
					There are two values of <m>I</m> that would make <m>\frac{dI}{dt}</m> equal to zero. In calculus, we would have called these critical values.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Name the two critical values.
					</li>

					<li>
						For each of the values you named in question 4a, explain their significance in terms of the spread of the illness, and explain why it makes sense that <m>\frac{dI}{dt}=0</m> for those values.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				Find the general solution for the differential equation. Use the number of people in our class as <m>N</m>, and use the initial condition you wrote in question 2. You’ll likely end up needing to do a partial fraction decomposition. This is a perfect time to review this skill because we’ll need it soon. Note that you will not yet have a value for <m>k</m>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Using the time at which half (or approximately half) of the class was infected, determine a value for <m>k</m>.
			</li>

			<li>
				Now that you have <m>k</m>, write down the solution to the DE.                                                                               
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
				Now that you have a solution, compare the solution to the data that was collected.

				<ul>
					<li>
						Plot both the data and the solution curve on the same axes. Make sure your axes are labeled, your plot has an appropriate title and a legend. Make sure your font is big enough and that the plot is readable. Recall that data is usually plotted with markers only, while we use lines to connect points on the model solution curve.
					</li>

					<li>
						Imagine that you are a scientist trying to understand the spread of a disease. You find data on several small, localized outbreaks like the one in our class. Which is better in helping to understand the nature of the disease: the model or the data? Be sure to explain and justify your thoughts on this question.
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		Variations on the Outbreak

		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
				Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. Instead of flipping a coin, students must roll a die to determine if they have contracted the disease. If they roll a one or a two, then they become infected; otherwise, they remain disease-free.

				<ul>
					<li>
						How would you expect the data to change?
					</li>

					<li>
						What parameter(s) change in the DE and/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
					Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. Instead of having 8 stations, there are only three stations.

				<ul>
					<li>
						How would you expect the data to change?
					</li>

					<li>
						What parameter(s) change in the DE and/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>

			<li>
				<p>
					Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. The number of students initially infected is 10.

				<ul>
					<li>
						How would you expect the data to change?
					</li>

					<li>
						What parameter(s) change in the DE and/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?
					</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
			</li>
