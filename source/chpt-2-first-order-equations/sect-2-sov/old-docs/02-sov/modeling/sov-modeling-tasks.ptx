		At least one student was infected with the incurable illness Math Excitis. Each round will consist of the following.

		<ul>
			<li>
				Students report to the station number they have been assigned for this round (station numbers are randomly generated).
			</li>
		
			<li>
				If there is at least one infected person at the station, all non-infected students flip a coin.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				If the coin lands heads up, the student becomes infected.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				If the coin lands tails up, the student remains healthy.
			</li>
		
			<li>
				The total number of infected students is recorded.
			</li>
		
		</ul>
	</p>

		This scenario yields the following differential equation: <m> \frac{dI}{dt} = kI(N-I)</m>.
