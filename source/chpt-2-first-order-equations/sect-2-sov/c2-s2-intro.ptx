		The first method we will discuss is known as <em>separation of variables</em>. This approach is based on the idea that a differential equation can be written in a way that allows its variables to be separated on opposite sides of the equation. This separation enables us to independently integrate both sides of the equation, thus arriving at the solution. Differential equations with this property are referred to as <em>separable</em>.

		We will start by explaining the concept of separability and the process of expressing it in <em>separable form</em>. After that, we will introduce the separation of variables method and explore some examples.

        A differential equation is said to be in separable form if it can be rewritten so that its variables are on opposite sides of the equation. This property is crucial for the separation of variables method, as it permits the integration of each side which yields the general solution. Recognizing and rewriting equations in this separable form is the first  step in applying the separation of variables technique.
