        The Laplace transform is a powerful tool for solving differential equations by exploiting integration by parts and the properties of exponential functions. Before we dive into the details, let's recall the basic formula for integration by parts:
        <me>\int u\ dv = uv - \int v\ du</me>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this equation, <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m>. So <m>dv = v' \, dt</m>, and <m>du = u' \, dt</m>. Now, we can rewrite this formula as:
        <me> 
			\ub{\int u v'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }v} = u v - \ub{\int v u'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }u}
		</me>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Notice how the derivative initially applied to <m>v</m> on the left-hand side shifts over to <m>u</m> on the right-hand side. This ability to transfer derivatives between functions within an integral forms the core idea behind the Laplace transform.
    </p>

	<p>
        Let's see this concept in action. Consider an integral of the form:
        <me>\int e^{-st} y' \, dt</me>,
        where <m>s</m> is a constant. By setting <m>u = e^{-st}</m> and <m>dv = y' \, dt</m> in our integration by parts formula, we get:
        <me> 
			\os{\quad (1)}{\int \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y'}}}} \ \us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y' dt}}}} = 
			\us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y}}}} \ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} - 
			\os{(2)}{\int \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} \ \us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{(-s e^{-st} \ dt \vphantom{y})}}}} =
			e^{-st} \, y + s \os{\quad (3)}{\int e^{-st} \, y \, dt}
		</me>.
    </p>

	<p>
        What's happening here? The derivative on <m>y'</m> in integral <m>(1)</m> is effectively transferred to the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m> in integral <m>(2)</m>, leaving an extra factor of <m>s</m> next to integral <m>(3)</m>. 
    </p>

	<p>
		This process of transferring derivatives between functions is a reoccuring theme in the Laplace transform method and in the coming sections, we will uncover how it uses this idea to solve a wide range of differential equations.
