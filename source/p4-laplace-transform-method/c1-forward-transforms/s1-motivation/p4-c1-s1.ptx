		The power of the Laplace transform lies in its ability to simplify the process of solving differential equations by leveraging the properties of integration by parts and the behavior of exponential functions. To illustrate this, let's revisit the integration by parts formula:
		<me> 
			\int u\ dv = uv - \int v\ du 
		</me>.
		Here, if <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m>, then <m>dv=v'\, dt</m> and <m>du=u'\, dt</m>. The formula can be rewritten as:
		<me> 
			\ub{\int u v'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }v} = u v - \ub{\int v u'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }u}
		</me>.
		Notice how the derivative initially applied to <m>v</m> on the left-hand side is transferred to <m>u</m> on the right-hand side. This property allows us to move derivatives from one function to another within an integral, a concept that is central to the Laplace transform.
	</p>

	<p>
		To see this in action, consider the integral
		<me> 
			\int e^{-st} y' \, dt
		</me>.
		Choosing <m>u = e^{-st}</m> and <m>dv = y' \, dt</m> in the integration by parts formula gives us
		<me> 
			\os{\quad (1)}{\int \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y'}}}} \ \us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y' dt}}}} = 
			\os{(2)}{\us{u}{\vphantom{\int}\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y}}}} \ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}}} - 
			\os{\quad (3)}{\int \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} \ \us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{(-s e^{-st} \ dt \vphantom{y})}}}}
		</me>.
		Here, we see that the derivative associated with <m>y'</m>, in integral <m>(1)</m>, was transferred onto <m>e^{-st}</m> and neither <m>(2)</m> nor <m>(3)</m> contain <m>y'</m>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As you will see in the next section, this process of systematically transferring derivatives to exponential functions is at the heart of the Laplace transform. So, it should be no surprise when you encounter both an integral and the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m> in its definition.
