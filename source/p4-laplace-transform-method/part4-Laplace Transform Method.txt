<part><title> Laplace Transform Method </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Solving an algebraic equation often involves isolating the unknown variable. However, in differential equations, the unknown is entangled within derivatives, making isolation more challenging. The Laplace Transform offers a powerful technique to temporarily reframe the equation, effectively <q>unwrapping</q> the derivatives and enabling a more straightforward isolation of the unknown, similar to algebra.
		</p>

		<p>
			By applying the Laplace Transform, the dependent variable is extracted from its derivatives and embedded within a special integral. This integral serves as a <q>container</q> that encapsulates the unknown function we seek. In this transformed state, these containers can be manipulated algebraically, allowing us to isolate the unknown function within. Once isolated, we can then revert the transform, releasing the function and revealing the solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			In essence, the Laplace Transform alters the mathematical landscape of a differential equation, simplifying the process of solving for the unknown function. This method is particularly powerful for tackling linear non-constant coefficient (LNCC) equations with discontinuous right-hand side functions.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				To begin our exploration of the Laplace Transform, we start with the first step in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace Transform Roadmap</xref>, known as the forward Laplace transform. This step is foundational, as it sets the stage for the subsequent transformations outlined in the roadmap.

				Applying the forward Laplace transform to a differential equation involves converting both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation into their Laplace-transformed counterparts.
			</p>

			<p>
				This section investigates how individual functions, like <m>-40e^{3t}</m> in step 1, are transformed into expressions such as <m>-\frac{40}{s-3}</m>. In the next section, we will show where the <m>s^2Y + 3sY + 2Y + 9</m> comes from in the forward transform.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Motivation </title>
			<p>
				The Laplace transform is a powerful tool for solving differential equations by exploiting integration by parts and the properties of exponential functions. Before we dive into the details, let's recall the basic formula for integration by parts:
				<me>\int u\ dv = uv - \int v\ du</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this equation, <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m>. So <m>dv = v' \, dt</m>, and <m>du = u' \, dt</m>. Now, we can rewrite this formula as:
				<me> 
					\ub{\int u v'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }v} = u v - \ub{\int v u'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }u}
				</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Notice how the derivative initially applied to <m>v</m> on the left-hand side shifts over to <m>u</m> on the right-hand side. This ability to transfer derivatives between functions within an integral forms the core idea behind the Laplace transform.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's see this concept in action. Consider an integral of the form:
				<me>\int e^{-st} y' \, dt</me>,
				where <m>s</m> is a constant. By setting <m>u = e^{-st}</m> and <m>dv = y' \, dt</m> in our integration by parts formula, we get:
				<me> 
					\os{\quad (1)}{\int \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y'}}}} \ \us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y' dt}}}} = 
					\us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y}}}} \ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} - 
					\os{(2)}{\int \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} \ \us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{(-s e^{-st} \ dt \vphantom{y})}}}} =
					e^{-st} \, y + s \os{\quad (3)}{\int e^{-st} \, y \, dt}
				</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				What's happening here? The derivative on <m>y'</m> in integral <m>(1)</m> is effectively transferred to the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m> in integral <m>(2)</m>, leaving an extra factor of <m>s</m> next to integral <m>(3)</m>. 
			</p>

			<p>
				This process of transferring derivatives between functions is a reoccuring theme in the Laplace transform method and in the coming sections, we will uncover how it uses this idea to solve a wide range of differential equations.
