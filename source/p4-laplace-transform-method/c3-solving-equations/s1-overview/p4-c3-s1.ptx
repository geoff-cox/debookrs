		At this point, the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">roadmap</xref> introduced at the beginning of this chapter should start to come together. The steps have been explored in previous sections, and now it is time to apply them in sequence to solve a complete initial-value problem. We start by applying the forward Laplace transform to the entire differential equation (Step 1), which temporarily encases the unknown inside <m>Y(s)</m>. Next, you use algebra to isolate <m>Y(s)</m> (Step 2a). After that, you prepare for the backward transform by breaking <m>Y(s)</m> into a sum of functions that correspond to known Laplace transforms (Step 2b). Finally, you apply the backward transform to <m>Y(s)</m> to recover the solution, <m>y(t)</m> (Step 3).

		The complete strategy for this method is outlined as follows:

			The particular solution to the initial-valued differential equation
			<men xml:id="lt-method-de">
				y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\, y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1\, y' + a_0\, y = g(t)
			</men>
			and given initial conditions, follows from these steps:
		
			<dl width="narrow">
				<li xml:id="lt-step-1"><title>Step 1: Apply the Forward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Apply the Laplace transform, <m>\laplacesym</m>, to both sides of <xref ref="lt-method-de" />. Use the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table</xref> and <xref ref="lt-properties-table" text="custom">properties</xref> to convert each term into a function of <m>s</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-2a"><title>Step 2a: Solve for <m>Y(s)</m></title>
					<p>
						Use algebra to isolate <m>Y(s)</m> as a function of <m>s</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-2b"><title>Step 2b: Prepare for the Backward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Use techniques such as completing the square or partial fraction decompoition to rewrite <m>Y(s)</m> as a sum of <m>s</m>-functions found in the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table of common transforms</xref>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-3"><title>Step 3: Apply the Backward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Apply the inverse Laplace transform, <m>\laplacesym^{-1}</m>, to both sides of the <m>Y(s)</m> equation to get the solution <m>y(t)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>

	<p>
		By following these steps, the Laplace Transform Method provides a clear path from the original differential equation to its solution, leveraging the power of both forward and backward transforms.
