		We are now going to discuss the steps involved in the <em>separation of variables</em> method. In order to use this method, the differential equation must be first-order and be <xref ref="def-separable" text="custom">separable</xref>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Identifying a differential equation as first-order is as simple as observing the presence of a first derivative and no higher derivatives. In comparison, determining that an equation is separable is not always immediately apparent. Sometimes, it requires some algebra to rearrange the equation into a form where the method can be applied.

			Suppose a differential equation can be written in the form,
			<me xml:id="sov-method-de">
				\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y) \qquad \text{(order 1, separable)}.
			</me>
			Then the general solution can be determined through the steps below.
		</p>
		<dl width="narrow">
			<li xml:id="sov-step-1"><title> Step 1: Separate </title>
				<me>
					\frac{1}{g(y)} \ \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)
				</me>
			</li>
			<li xml:id="sov-step-2"><title> Step 2: Integrate </title>
				<me>
					\int \frac{1}{g(y)} \underset{=\ dy}{\underbrace{\frac{dy}{dx}\ dx}} = \int f(x) \ dx
				</me>
			</li>
			<li xml:id="sov-step-3"><title> Step 3: Finalize </title>
				<p>
					Isolate <m>y</m> (if possible), and combine constants.
