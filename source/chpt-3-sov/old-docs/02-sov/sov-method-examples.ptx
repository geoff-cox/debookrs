				<p>
					You actually don't need separation of variables to solve for <m>y</m>. In fact, you might recognize that finding <m>y</m> is the same as asking 
					<blockquote>
						<q>What do you take the derivative of to get <m>x^2</m> </q> ?
					</blockquote> 
					We know that this is just the anti-derivative of <m>x^2</m> or <m>y = \frac13x^3 + C</m>. Nevertheless, we will illustrate the steps of separation of variables to show that you do get what you would expect.

			<solution>
	
				<p>
					This differential equation is first order. Next, we need to check that this differential equation is separable by converting it into the form <me>\quad \DS  \frac{dy}{dx} = \big( 6x^2+1 \big)\cdot \big( \frac{1}{y^2} \big).</me>

					Note: We get <m>\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx} dx = dy</m> from calculus, where <m>dy</m> is called the differential of <m>y</m>. We are not actually cancelling the <m>dx</m> terms.

				<!--
				<p>
					Second, we note that when we have an indefinite integral, we find a family of solutions, and therefore we usually add a "<m>+ C</m>" to annotate the family of solutions. In this case, we will have a family of solutions on the left hand side of the equation and a separate family of solutions on the right hand side of the equation. However, we would not want to assume that it's the same `<m>+ C</m>" on both sides of the equation, so we will annotate one by <m>C_1</m> and the other by <m>C_2.</m>

					<p>
						Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. This gives:
						<md>
							<mrow xml:id="eqn_w_two_constants_00"> \frac{y^3}{3} + C_1	\amp= 2x^3 + x + C_2	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
		
					<p>
						This might feel done, but we should step back and think about what our goal is. Remember, we are looking for an unknown function that satisfies the DE. In this case, our unknown function is <m>y</m>, so we should solve for <m>y</m>. Let's carefully isolate <m>y</m> step by step. We begin by grouping the constants together
						<me> \frac{y^3}{3} = 2x^3 + x + (C_2 - C_1)</me>
					</p>
		
					<p>
						Since <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m> are both constants, it stands to reason that <m>C_2 - C_1</m> is a constant as well. Therefore, we can collapse this difference down to one constant, <m>C_3</m>:
						<fn>
							In further examples of this section, we will omit this step of combining multiple constants and just write <m>C</m>.
						</fn>
						<men xml:id="eqn_w_one_constant_00">
							\frac{y^3}{3} = 2x^3 + x + C_3
						</men>
					</p>
				</p>
		
				<!--
				<p>
					Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (<xref ref="eqn_w_two_constants" />) with the equivalent equation (<xref ref="eqn_w_one_constant" />)we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called <m>C</m>. We could repeat this process every time we use the separation of variable solution technique. We'll always end up integrating both sides of the equation, we'll always end up grouping the constants together on one side of the equation, and we'll always re-name the difference of constants to name it a single constant. Since we end up repeating those same steps, we will typically omit the steps where we write down constants on both sides of the equation, then combine them to form a new one. In the next example, you'll see that we cut to the chase and write the result of just having one constant on one side of the equation.

					Next, we want to solve for y.

				<p>
					Since <m>C_3</m> is a constant, it should be clear that  <m>3C_3</m>  is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, <m>C_4</m>. In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant <m>C</m>:
					<me>     y  \amp = \sqrt[3]{6x^3 + 3x + C_4}.</me>

				Recall, we already showed this differential equation is separable in <xref ref="example-separable-01" />, converting it into the form <me>\quad \DS  \frac{dy}{dx} = \big( 2x \big)\cdot \big( 3 - 5y \big).</me>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Next, we will use algebra to move all the <m>y</m> terms to the left and all the <m>x</m> terms to the right.
				<me>\frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x.</me>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to <m>x</m>, like so
				<me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}\frac{dy}{dx}dx = \int 2x\ dx </me>
				<me> \int \frac{1}{3 - 5y}dy = \int 2x\ dx.</me>
			</p>
	
	
			<p xml:id='integration'>
				<p>
					Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. Using the substitution <m>u = 3-5y</m>, we can integrate the left-hand side as <m>-\frac15\ln|3-5y|+C_1</m>. This gives:

			<p>
				Next, multiply both sides of the equation by <m>-5</m> and then exponentiate both sides to undo the logarithm.
				<md>

			<p>
				Now, we need to get the <m>y</m> outside of the absolute value function. Dropping the absolute value signs on the left hand side requires adding "<m>\pm</m>" to the right hand side:

				Since <m>C_3</m> is a constant, it should be clear that the whole expression inside the parentheses is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, <m>C_4</m>. In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant <m>C</m>:

		<p>
			Let's try another example, and then we can step back and see if we can generalize this method of solution.

			<solution>
			<p>
				Clearly, this DE is first order, but is it separable? In order to determine this, we isolate the derivative on the left hand side of the equation.
				<me>z' = z^2 + 1</me>
				We can immediately see that this is separable with the following grouping:
				<me>z' = \big( 1 \big)\big(z^2 + 1\big).</me>
				Have you noticed that we don't even know what the independent variable is?  There's no information provided that lets us know.
				<fn>
					If you run across a situation like this in the context of a real-world scenario, you might think about the meaning of the variables. Is the quantity changing with respect to time? If so, then <m>t</m> might be an appropriate independent variable. If the quantity changes spatially, then you might consider using <m>x</m> for the independent variable since we often use that variable to represent a distance along an <m>x</m>-axis. We don't have any context here, so we can choose any variable we like (except <m>z</m>, of course!).
				</fn>
			</p>
			<p>
				We'll proceed by assuming that the independent variable is <m>t</m>. Then we can write the derivative as <m>dz/dt</m>, and then completely separate as follows.

					<mrow> 					z'	\amp= \big( 1 \big) \big(z^2 + 1\big)	</mrow>

					<mrow> \frac{1}{z^2+1}dz	\amp= 1dt									</mrow>

				<p>
				As in the previous example, we don't have to check our answer, but one of the best parts about DEs is that we always can check, which means we can really know if we have the right solution. Let's check this one. We will substitute our solution back into the DE and verify that when we do, we get the same thing on both sides of the equation.

				<p>
				Now that we've practiced this solution technique a couple of times, let's summarize.
				</p>
	
			</example>
	
			<p>
			<term>Key ideas:  Separation of Variables</term>
	
			Suppose we have a DE such that <m>y</m> is the dependent variable and <m>x</m> is the independent variable. The separation of variables solution technique can be used if:
			<ol>
				<li> it is a first-order DE, and </li>
				<li> the derivative can be written as the product of two functions, where
					one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>y</m>,
					and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>x</m>,
					as in
					<me>\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \cdot g(y).</me>
					</li>
			</ol>
	
			If we these conditions are true, then we completely separate the variables by carefully isolating the dependent variable on the left hand side and the independent variable on the right hand side, typically using multiplication and/or division (and typically not using addition and/or subtraction). Then we integrate both sides and solve for the dependent variable, if possible.
			</p>
	
			<p>
			Pitfalls:
				*separating in such a way that a differential (such as <m>dy</m>, <m>dx</m> or <m>dt</m>) ends up
				in the denominator
				*algebra to separate
				*integration
				*algebra to solve for the dependent variable after integration
			*
			<aside>
				* Things to consider:
				<line>*An IVP?  have we prepped for that?</line>
				<line>*explicit versus implicit solution?</line>
				<line>*mention that we can't integrate with 1/dx or 1/dy</line>
				<line>*mention/use the vocabulary of general solution vs. particular solution vs. explicit vs. implicit vs. "solve"</line>

				It's always worth it when you first start solving DEs to step back and make sure you identify independent and dependent variables. Here <m>z</m> is dependent and <m>y</m> is independent. That means when we're done we hope to have a function

				Now that we have solved for the derivative, is it possible write the right hand side of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m> and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>y</m>?  That is, we'd like to write the DE in the form suggested below.
	
					<me>
					\frac{dz}{dy} = \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no z's}} \Big) \cdot
					\Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no x's}} \Big)
					</me>
	
				Hopefully you can see that there is a way, by factoring <m>y</m> out of each term on the right hand side, as below.
	
					<me>\frac{dz}{dy} = y(1 + z)</me>
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				Now we need to completely separate variables.
	
					<me>\frac{1}{1+z}dz = ydy</me>
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				The next step will be to integrate both sides of the equation. (If the integral on the right hand side is at all questionable to you, you should do take an extra step and actually do the substitution <m>u = 1+z.</m>)
	
				<md>
					<mrow> \int \frac{1}{1+z}dz	\amp= \int ydy</mrow>
					<mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
				</md>
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				As before, we write only one constant of integration (recall that we're skipping a couple of steps here; details provided in Example 6).
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				Remember that our goal is to solve for the unknown function <m>z</m>. Since it's currently inside of a logarithm, we exponentiate both sides of the equation.
				<md>
					<mrow> \ln|1+z|	\amp= \frac{1}{2}y^2 + C</mrow>
					<mrow> e^{\ln|1+z|}	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2 + C}</mrow>
					<mrow> |1+z|	\amp= e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}\cdot e^C</mrow>
				</md>
				</p>
	
				<p>
				We continue solving for <m>z</m>.
	
				<md>
					<mrow> 1+z	\amp= \underbrace{\pm e^C}_{\text{rename } A} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}</mrow>
					<mrow> 1+z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}		</mrow>
					<mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1	</mrow>
				</md>
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				Now we can use that initial condition, <m>z(0) = 5</m>, to solve for <m>A</m>. The initial condition can be read,
				"when <m>y</m> is zero, <m>z</m> is 5."  We substitute into our solution accordingly.
	
				<md>
					<mrow> z	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1</mrow>
					<mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^{\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0^2} - 1</mrow>
					<mrow> 5	\amp= Ae^0 - 1</mrow>
					<mrow> 6	\amp= A\cdot 1</mrow>
					<mrow> 6	\amp= A</mrow>
				</md>
	
				<aside>
					* mention that we can't call <m>A = 6</m> our solution!
				</aside>
	
				</p>
	
				<p>
				Therefore, the solution to the IVP is
	
					<me>z = 6e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1.</me>
	
				</p>
