		Tips for identifying separable DEs:
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						Examine the Structure: Start by looking at the differential equation's structure. Is the derivative dxdy expressed as a product of two functions, one in x and the other in y?
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p>
						Attempt to Rearrange: If the equation is not obviously in the separable form, try rearranging it. Can you express it so that all x terms are on one side and all y terms on the other?
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p>
						Check for Exclusive Dependence: Ensure that each part of the equation depends on only one variable. If you find terms where both x and y are intertwined in a single function, the equation is not separable.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p>
						Beware of Implicit Forms: Some separable equations might not be immediately apparent. For example, an equation like = xy =y can be rearranged into a separable form.
					</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<p>
						Watch Out for Tricky Cases: Some equations might look separable but aren't, and vice versa. Developing an eye for these nuances comes with practice and familiarity.
					</p>
				</li>

			Show that the first order differential equation is separable.
			<me>  x\frac{dy}{dx} + 10x^2y = 6x^2.</me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				In order to answer the question, we need to see if it can be rearranged in the form of <xref ref="separable-form" text="type-local" />. Let's start by isolating <m>dy/dx</m> on the left hand side of the equation, like so:
				<me>  x\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^2 - 10x^2y</me>
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x - 10xy. </me>
				Finally, the left hand side should be a <em>product</em> of functions where
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} = \Big(\text{no } y \text{'s}\Big) \cdot
						\Big(\text{no } x \text{'s}\Big)
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				For this DE, it is possible because both terms have <m>2x</m> as a common factor.
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \Big( 2x \Big)\cdot \Big( 3 - 5y \Big). </me>
				Hence, this differential equation <em>is separable</em>.

		<p>
			In general, there is more than one way to separate a differential equation. In the previous example, we could have also been separated it in any of the following ways.
			<ul>
				<li><m> \DS\frac{dy}{dx} = \big( x \big)\cdot \big( 6 - 10y \big) </m></li>
				<li><m> \DS\frac{dy}{dx} = \big( -2x \big)\cdot \big( 5y - 3 \big) </m></li>
				<li><m> \DS\frac{dy}{dx} = \left( -\frac{2}{5}x \right)\cdot
										\left( y - \frac{3}{5} \right) </m></li>
			</ul>
			All of these are appropriate ways to demonstrate that the DE is separable. You may find after you have solved a few separable DEs that you prefer one of these forms over another, but they all will get you to the same solution.

			Determine if the following DE is separable.
			<me> \frac{dP}{dt} = \frac{Pt}{P^2 + 1} </me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				This looks a little different because the variables are not <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, but the strategy is the same. In this case, we are looking for
				<me>
					\frac{dP}{dt} = \Big(\text{no } P \text{'s}\Big) \cdot
						\Big(\text{no } t \text{'s}\Big)
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				First, we need to note that the DE is first order; if it's not, we can immediately conclude that the DE is not separable. Second, we can easily separate the variables by pulling the <m>t</m> off the numerator. <me> \frac{dP}{dt} = \Big( \frac{t}{1} \Big)  \cdot \left( \frac{P}{P^2 + 1} \right) </me> Hence, this differential equation <em>is separable.</em>

		<p>
		While you may find yourself uncomfortable with different variable names, you are strongly discouraged from re-writing the DE in terms of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. Depending on the viewpoint, the variable names could have important context built into them. For example, <m>P</m> may represent a population and <m>t</m> often represents time. If we switch to <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, we may bury that meaning and make it harder to interpret whether our solution (when we finally find one) makes any sense.

			Determine if the following DE is separable.
			<me> x - \frac{dy}{dx} = - y </me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				As before, we note that the DE is first order and then we proceed to isolate the derivative. This results is the following.
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = x + y </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				From here, we want to see if it's possible that we can write the right hand of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>x</m>. In this example, there is no way to separate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> by writing the right hand side as a <em>product</em>, and therefore this DE <em>is not separable</em>.

			Determine if the following DE is separable.
			<me> \frac{dz}{dt} = \cos^2 z </me>
		</p>

		<solution>

			<p>
				Again, we note that the DE is first order. Since the derivative is already isolated, we need only determine whether we can write the right hand of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m>, and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>t</m>. Consider the following equivalent equation. <me> \frac{dz}{dt} =  \big( 1 \big)  \cdot \big( \cos^2 z \big) </me> This may seem like a bit of a cop-out, but we have actually satisfied the definition of separable. The first factor is a function that does not contain any <m>z</m>'s, and the second factor is a function that does not contain and <m>t</m>'s. It doesn't matter that the first factor is a constant function; it could be any function we like, so long as it doesn't contain the dependent variable <m>z</m>. We have demonstrated that this DE <em>is separable</em>.

			Determine if the following DE is separable.
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 11e^{4x + 3y}. </me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				As usual, we begin by noting that the DE is first order. Since the derivative is already isolated, we need only determine whether we can write the right hand of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>x</m>. You might be looking at that addition sign and the fact that those terms are in the exponent of a function, and thinking there's no way this one is separable. Here we need to reach back to rules of exponents<m>^1</m> and realize that we can write that exponential as
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 11e^{4x}\cdot e^{3y}.</me>
				<aside>
				<m>^1</m> For a review of the rules of exponents, go here. Strong algebra skills will be critical moving forward as we'll use these rules throughout this text.

			</p>

			<p>
				After we've done this algebraic manipulation, it should be clear that this DE <em>is separable</em>, and we can separate as
				<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = \Big(11e^{4x}\Big)\cdot \Big(e^{3y}\Big) \quad\text{or}\quad
				\frac{dy}{dx} = \Big(e^{4x}\Big)\cdot \Big(11e^{3y}\Big).
