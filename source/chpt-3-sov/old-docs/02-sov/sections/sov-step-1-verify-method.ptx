			When studying differential equations, you will encounter different methods that are suitable for different types of equations. The separation of variables method is a direct approach that is particularly useful, but only if the differential equation is first-order and separable.

		<p>
			Identifying a differential equation as first-order means observing the presence of a first derivative and no higher derivatives. In comparison, seeing that an equation is separable can be challenging as separability is not always immediately apparent. Sometimes, it requires some algebra to rearrange the equation into a form where the method can be applied. We will start with the definition and then finish with a few examples.
