			The final piece to this method involves isolating the solution, if possible, and applying any initial conditions that are given with the differential equation. We say "if possible" because sometimes, after integrating both sides of the equation, you get an expression that is impossible to solve for <m>y</m> as an explicit function of <m>x</m>. Let's take a look at an example of a situation where you can solve for <m>y</m> and one where you cannot.
