<subsubsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Showing Separable II </title>

    <p>
        In the previous modules, we only considered differential equations where the derivative, <m>dy/dx</m>, was isolated on the left-hand side. We will now explore a few examples where you need to first isolate the derivative before you can separate the variables, like we did in the last section. 
    </p>

    <example xml:id="showing-separable-ii-example-01">

        <p>
            Determine if the following DE is separable.
            <me> \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} \sin x + y = 1 </me>
        </p>

        <solution>
            <p>
                This is sort of a trick question to get you in the habit of checking the order of a differential equation. Since this DE is not first-order, <em>it is not separable</em>.
            </p>
        </solution>

    </example>

    <example xml:id="showing-separable-ii-example-02">

        <p>
            Determine if the following DE is separable.
            <me> x - \frac{dy}{dx} = - y </me>
        </p>

        <solution>
            <p>
                We see that this DE is first-order, so now we need to see if it can be rearranged in <xref ref="separable-form" text="custom">separable form</xref>. Isolating <m> \frac{dy}{dx} </m> we get
                <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = x + y </me>
                and it should be clear that there is no way to separate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> by <em>multiplication</em>, and therefore this DE <em>is not separable</em>.
            </p>
        </solution>

    </example>

    <example xml:id="showing-separable-by-isolating-dydx-01">

        <p>
            Show that the first order differential equation is separable.
            <me>  x\frac{dy}{dx} + 10x^2y = 6x^2.</me>
        </p>

        <solution>
            <p>
                As before, let's isolate <m>dy/dx</m> on the left side of the equation, like so
                <me>  x\frac{dy}{dx} = 6x^2 - 10x^2y</me>
                <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{x}\left(6x^2 - 10x^2y\right) </me>
                <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 6x - 10xy. </me>
                Now that the derivative is isolated on the left, we attempt to separate the variables on the right. Factoring <m>2x</m> out of both terms gives
                <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2x \cdot \left( 3 - 5y \right) </me>
                and we see that the differential equation <em>is separable</em>.
                <note  xml:id="note-remark"><title> There can be multiple ways to separate a DE </title>
                    In general, there is more than one way to separate a differential equation. This example could have been separated in either of the following ways:
                    <me>\frac{dy}{dx} = x \cdot ( 6 - 10y ), \qquad \frac{dy}{dx} = ( -2x )\cdot ( 5y - 3 ) </me>
                    The only thing that matters is that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are separated.
                </note>
