        A differential equation is said to be in separable form if it can be rewritten so that its variables are on opposite sides of the equation. This property is crucial for the separation of variables method, as it permits the integration of each side which yields the general solution. Recognizing and rewriting equations in this separable form is the first  step in applying the separation of variables technique.
