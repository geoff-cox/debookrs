        INTRO TO THE PRODUCT RULE REVIEW FOR THE IF METHOD
    </p>

    <p>
		There is no one, single solution technique that will solve all differential equations. Every new technique that we explore in this text will always start by grouping a set of differential equations that share one or more properties in common. The first solution technique considers only differential equations that are both first-order and separable. You have seen an example of <xref ref="example-order-1" text="custom">first-order DE</xref>, but is it separable?  We have not mentioned separable yet and so this is where we need to begin.

			The general solution to the first-order linear differential equation,
			<men xml:id="if-method-de">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)\ y = Q(x),
			</men>
			can be determined through the following steps...
		
			<dl width="narrow">
				<li xml:id="if-step-1"><title> Step 1: Verify Method </title>
					<p>
						Show the DE has order 1 and is linear.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="if-step-2"><title> Step 2: Find Integrating Factor </title>
					<p>
						Multiply both sides of <xref ref="if-method-de"/> by <m>\mu</m>, set <m>\mu' = \mu P(x)</m>, and find <m>\mu</m>.
						<men xml:id="if-method-de-with-mu">
							\underset{\text{product rule}}{\underbrace{\mu\ y' + \underset{\mu'}{\fbox{$\mu P(x)$}} \ y}} = \mu\ Q(x)
						</men>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="if-step-3"><title> Step 3: Rewrite DE </title>
					<p>
						"Undo the product rule" on the left side of <xref ref="if-method-de-with-mu"/> with this <m>\mu</m>,
						<men xml:id="if-method-de-rewrite"> 
							\frac{d}{dx}\left[\mu\ y\right] = \mu\ Q(x). 
						</men>
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="if-step-4"><title> Step 4: Integrate &amp; Finalize Solution </title>
					<p>
						Integrate both sides of <xref ref="if-method-de-rewrite"/> and solve for <m>y</m>.
