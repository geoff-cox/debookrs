        ARE WE USING ANY OF THIS?
    </remark>
    


    <p>
        In this chapter, we will study a solution technique that will help us solve differential equations that are first order and linear. Consider this (carefully selected) example.
        <men xml:id="original_de">
            x^7 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 7x^{6}\cdot y = e^x
        </men>
        Notice that the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and the independent variable is <m>x</m>, so we seek to find a formula for <m>y</m> in terms of <m>x</m>. The DE is also first order and linear.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        What makes this DE special is that the left hand side can be rewritten as follows.
        <men xml:id="rewritten_de">
            \frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big) = e^x
        </men>
        We can verify this by actually using the product rule to take the derivative on the left hand side:
        <md>
            <mrow>\frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp=  \frac{d}{dx}\Big(\underbrace{x^7}_{f(x)} \cdot \underbrace{y}_{g(x)} \Big)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp= f(x) \cdot g'(x) + f'(x) \cdot g(x)</mrow>
            <mrow>   \amp= x^7 \cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + 7x^{6}\cdot y</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        Now that we have confirmed that Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/> is equivalent to Equation <xref ref="original_de"/>, we can proceed in solving the DE. 
    </p>
            
    <p>
        The unknown function we want to solve for is <m>y</m>, and it is part of the product we are taking the derivative of in Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/>. So we begin by undoing that differentiation by integrating both sides of Equation <xref ref="rewritten_de"/> with respect to <m>x</m>:
        
        <md>
            <mrow>\int \frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^7 \cdot y \Big) dx \amp= \int e^x dx</mrow>
            <mrow xml:id="almost_done">x^7 \cdot y      \amp= e^x + C</mrow>
        </md>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        We can now just divide both sides of <xref ref="almost_done" text="custom">Equation</xref> by the coefficient on <m>y</m> to obtain the general solution.
        <me>y = \frac{e^x}{x^7} + \frac{C}{x^7}</me>
    </p>
            
    <p>
        Recall that we said this was a carefully selected DE. This very special DE had the property that we could undo the product rule on its left hand side. This is not, in general, the case when we encounter a first order linear DE. For example, consider this DE.
    </p>
            
    <p>
        (use one of the first examples we do in the book??)
    </p>
            
    <p>
        We cannot immediately undo the product rule here, but there is some hope. We do see the unknown function <m>y</m> and its derivative, so we have some of the stuff we need to undo the product rule. What weâ€™ll see in this chapter is that we can manipulate the DE so that we will be able to undo the product rule and proceed to solve as we did in the example above, and so we begin this chapter by focusing on the details around making that possible.
    </p>


    <p>
        The integration factor technique relies heavily on our understanding of the product rule for differentiation, so let's quickly recall what this looks like and go over some examples.

        DO WE WANT A SUMMARY?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Let's summarize the procedure we have been working on.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <term> Solving First Order Linear DEs with an Integrating Factor </term>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Verify that the DE is first order and linear.  (Don't overlook this step!!  Nothing that follows here makes any sense if the DE isn't both first order and linear.)	
            </li>

            <li>  
                Rearrange the DE to put it in standard form for this solution technique.
                <me>\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x)</me>
                In standard form, the dependent variable and the derivative are on the left hand side	of the equation and the coefficient on the derivative is 1.
                (Here we assume that <m>x</m> is the independent variable and <m>y</m> is the dependent variable;	this will look different if your DE has different independent and dependent variables).	
            </li>

            <li>  
                Identify the function <m>P(x)</m> and then find the integrating factor <m>z = e^{\int P(x) dx}.</m> (Note that we integrate with respect to the independent variable. We also need only one integrating factor, so we typically omit the <m>+C</m> that is ordinarily associated with	an indefinite integral.)
            </li>
            
            <li> Multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.	</li>
            
            <li> 
                Rewrite the left hand side of the DE by "un-doing" the product rule. This is the crucial step where you should check to make sure that you really can un-do the product rule. If you can't then check to make sure you correctly  determined determined the integrating factor.	
            </li>
            
            <li>  
                Integrate both sides of the equation (with respect to the independent variable). (Here you should have a constant of integration.)	
            </li>

            <li>  Solve for the dependent variable to get the general solution.	</li>
            
            <li>  If an initial condition is provided, apply it last to determine the value of the constant of integration.	</li>

        </ul>
    </p>
