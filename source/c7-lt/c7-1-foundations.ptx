		<p>
			To begin our exploration of the Laplace Transform, we start with the first step in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace Transform Roadmap</xref>, known as the forward Laplace transform. This step is foundational, as it sets the stage for the subsequent transformations outlined in the roadmap.

			</figure>
		</p>

		<p>
			Applying the forward Laplace transform to a differential equation involves converting both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation into their Laplace-transformed counterparts.
		</p>

		<p>
			This section investigates how individual functions, like <m>-40e^{3t}</m> in step 1, are transformed into expressions such as <m>\ds -\frac{40}{s-3}</m>. In the next section, we will show where the <m>s^2Y + 3sY + 2Y - 1</m> comes from in the forward transform.
		</p>
		
	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> Transferring Derivatives Inside an Integral </title>

		<p>
			To understand how the Laplace transform method simplifies differential equations into algebraic equations, we must revisit integration by parts from calculus. The minimalistic version of integration by parts formula is given by
			<me>
				\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Assuming <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, another version is given by
			<me>
				\int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }v}}{
					\us{u}{ \us{\uparrow}{\ul{ 
						u(t)
					}}} \ 
					\us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{
						{\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{v'\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}(t)} dt
					}}}
				}
				= \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ u(t) }}}\ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ v(t) }}} \Big|_{a}^{b}
					- \int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }u}}{
						\us{v}{ \us{\uparrow}{\ul{ v(t) }}} \ 
						\us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ {\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{u'\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}(t)} dt }}}
					}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This version of the formula clearly shows how the derviative on <m>v</m> (left integral) is transferred to <m>u</m> (right integral). This concept is a fundamental part of the Laplace transform method, especially when <m>u</m> is of the form <m>e^{-st}</m>, where <m>s</m> is a positive constant.
		</p>

		<p>
			To see why this may be useful, let <m>u(t) = e^{-st}</m> and <m>v(t) = y(t)</m>. Then, <m>u'(t) = -se^{-st}</m> and <m>v'(t) = y'(t)</m> and the formula becomes
			<me>
				\int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }y}}{ 
					e^{-st} \ {\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{y'\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}(t)}\ dt
				} = e^{-st} \ y(t) \Big|_{a}^{b}
				- \int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }e^{-st}}}{ 
					y(t) \ {\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{\left(-s e^{-st}\right)\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}}\ dt
				}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, the derivative on <m>y'</m> moved onto the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m>. Continuing to simplify the integral on the right, we arrive at the expression
			<aside><title> Clarification </title>
				<p>
					Since the integral is in terms of <m>t</m>, <m>s</m> is constant and can be pulled out of the integral.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<me>
				\int_{a}^{b} e^{-st}\vphantom{y'} \ y'(t) dt = \ub{e^{-st} \ y(t) \Big|_{a}^{b}  + s \int_{a}^{b} e^{-st} \, y(t) \, dt}_{\large\text{no derivatives of }y}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, two important observations are in order. First, the integral on the left, containing <m>y'</m>, can be rewritten in terms of an expression containing no <m>y</m> derivatives. Second, the only difference between the two integrals is an extra factor of <m>s</m>. Thus, one could view the derivative as being stored in <m>s</m>. This viewpoint is the essence behind the Laplace transform method and, in the next section, we will have a more clear view of differential equation's in this context.

	<subsection><title> Laplace Transform Definition </title>

		<p>
			In the previous section, we saw how derivatives of <m>y</m> can be transferred onto <m>e^{-st}</m> when they are both inside an integral. While differential equations have derivatives of <m>y</m> scattered throughout, there is no sign of <m>e^{-st}</m> or an integral. Therefore, we need to supply them ourselves.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, suppose we are given the equation
			<men xml:id="lt-model-eqn">
				y'' + 3y' + 2y = -40e^{3t}
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			First, we multiplying both sides by <m>e^{-st}</m>, like so
			<me>
				\left(y'' + 3y' + 2y\right) e^{-st} = -40e^{3t} e^{-st}
			</me>,
			where <m>s</m> is a positive constant and integrating both sides with respect to <m>t</m> to get
			<me>
				\int \left(y'' + 3y' + 2y\right) e^{-st} \, dt = \int -40e^{3t} e^{-st} \, dt
			</me>.
			Applying the linearity properties of the integral gives us
			<me>
				\ub{\int e^{-st} y''\ dt}_{\text{transfer 2 derivatives}}
				+ 3\ub{\int e^{-st} y'\ dt}_{\text{transfer 1 derivative}}
				+ 2\ub{\int e^{-st} y\ dt}_{\text{leave as-is}}
				= \ub{\int e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right)\ dt}_{\text{integrate}}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This <q>transformation</q> of equation <xref ref="lt-model-eqn"/> puts each term into a form where: (1) the derivatives of <m>y</m> can be transferred onto <m>e^{-st}</m>, left as-is or integrated directly. Later, we will show the details of each of these transformations and how an algebraic equation emerges from this complex expression. For now, we have enough to motivate the following definition of the Laplace transform.
		</p>

		<definition xml:id="laplace-transform-definition"><title>Laplace Transform</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Given a function <m>f(t)</m> defined for <m>t \geq 0</m>, its Laplace transform, denoted <m>\lap{f(t)}</m>, is defined by the integral
					<me>
						\lap{f(t)} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \, dt,
					</me>
					provided the integral converges. The resulting expression is a function of the variable <m>s</m>, typically denoted by the capital letter <m>F(s)</m>:
					<me>
						F(s) = \lap{f(t)}.
					</me>
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			You may recall that the <m>\infty</m> in the upper limit signals that we are dealing with an improper integral. In calculus, we learned that improper integrals can be understood as limits. Specifically,
			<me>
				\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\, dt = \ub{\lim_{b \to \infty} \ob{\int_0^b e^{-st} f(t)\, dt}^{\text{step 1: compute the integral}}}_{\text{step 2: compute the limit}}
			</me>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			While the integral involves <m>b</m>, <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, the integration is performed with respect to <m>t</m>. During the integration step, treat both <m>b</m> and <m>s</m> as constant. Once done, you should be left with only <m>b</m> and <m>s</m>. Finally, move on to the limit step where you treat <m>s</m> as constant and take <m>b \to \infty</m>. Let's walk through this with an example.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="laplace-example-constant"><title> Laplace Transform of a Constant Function </title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Find the Laplace transform of the constant function <m>f(t) = 5</m>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					By the definition above, we have the improper integral
					<men xml:id="lt-def-example-eqn-1">
						\lap{5} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot 5\ dt = \lim_{b \to \infty} \ub{\int_0^b 5e^{-st}dt}_{I}
					</men>.
					Assuming <m>s</m> and <m>b</m> are constant, we integrate <m>I</m> with respect to <m>t</m>:
					<me>
						I = \int_0^b 5e^{-st}dt = -\frac{5}{s}e^{-st}\Big|_{t=0}^{t=b} = -\frac{5}{s}\left[ e^{-sb} - 1 \right]
					</me>.
					Next, we compute the limit of <m>I</m> as <m>b \to \infty</m> (with <m>s</m> constant):
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\lim_{b \to \infty} -\frac{5}{s}\left[ e^{-sb} - 1 \right] 
								\amp <xref text="custom" ref="c7-1-example-explain-1"><m>\os{\large ‚ùî}{=}</m></xref> -\frac{5}{s} \lim_{b \to \infty} \Big[ e^{-sb} - 1 \Big]
						</mrow>
						<mrow>
								\amp = -\frac{5}{s} \Big[ \ub{\lim_{b \to \infty} e^{-sb}}_{L} - 1 \Big]
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
		
				<p>
					The limit, <m>L</m>, depends on the <term><xref ref="graph-of-e-to-x" text="custom">power of the exponential function</xref></term>, <m>e^{-sb}</m>, is going. Since <m>b \to \infty</m>, then there are two cases based on the sign of <m>s</m>:
					<aside>
						<p>
							Note, <m>s = 0</m> is not possible since, from the beginning, you would have
							<md>
								<mrow>	\int_0^{\infty} 5e^{-0t}dt	\amp = 5t\Big|_{t=0}^{t=\infty}	</mrow>
								<mrow>								\amp = \infty					</mrow>
							</md>,
							which does not converge.
						</p>
					</aside>
					<ol>
						<li> <m>s &gt; 0</m>: <m>\ -sb \to -\infty\ </m>, so <m>\ e^{-sb} \to 0\ </m> &amp; <m>L=0\ </m> (converges) </li>
						<li> <m>s &lt; 0</m>: <m>\ -sb \to +\infty\ </m>, so <m>\ e^{-sb} \to \infty\ </m> &amp; <m>L=\infty\ </m> (diverges) </li>
					</ol>
					By definition, the integral in a Laplace transform must converge, meaning <m>L</m> must converge. So, <m>L=0</m> and the Laplace transform is
					<me>
						\lap{5} = -\frac{1}{s} [0 - 1] = \frac{1}{s} \quad \text{for } s \gt 0
					</me>.
				</p>
			</solution>

		<p>
			Applying a similar process to other functions will enable us to begin constructing a library of common Laplace transforms that we can refer to when we start solving differential equations. In the next section, we will explore some of the most important properties of Laplace transforms and derive general formulas for finding them quickly.

	<subsection><title> Basic Properties and Rules </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				This subsection explores foundational properties and operational rules of the Laplace transform, focusing on their practical significance in solving differential equations.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title>Integration by Parts and Transfer of Derivatives</title>

			<p>
				Integration by parts is a powerful technique in calculus, essential for understanding how the Laplace transform effectively manages derivatives within integrals. Recall the integration by parts formula from calculus:
				<me>
					\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du.
				</me>
				In this formula, <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are differentiable functions of a variable, typically <m>t</m>, and the differential elements are <m>du = u'(t)\, dt</m> and <m>dv = v'(t)\, dt</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The strength of integration by parts in the context of the Laplace transform lies in its ability to transfer derivatives from one function to another. Specifically, this method allows us to shift derivatives originally acting on complicated functions onto simpler exponential functions, thus simplifying our integrals.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the integral:
				<me>
					\int e^{-st} y'(t)\, dt.
				</me>
				To demonstrate clearly how integration by parts transfers derivatives, we choose:
				<me>
					u = e^{-st}, \quad dv = y'(t)\, dt.
				</me>
				Then we have:
				<me>
					du = -s e^{-st}\, dt, \quad v = y(t).
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Applying integration by parts yields:
				<md>
					<mrow>
						\int e^{-st} y'(t)\, dt \amp = e^{-st} y(t) - \int y(t)\left(-s e^{-st}\right) dt \\
						\amp = e^{-st} y(t) + s \int e^{-st} y(t)\, dt.
					</mrow>
				</md>
				Notice that the derivative originally associated with <m>y'(t)</m> has now shifted onto the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m>, producing a simpler integral expression involving <m>y(t)</m> itself.
			</p>

			<p>
				This transfer of derivatives is fundamental to the Laplace transform method. By repeatedly applying this process, higher-order differential equations become algebraic equations in the transformed domain, significantly simplifying the task of solving them.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>The "Wrapping and Unwrapping" Analogy</title>

			<p>
				The Laplace transform can be intuitively understood through the analogy of "wrapping" and "unwrapping." When applied, the Laplace transform temporarily "wraps" derivatives and complex functions inside the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m>. This wrapping converts complicated derivatives into simpler algebraic forms that are easier to manipulate and solve.
			</p>

			<p>
				By embedding derivatives within the exponential function, the Laplace transform effectively shifts differential equations into an algebraic domain. In this new domain, algebraic operations‚Äîsuch as factoring, addition, and multiplication‚Äîcan be performed easily. This transformation significantly reduces complexity, turning the challenging task of solving differential equations into a simpler algebraic problem.
			</p>

			<p>
				The inverse Laplace transform, which we will explore in detail later, performs the complementary task of "unwrapping." It recovers the original function by reversing this wrapping process, thus revealing the solution to the original differential equation from its algebraic representation.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="wrapping-analogy-example">
				<title>Illustrating the "Wrapping" Analogy</title>
				<p>
					Consider the simple first-order differential equation:
					<me>
						y'(t) - 4y(t) = 0.
					</me>
					Applying the Laplace transform, we "wrap" the derivatives in an exponential function as follows:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\lap{y'(t)} - 4\lap{y(t)} = \lap{0}
						</mrow>
						<mrow>
							\left[sY(s) - y(0)\right] - 4Y(s) = 0.
						</mrow>
					</md>
					Notice the complexity of the derivative <m>y'(t)</m> is now simplified to an algebraic expression involving <m>Y(s)</m>, the Laplace transform of <m>y(t)</m>. The differential equation has thus been converted into a straightforward algebraic equation:
					<me>
						(s - 4)Y(s) = y(0).
					</me>
					This algebraic equation is easy to solve for <m>Y(s)</m>, clearly demonstrating how the "wrapping" step significantly simplifies the problem.
				</p>
			</example>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>Linearity of the Laplace Transform</title>

			<p>
				The Laplace transform possesses a crucial property known as linearity, reflecting its ability to handle sums, differences, and scalar multiples of functions easily. Explicitly, the linearity property states:
				<me>
					\lap{a f(t) + b g(t)} = a \lap{f(t)} + b \lap{g(t)},
				</me>
				where <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, and <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are functions whose Laplace transforms exist.
			</p>

			<p>
				This property simplifies the process of transforming complex functions by allowing us to break them down into simpler components. Let's illustrate this clearly with a straightforward example:
			</p>

			<example xml:id="linearity-example">
				<title>Using Linearity to Compute a Laplace Transform</title>
				<p>
					Find the Laplace transform of the function:
					<me>
						h(t) = 3 - 2e^{5t} + 7t.
					</me>
					Applying linearity, we have:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							\lap{3 - 2e^{5t} + 7t} \amp = 3\lap{1} - 2\lap{e^{5t}} + 7\lap{t}.
						</mrow>
					</md>
					Using previously computed transforms, we obtain:
					<md>
						<mrow>
							= 3 \cdot \frac{1}{s} - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{s - 5} + 7 \cdot \frac{1}{s^2}, \quad s > 5.
						</mrow>
					</md>
					Thus, linearity has reduced the complexity of this problem significantly.
				</p>
			</example>

			<p>
				The linearity of the Laplace transform is particularly powerful when solving differential equations, as it allows us to transform each term individually. Consequently, differential equations involving sums and differences of various functions become straightforward algebraic equations in the Laplace domain.
