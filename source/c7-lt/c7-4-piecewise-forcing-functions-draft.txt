<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Piecewise Forcing Functions </title> 

	<introduction>

		<p>
			Many physical systems don't behave smoothly—they often experience sudden changes. Think of a heater clicking on, traffic lights shifting from red to green, or the jolt you feel when force is suddenly applied to an object. In mathematics, these abrupt transitions are elegantly captured by <em>piecewise functions</em>, functions that follow different rules over different intervals of time.
		</p>

		<p>
			When modeling such situations with differential equations, piecewise functions typically appear on the right-hand side, acting as inputs or forcing functions that switch behavior at specific moments. Consider, for instance, an electrical circuit whose current <m>i(t)</m> changes its driving voltage at predetermined intervals. This scenario might be described by an equation like:
			<me>
				\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2i(t)
				= \left\{
				\begin{array}{ll}
					1,	\amp 0 \le t \lt 2\\
					-1,	\amp 2 \le t \lt 4\\
					0,	\amp t \ge 4
				\end{array} \right.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			While one could directly apply the integral definition of the Laplace transform to such piecewise functions, it's much more practical and insightful to have a structured method to handle these functions systematically. The key to this is introducing the <em>unit step function</em>, a simple yet powerful mathematical tool that allows us to rewrite complex piecewise behavior in a single, concise formula.
		</p>

		<p>
			The unit step function acts as a convenient ON-OFF switch, making it straightforward to represent functions that suddenly start, stop, or shift behavior at specific points in time. By mastering this technique, you'll easily manage functions that activate only for limited intervals, switch directions, or model impulses precisely.
		</p>

		 <p>
			Throughout this section, you'll learn how to rewrite piecewise functions clearly using step functions, how to express functions that switch on and off, and how to capture intricate behaviors within a single, unified mathematical expression. These skills will set the foundation for solving equations with piecewise-defined forcing functions using Laplace transforms.

				At first glance, piecewise functions might seem complicated due to their segmented nature—each "piece" is defined differently on distinct intervals.

				Before the Laplace transform can be applied to such a function, it first needs to be deconstructed it as the sum of terms where only one of the pieces is active over its corresponding time interval. Visually, this sum would be broken up as in <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-pieces"/>.

		<subsubsection><title> The Unit Step Function </title>

			<p>
				Previously, we saw that we can control when a function turns ON or OFF by multiplying it by a simple piecewise switch. These switches are actually a special type of function known as the <em>unit step function</em>
				<fn>Also called the <em>Heaviside function</em>.</fn>. Think of it as a mathematical ON-switch that flips from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> at a specific point in time.
			</p>

			<note><title> Saying that a Function is ON or OFF </title>
				<p>
					Throughout this section, we will often use the analogy of a function being ON or OFF. To clarify, when we say 
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>
								A unit step function is ON or OFF, we mean it is equal to <m>1</m> or <m>0</m>, respectively.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A function is ON or OFF, we mean that it is multiplied by <m>1</m> or <m>0</m>, respectively. 
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</note>

			<p>
				The standard unit step function is denoted <m>u(t)</m>, and is defined as:
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="unit-step-function"><title> Unit Step Function </title>
				<statement>
					<sidebyside widths="50% 7% 36% 7%" valign="middle">
						<p>
							The <em>unit step function</em> <m>u(t)</m> is defined as:
							<me>
								u(t) = \left\{
								\begin{array}{ll}
									1, \amp t \ge 0 \\
									0, \amp \text{otherwise}
								\end{array}
								\right.
							</me>
							It flips from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> at <m>t = 0</m>.
						</p>
						<p/>
						<p>
							<image> removed for editing </image>
						</p>
						<p/>
					</sidebyside>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				Since <m>u(t)</m> only takes values of <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>, multiplying a function by <m>u(t)</m> acts as a simple ON-OFF switch. Before <m>t = 0</m>, it kills the function by multiplying it by <m>0</m>. After <m>t = 0</m>, it lets the function pass through.
			</p>

			<example><title> Switching ON a Parabola at <m>t = 0</m> </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Consider the functions defined by
						<me>
							g(t) = \frac{1}{5}t^2 - 1

						</me>.
						Describe the difference between <m>g(t)</m> and <m>h(t)</m> and write <m>h(t)</m> as a piecewise function.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
						The function, <m>g(t)</m>, is a parabola defined for all <m>t</m>. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Since <m>u(t) = 1</m> when <m>t \ge 0</m> and <m>0</m> otherwise, <m>h(t)</m> is the same parabola for <m>t \ge 0</m>, but  is zeroed out for <m>t \lt 0</m>. This is equivalent to the piecewise function:
					</p>

					<me>
						h(t) =
						\left\{
						\begin{array}{ll}
							0, \amp t \lt 0 \\
							\ds\frac{1}{5}t^2 - 1, \amp t \ge 0
						\end{array}
						\right.

					<p>
						The graph of <m>h(t)</m> higlights how multiplying by <m>u(t)</m> acts a switch that forces the parabola OFF until <m>t = 0</m>, where it turns ON.
					</p>
						
				</solution>

			<p>
				The unit step function is the first of several switching tools we'll use to manage functions that activate or deactivate at different times. In the next section, we'll build on this idea to shift the switch to times other than <m>t = 0</m>.

		<subsubsection><title> Shifted Unit Step Function (<em>off-on switch</em>) </title>

			<p>
				In the last section, we introduced the unit step function <m>u(t)</m>, which flips from OFF <m>(0)</m> to ON <m>(1)</m> at <m>t = 0</m>. But what if we want the function to turn ON later—say at <m>t = 2</m>, or <m>t = 5</m>, or even <m>t = -3</m>? That's where the <em>shifted</em> unit step function comes in.
			</p>

			<p>
				The shifted unit step function <m>u_c(t)</m> is simply the unit step that switches ON at <m>t = c</m> instead of <m>t = 0</m>. It is defined as:
			</p>

			<assemblage xml:id="shifted-unit-step-function"><title> Shifted Unit Step Function </title>
					<sidebyside widths="62% 4% 30% 4%" valign="top">

						<p>
							This is just like <m>u(t)</m>, but delayed by <m>c</m> units. Think of <m>u_c(t)</m> as <m>u(t)</m> shifted to the right if <m>c</m> is positive, or to the left if <m>c</m> is negative.
						</p>
					</note>
				</p>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				Just like before, multiplying a function by <m>u_c(t)</m> turns it ON at <m>t = c</m>. Before <m>t = c</m>, the function is OFF (multiplied by <m>0</m>). After <m>t = c</m>, the function behaves normally.
			</p>

			<example><title> Multiplying a Function by <m>u_c(t)</m> </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Consider multiplying the parabola <m>\frac{1}{5}t^2 - 1</m> by two different shifted unit step functions:
						<me>
							\left(\frac{1}{5}t^2 - 1\right) u_2(t), \qquad \left(\frac{1}{5}t^2 - 1\right) u_{-1}(t)
						</me>.
						Describe the ON/OFF behavior of the parabola in each case. Then explore how changing the shifting constant <m>c</m> affects the graph in the interactive tool that follows.
					</p>

					<p>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Multiplying the parabola by <m>u_2(t)</m> forces it OFF before <m>t = 2</m>, and ON after <m>t = 2</m>. Whereas, multiplying by <m>u_{-1}(t)</m> forces it OFF before <m>t = -1</m>, and ON after <m>t = -1</m>.
							</p>
							<p>
								To see this, drag the value of <m>c</m> to both <m>2</m> and <m>-1</m> in the interactive tool below.

			<p>
				The pattern is now clear: if you want a function to activate at <m>t = c</m>, just multiply it by <m>u_c(t)</m>. This switch-like behavior will be extremely useful when rewriting piecewise functions in a single formula.

		<subsubsection><title> Reversed Unit Step Function (<em>on-off switch</em>)  </title>

			<p>
				So far, we've used <m>u_c(t)</m> to switch functions ON at <m>t = c</m>. But what if we want the opposite—a switch that turns a function OFF at <m>t = c</m>? For example, a machine that is running initially and shuts off at a certain moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				This reverse behavior can be built using the unit step function itself. Since <m>u_c(t)</m> jumps from 0 to 1 at <m>t = c</m>, we can reverse the switch by subtracting <m>u_c(t)</m> from <m>1</m>. That is:
				<me>
					1 - u_c(t)
				</me>
				turns from ON (<m>1</m>) to OFF (<m>0</m>) at <m>t = c</m>.

				With both <m>u_c(t)</m> and <m>1 - u_c(t)</m> in hand, you can now switch functions ON or OFF exactly when you need. Next, we will cover the last switch that turns ON functions for a limited window of time—over a finite interval.

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Finite Unit Step Function (<em>off-on-off switch</em>) </title>

			<p>
				We've seen how to turn a function ON at a certain time using <m>u_c(t)</m>, and how to turn it OFF using <m>1 - u_c(t)</m>. Now let's combine those ideas to create a switch that turns a function ON for a limited interval of time—say, from <m>t = c</m> to <m>t = d</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, you might want a force to activate briefly, or a signal to pulse on for a few seconds. This calls for a function that is:
				<me>
					\left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						1, \amp c \le t \lt d \\
						0, \amp \text{otherwise}
					\end{array}
					\right.
				</me>
				This type of function acts like a window—it's OFF before <m>t = c</m>, ON during the interval <m>[c, d)</m>, and OFF again at <m>t = d</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can build this behavior by subtracting two step functions:
				<ul>
					<li><m>u_c(t)</m> turns ON at <m>t = c</m>.</li>
					<li><m>u_d(t)</m> turns ON at <m>t = d</m>, flipping us back to OFF since we are subtracting.</li>
				</ul>
				So the difference <m>u_c(t) - u_d(t)</m> is the ON-window we need.

				The finite unit step function is the final piece of the puzzle. It lets us precisely control when a function is active—and for how long. In the next section, we'll combine all these ideas to rewrite entire piecewise functions using unit step notation.
			</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Unit Step Form of a Piecewise Function </title>
			<p>
				Everything we've done so far has built up to this moment. We now have the tools to rewrite <em>any</em> piecewise-defined function as a single formula using unit step functions. This form is not only compact—it also makes Laplace transforms much easier.
			</p>

			<p>
				To remind you where we started, here's a function (with its <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function" text="custom">graph</xref>) we looked at earlier:
				<me>
					g(t) = \left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						\B \sin t,    \amp t \lt 0 \\
						\G 2e^{-t},   \amp 0 \le t \lt 2 \\
						\OR 1.5,       \amp t \ge 2.
					\end{array}
					\right.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's walk through each piece:
				<ul>
				<li>
					<xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-piece1" text="custom">Piece 1</xref>:
					<m>\B\ \sin t</m> is active before <m>t = 0</m>, so we multiply it by <m>1 - u_0(t)</m>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-piece2" text="custom">Piece 2</xref>:
					<m>\G\ 2e^{-t}</m> is active between <m>t = 0</m> and <m>t = 2</m>, so we multiply it by <m>u_0(t) - u_2(t)</m>.
				</li>
				<li>
					<xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-piece3" text="custom">Piece 3</xref>:
					<m>\OR\ 1.5</m> turns ON at <m>t = 2</m> and stays on, so we multiply it by <m>u_2(t)</m>.
				</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				Our goal is to represent <m>g(t)</m> as a sum of terms like <m>f(t)\, u_c(t)</m>, each “activating” its piece over the correct interval.
			</p>

			<p>
				Putting these all together:
				<me>
					g(t) = 
					{\B \sin t}\, \left(1 - u_0(t)\right) +
					{\G 2e^{-t}}\, \left(u_0(t) - u_2(t)\right) +
					{\OR 1.5}\, u_2(t)
				</me>

				<p>
					Then write the function as:

			</p>

	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> The Laplace Transform Method Involving Piecewise Forcing Functions </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				It is important to remember that our goal is to be able to solve a differential equation with a piecewise forcing function, such as
			</p>
			
			<me>
				y'' + y = 
				\left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						\B 3, 		\amp 0 \ge t \lt 2 \\
						\G 1,		\amp 2 \ge t \lt 4 \\
						\R t - 4,	\amp t \ge 4.
					\end{array}
				\right.
			</me>

			<p>
				Applying the Laplace transform method requires us to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the equation. However, the right-hand is mixture of constants and functions and it is not clear how to take the Laplace transform of it. Fortunately, unit step functions can help us out.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				To see this, update the equation with the piecewise function in unit step form, like so
				<me>
					y'' + y 
					= {\B 3}\big( u_0(t) - u_2(t) \big)
					+ {\G 1}\big( u_2(t) - u_4(t) \big)
					+ {\R (t - 4)}\ u_4(t)
				</me>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Regrouping the terms by their unit step functions gives the simplified equation
				<me>
					y'' + y = 3\ u_0(t) - 2\ u_2(t) + (t - 5)\ u_4(t)
				</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, we apply the Laplace transform to both sides, which leads to
				<me>
					\lap{y''} + \lap{y} = 3\ \lap{u_0(t)} - 2\ \lap{u_2(t)} + \lap{(t - 5)\ u_4(t)}
				</me>.
				On the left-hand side, the standard rules for <m>\lap{y''}</m> and <m>\lap{y}</m> apply. But, the terms on the right don't match anything in our Laplace tables yet. So before we can proceed solving these equations, we need to establish the following new transforms:
				<ol>
					<li><m>u_c(t)</m>, the shifted step function by itself,</li>
					<li><m>f(t)\, u_c(t)</m>, a function that “starts late” at <m>t = c</m>.</li>
				</ol> 
			</p>
			
			<p>
				In this subsection, we'll derive the formulas for both <m>\lap{u_c(t)}</m> and <m>\lap{f(t)\,u_c(t)}</m>, which give us the final tool needed to start solving differential equations with piecewise forcing functions. 
			</p>
			
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> Laplace Transform of <m>u_c(t)</m> </title>
			<p>
				With our new ability to express piecewise functions using unit step notation, we now need to figure out how to take their Laplace transforms. Let's start with the most basic case: what is the Laplace transform of a single shifted step function, <m>u_c(t)</m>?
			</p>
		
			<assemblage xml:id="laplace-of-step"><title> Laplace Transform of the shifted Step </title>
				<p>
					The Laplace transform of the shifted unit step function is
					<me>
						\lap{u_c(t)} = \frac{e^{-cs}}{s}.
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					<theorem><title> <m>\rightarrow \lap{u_c(t)}</m> </title>
						<p>
							To derive this, recall the definition of the Laplace transform:
							<me>
								\lap{u_c(t)} = \int_0^{\infty} u_c(t) \, e^{-st} \, dt.
							</me>
							But remember that
							<me>
								u_c(t) = \left\{
								\begin{array}{ll}
								0, \amp t \lt c\\
								1, \amp t \ge c
								\end{array}
								\right.
							</me>
							So the integrand is zero for <m>t \lt c</m>, and equal to <m>e^{-st}</m> for <m>t \ge c</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							That simplifies our integral to just the portion from <m>t = c</m> to infinity:

						<p>
							To compute the integral, we have to remember that this is an improper integral, so we re-express it as a limit

						</p>
						
						<p>
							Now, we compute the limit of this expression as <m>b \to \infty</m>:
							<me>
								\lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{e^{-sc}}{s} - \frac{e^{-sb}}{s} \right)

							As before, the <term>limit of the exponential function</term> converges if its power, <m>-sb</m>, goes to <m>-\infty</m>. This happens if <m>s \gt 0</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							So, as long as <m>s \gt 0</m>, then <m>\lim_{b \to \infty} e^{-sb} = 0</m> and the transform becomes

				This is a powerful insight: in the Laplace domain, a delayed switch becomes a simple exponential function. You'll see this pattern appear again and again as we take transforms of more complex step-based expressions.

				Next, we'll take this one step further and look at how to compute the Laplace transform of a function that's turned ON at <m>t = c</m>—that is, expressions like <m>f(t)\cdot u_c(t)</m>.

				<me>
					\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)}?
				</me>
				This is the most common form you'll encounter when working with piecewise forcing functions.

							Let's break this down. By definition:
							<me>
								\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)} = \int_0^\infty f(t)\, u_c(t)\, e^{-st}\, dt.

						<p>
							This new integral looks a lot like the Laplace transform of <m>f(t)</m>, but it starts at <m>t = c</m> instead of <m>t = 0</m>. Luckily, we can use a simple <m>u</m>-substitution to create a new variable that starts at <m>t = 0</m>.

				Regardless of how many pieces a piecewise function has, the process is always the same and can be summarized as follows:
			</p>

			<assemblage xml:id="piecewise-laplace-summary"><title> Summary: Laplace Transforms of Piecewise Functions </title>
				<p>
				To compute <m>\lap{g(t)}</m> for a piecewise function:
				<ol>
					<li>Rewrite the function using step functions for each interval.</li>
					<li>Group and simplify terms with matching <m>u_c(t)</m> factors.</li>
					<li>Apply the shift rule: <m>\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)} = e^{-cs} \lap{f(t + c)}</m>.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				This method works for any piecewise forcing function and now you're ready to use it to solve full differential equations using Laplace transforms.
			</p>
		
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Solving Equations with Piecewise Forcing Functions </title>	
			<p>
				We've reached our goal: solving differential equations with piecewise forcing functions using the Laplace transform. Let's now walk through how everything fits together in practice.
			</p>

			<p>
				Suppose we are given the equation:
				<me>
					y'' + y = \left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						3,       \amp 0 \le t \lt 2 \\
						1,       \amp 2 \le t \lt 4 \\
						t - 4,   \amp t \ge 4
					\end{array}
					\right.
				</me>
				with initial conditions, <m>y(0) = 0</m> and <m>y'(0) = 0</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The first step is to rewrite the right-hand side in terms of unit step functions. This function has three active intervals, so we break it up accordingly:
				<ul>
					<li><m>3</m> is ON from <m>t = 0</m> to <m>t = 2</m>: <m>u_0(t) - u_2(t)</m></li>
					<li><m>1</m> is ON from <m>t = 2</m> to <m>t = 4</m>: <m>u_2(t) - u_4(t)</m></li>
					<li><m>t - 4</m> is ON starting at <m>t = 4</m>: <m>u_4(t)</m></li>
				</ul>

				So the forcing function becomes:
				<me>
					g(t) = 3\cdot\left(u_0(t) - u_2(t)\right) + 1\cdot\left(u_2(t) - u_4(t)\right) + (t - 4)\cdot u_4(t)
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				We now take the Laplace transform of both sides. Using the fact that <m>y'' + y</m> transforms to <m>s^2 Y(s) + Y(s)</m> (because <m>y(0) = y'(0) = 0</m>), we get:
				<me>
					s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) = \lap{g(t)}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now apply the shift rule to each piece of <m>g(t)</m>:
				<ul>
					<li><m>\lap{3(u_0 - u_2)} = 3\left( \frac{1}{s} - \frac{e^{-2s}}{s} \right)</m></li>
					<li><m>\lap{(u_2 - u_4)} = \frac{e^{-2s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-4s}}{s}</m></li>
					<li><m>\lap{(t - 4) \cdot u_4(t)} = e^{-4s} \cdot \lap{t} = e^{-4s} \cdot \frac{1}{s^2}</m></li>
				</ul>

				Combine all terms:
				<md>
					<mrow>
						s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) \amp = \frac{3}{s} - \frac{3e^{-2s}}{s} + \frac{e^{-2s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-4s}}{s} + \frac{e^{-4s}}{s^2}
					</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Group and simplify:
				<me>
					s^2 Y(s) + Y(s) 
					= \frac{3}{s} - \frac{2e^{-2s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-4s}}{s} + \frac{e^{-4s}}{s^2}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Factor <m>Y(s)</m> on the left:
				<me>
					Y(s)(s^2 + 1) 
					= \frac{3}{s} - \frac{2e^{-2s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-4s}}{s} + \frac{e^{-4s}}{s^2}
				</me>

				So:
				<me>
					Y(s) 
					= \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \left( \frac{3}{s} - \frac{2e^{-2s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-4s}}{s} + \frac{e^{-4s}}{s^2} \right)
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find <m>y(t)</m>, take the inverse Laplace transform of each term. This may involve partial fractions, but the key idea is that:
				<ul>
					<li>You now have a complete expression for <m>Y(s)</m></li>
					<li>All the Laplace rules apply—even with exponentials!</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				This approach works for any piecewise-defined forcing function—no matter how many intervals or expressions. The process is systematic:

					<li>Rewrite the forcing function using unit step functions.</li>
					<li>Apply the Laplace transform to both sides.</li>
					<li>Solve algebraically for <m>Y(s)</m>.</li>
					<li>Invert to find <m>y(t)</m>.</li>
				</ol>

			<example><title> A 4-Part Piecewise Forcing Function </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Solve the following differential equation:
						<me>
							\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 4\frac{dy}{dt}
							= \left\{
							\begin{array}{cl}
								2,	\amp 0 \le t \lt 1 \\
								-t,	\amp 1 \le t \lt 3 \\
								0,	\amp 3 \le t \lt 4 \\
								-1,	\amp t \ge 4
							\end{array}
							\right.
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
				<solution><title> <m>\rightarrow</m> Find <m>y(t)</m> </title>
					<p>
						We begin by identifying the needed unit step functions.
						<me>
							g(t) =  \cdot
							\left\{
								\begin{array}{lll}
									e^{-t}, \amp t \lt 1 \quad \leftarrow (-\infty, 1): \amp 1-u_{1}(t)\\
									3,		\amp t \ge 1 \quad \leftarrow (1, \infty):	\amp u_{1}(t).
								\end{array}
							\right.
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Then we can write <m>g(t)</m> as
						<me>
							g(t) = e^{-t} \cdot \left(1 - u_{1}(t)\right) + 3 \cdot u_{1}(t).
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Combining like unit step function terms, we get
						<md>
							<mrow> 
								g(t) \amp

							</mrow>
							<mrow>
								\amp 
								= e^{-t} + \left(-e^{-t} + 3\right) \cdot u_{1}(t)

						and taking the Laplace transform of the last two terms separately.
						<me>
							\lap{g(t)}

	<conclusion>
		<p>
			In this section, you've built a complete toolkit for handling piecewise forcing functions with the Laplace transform. You learned how to rewrite piecewise functions using unit step notation, apply transformation rules to handle delays and windows, and ultimately solve differential equations with these inputs. This framework opens the door to modeling real-world systems with abrupt changes—switches, shocks, pulses, and more.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the next section, we'll take these ideas even further, applying them to systems that include impulses, discontinuities, and other non-smooth behaviors. The Laplace method is just getting started.
