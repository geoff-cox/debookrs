	<title> Derivative Transfer via Integration by Parts </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Before we apply the Laplace transform to solve differential equations, we need to understand the foundational concept that makes the method work: transferring derivatives inside an integral. This section begins with a review of integration by parts, focusing on how derivatives applied to one function can be shifted onto another. You'll see how this principle leads directly to the structure of the Laplace transform.

		<title> Review of Integration by Parts </title>

		<p>
			To understand how the Laplace transform method simplifies differential equations into algebraic equations, we must revisit integration by parts from calculus. The minimalistic version of the formula is:
			<me>
				\int u\,dv = uv - \int v\,du
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			If <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m> on <m>[a,b]</m>, then we can write a more detailed version that makes the transfer of derivatives clear:
			<me>
				\int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }v}}{
				\us{u}{ \us{\uparrow}{\ul{ 
					u(t)
				}}} \ 
				\us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{
					{\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{v'\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}(t)} dt
				}}}
				}
				= \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ u(t) }}}\ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ v(t) }}} \Big|_{a}^{b}
				- \int_{a}^{b} \os{{\color{RoyalBlue}\large\text{derivative on }u}}{
					\us{v}{ \us{\uparrow}{\ul{ v(t) }}} \ 
					\us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{ {\color{RoyalBlue}\os{\downarrow}{u'\vphantom{\Large\Gamma}}(t)} dt }}}
				}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This version shows how integration by parts lets you shift a derivative from one function to another inside an integral. That becomes especially useful when <m>u(t) = e^{-st}</m> for some constant <m>s</m>.

			Let's try this with a specific example. Suppose <m>u(t) = e^{-st}</m> and <m>v(t) = y(t)</m>. Then <m>u'(t) = -se^{-st}</m> and <m>v'(t) = y'(t)</m>, so the formula becomes:

			We can now make two important observations. First, the left-hand side, which originally had a derivative on <m>y</m>, has been rewritten with no derivatives of <m>y</m> at all. Second, the only other difference between the two integrals is a factor of <m>s</m>. In a sense, <m>s</m> represents the derivative that once was on <m>y</m>.
