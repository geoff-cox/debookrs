Section 2: The Laplace Domain

	This section covers the Laplace domain, focusing on the transformation process of differential equations into the Laplace domain and back to the time domain.

	Overall Story this Section wants to tell:
		* This section is centered around a 4-step roadmap for the Laplace transform method, which includes:
			1. Forward Transform into the Laplace Domain
				- This step involves the transformation of a differential equation into the "Laplace Equation" within the Laplace domain.
				- Our differential equation becomes the "Laplace Equation".
				- Variable change: differential equation t → Laplace equation s.
				- Unknown function change: y(t) → Y(s).
			2. Solving the Laplace Equation for Y(s)
				- This step solves the "Laplace Equation" for Y(s).
				- We refer to Y(s) as the "Laplace Solution".
			3. Preparing the Laplace Solution, Y(s), for the Backward Transform
				- This step prepares the "Laplace Solution" for the inverse transform.
				- This step is the most challenging part of the process, requiring algebraic techniques such as partial fraction decomposition and completing the square.
				- The goal is to rewrite the terms of the Laplace Solution so that they match the right column of the Laplace transform table.
			4. Backward Transform into the Standard Domain
				- This step involves applying the inverse Laplace transform to the "Laplace Solution" to revert back to the original differential equation.
				- The result is the solution to the original differential equation in the time domain.
				- Variable change: Laplace equation s → differential equation t.
				- Unknown function change: Y(s) → y(t).

	The section is divided into three subsections:
		1.	Into the Laplace Domain (Forward Transform)
			- This subsection covers step 1 of the Laplace Transform Method. That is, the transformation of a differential equation into the "Laplace Equation" (transformed equation in s) within the Laplace domain.
		2.	Out of the Laplace Domain (Backward Transform)
			- This subsection covers step 4 of the Laplace Transform Method. That is, the transformation of the "Laplace Equation" (in s) back into the original differential equation (in t).
			- We skip from step 1 to step 4 because the backward transforms naturally follow from the table of forward transforms. Additionally, knowing the forms we are trying to match to get the inverse transforms motivates the preparation of the Laplace Solution in step 3.
		3.	Within the Laplace Domain
			- This subsection covers steps 2 and 3 of the Laplace Transform Method. That is, isolating Y(S) in the "Laplace Equation" to get the Laplace Solution (step 2) and preparing this solution for the backward transform (step 3).
			- Since step 2 is straightforward, we integrate it into the discussion of step 3.
			- The main focus of this subsection is to cover the standard techniques used to rewrite the terms of the Laplace Solution so that they match the right column of the Laplace transform table. This includes a review of partial fraction decomposition and completing the square.

	<introduction>

		<p>
			When solving differential equations using the Laplace transform method, our goal is to transport our equation into the Laplace domain. Once there, the derivatives of <m>y</m> are moved onto an exponential function, leaving <m>y</m> (without its derivatives) temporarily "encased" inside a Laplace transform, <m>Y</m>. This creates an algebra equation where <m>Y</m> is our new unknown, which we isolate. Once isolated, we "revert" the equation back into our original domain, revealing the solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			This section clearly outlines the four main steps involved in the transformation process, illustrated in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="title"/>. We'll consistently use the model equation
			<me>
				y'' - 9y = 10e^{2t}
			</me>
			to demonstrate each step, reinforcing how the Laplace transform systematically incorporates initial conditions and simplifies complex differential equations into algebraic problems.
		</p>

		<p>
			Applying the forward Laplace transform to a differential equation involves converting both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation into their Laplace-transformed counterparts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Applying the Laplace transform method to a differential equation starts by transforming this equation into a new equation where the derivatives are replaced by algebraic expressions. To recover to the solution to the original equation the transformation must also be reversed. This process, which we will refer to as a <q>backwards transform</q>, corresponds to step 3 on the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace transform roadmap</xref>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just as the forward Laplace transform simplifies a differential equation by converting it into an algebraic one, the backward transform completes the cycle by converting the algebraic solution back into its original form. This chapter will focus on the techniques used to perform the inverse Laplace transform, guiding you through the steps needed to move from the transformed function, <m>F(s)</m>, back to the original function, <m>f(t)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will explore key methods, such as partial fraction decomposition and the use of Laplace transform tables, to help simplify complex transformed functions. Additionally, we will highlight common challenges and how to overcome them, ensuring a smooth transition back to the original domain.

		<p>
			Although using the table of Laplace transforms makes this step straightforward, understanding what's happening behind the scenes is crucial.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recall that applying the Laplace transform to an equation is equivalent to multiplying the equation by <m>e^{-st}</m> and integrating with respect to <m>t</m>.
			<me>
				\ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} (y'') dt}_{\large\lap{y''}} 
				- \ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} (9y) dt}_{\large\lap{9y}}
				= \ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \left( 10e^{2t} \right) dt}_{\large\lap{10e^{2t}}}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Applying integration by parts twice to the first integral, and evaluating the improper integral on the right-hand side, gives us

		<me>
			-sy(0) - y'(0) + s^2\ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} (y) dt}_{\large\lap{y} = Y} 
			- 9\ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} (y) dt}_{\large\lap{y} = Y}
			= \frac{10}{s - 2}
		</me>

		<p>
			To simplify further, we set <m>\lap{y} = Y</m>. We can also plug in the initial conditions <m>y(0) = 1</m> and <m>y'(0) = -7</m>, giving us
		</p>
		
		<me>
			s^2Y - 9Y - s + 7 = \frac{10}{s - 2}
		</me>.

		<p>
			Notice how we've turned the problem into an algebraic equation involving the variable <m>Y</m>. Solving for <m>Y</m> actually means solving for the original unknown <m>y</m>, which is neatly encapsulated inside <m>Y</m>!

	<subsection><title> Out of the Laplace Domain (Backward Transform) </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				As we have discussed, the first step of the Laplace Transform Method involves a <xref ref="lt-roadmap-step-1" text="custom">forward transformation</xref>, which converts the <m>y(t)</m>-equation into an equation containing <m>Y(S)</m> and <m>s</m>. Now, we skip ahead to the final step of the method, where we reverse this process to return to the <m>y(t)</m>-equation, revealing the solution to the original differential equation (<xref ref="lt-roadmap-step-4-fig"/>).
			</p>

			<figure xml:id="lt-roadmap-step-4-fig">
				<caption>
					To leave the Laplace domain (step 4), we apply a backward transform (<m>\laplacesym^{-1}</m>) to the Laplace solution for <m>Y</m>.
				</caption>
				<image source="figures/LT-Roadmap-step-4.png" width="100%"/>
			</figure>

		</introduction>

		<p>
			Leaving the Laplace domain requires a reversal of the forward transformation performed in step 1. This is accomplished by applying the inverse Laplace transform, denoted <m>\laplacesym^{-1}</m>, to both sides of a Laplace equation. For example, if the Laplace equation is
			<me>
				Y(s) = \frac{1}{s + 3}
			</me>
			then applying the inverse Laplace transform to both sides gives
			<men xml:id="backward-transform-simple-eqn">
				\ilap{Y(s)} = \ilap{\frac{1}{s + 3}}
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since <m>Y(s) = \lap{f(t)}</m> and by <xref ref="L2" text="custom"><m>L_2</m> (with <m>a=3</m>)</xref>, <xref ref="backward-transform-simple-eqn"/> becomes
			<me>
				\ilap{\lap{f(t)}} = \ilap{\lap{e^{3t}}}
			</me>
			and the inverses cancel, leaving us with
			<me>
				y(t) = e^{-3t}
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This example highlights that knowing the forward transform of a function actually gives you the inverse transform as well. This means that the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table of Laplace transforms</xref> is used to find both the forward and backward tranforms. The main difference being that the backward transforms are found by first matching the functions on the right column of the table. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's look at an example to get some practice with this.

		</example>

		<p>
			These examples demonstrate how to find the inverse Laplace Transform when the <m>s</m>-function matches a form on the right side of the common transforms table. However, not all functions will align perfectly with the table, and additional adjustments are needed to match the forms. In the next discussion, we will explore how to modify the <m>s</m>-function to match the common forms in the table.
		</p>

		<p>
			As you can see in the table, the differences between the functions in the right column are more subtle than those on the left. The trick is to identify the structure of the denominators, as the next example demonstrates.
		</p>


		<p>
			When working with Laplace transforms, it's common to encounter algebraic expressions that don't perfectly match the standard forms we use for the inverse Laplace transform. In these cases, we need to manipulate the expression to make it fit one of the known forms.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, consider the expression:
			<me> \frac{1}{s^2 + 25} \qquad \leftarrow \ \text{looks like} \quad \frac{b}{s^2 + b^2}. </me>
			While it's not an exact match, we can observe from the denominator that <m>b = 5.</m>
		</p>

		<p>
			However, the numerator doesn't match yet. To correct this, we need a 5 in the numerator. We can't just multiply the numerator by 5 without changing the value, so instead, we multiply the entire expression by <m>\ds\frac{5}{5}</m>, which is equivalent to multiplying by 1:
			<md>
				<mrow>\frac{1}{s^2 + 25} 	\amp = \frac{1}{s^2 + 5^2} </mrow>
				<mrow>						\amp = \frac{5}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{s^2 + 5^2} </mrow>
				<mrow>						\amp = \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{s^2 + 5^2} \quad \us{\text{match}}{\os{\text{perfect}}{\leftarrow}}\ \frac{b}{s^2 + b^2}</mrow>
			</md>
			Multiplying by <m>\ds\frac{5}{5}</m> doesn't change the value of the expression, but it allows us to match the standard form.
		</p>

		<p>
			One of the most common adjustments is introducing a missing constant in the numerator, as we did earlier. By multiplying both the numerator and denominator by this constant, we maintain the expression's value while transforming it into a recognizable form. Let's look at some examples:
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we've solved for <m>Y(s)</m> and shaped it into table-friendly pieces, we're ready for the final step of the Laplace Transform Method: returning to the time domain. This is where the inverse Laplace transform comes into play.
		</p>

		<p>
			The inverse Laplace transform undoes the work of the forward transform. It takes each piece of <m>Y(s)</m> and maps it back to a function of <m>t</m>. This step completes the journey: we began with a differential equation in <m>t</m>, transformed it into a Laplace equation in <m>s</m>, and now return to the time-domain solution <m>y(t)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The key to making this possible is the Laplace transform table, which pairs common expressions in <m>s</m> with their time-domain counterparts. For example, the table tells us that:
			<me>
				\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ \frac{1}{s - a} \right\} = e^{at}
			</me>
			and
			<me>
				\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ \frac{s}{s^2 + b^2} \right\} = \cos(bt)
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			But what if <m>Y(s)</m> is made up of several terms? That's where one of the most useful properties of the Laplace transform comes in: <strong>linearity</strong>. The inverse transform is linear, which means we can apply it term by term:
			<me>
				\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ A(s) + B(s) \right\} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ A(s) \right\} + \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{ B(s) \right\}
			</me>
			This is why we spend so much time preparing <m>Y(s)</m>: once each piece matches something from the table, linearity lets us invert each one individually.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this step, pattern recognition is everything. Once you've isolated and matched each part of <m>Y(s)</m>, the inverse transform becomes a simple lookup task. All the real work happened earlier—in solving and preparing the Laplace solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's walk through a [placeholder for example] to see how these patterns unfold and how linearity allows us to reassemble the final time-domain solution, piece by piece.

	<subsection><title> Within the Laplace Domain </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Once we've transformed our equation into the Laplace domain, we've effectively converted a differential equation problem into an algebra problem. Our original differential equation in <m>t</m> has become a "Laplace Equation" in <m>s</m>, and our unknown function <m>y(t)</m> has become <m>Y(s)</m>. Now comes the next challenge: solving this new equation and preparing it for the trip back out of the Laplace domain.
			</p>

			<figure xml:id="lt-roadmap-steps-2-3">
				<caption>
					Once inside the Laplace domain, solve the Laplace equation for <m>Y</m> (step 2), then prepare the Laplace solution for a backward transform (step 3).
				</caption>
				<image source="figures/LT-Roadmap-steps-2-3.png" width="100%"/>
			</figure>

			<p>
				This subsection focuses on two closely connected steps in the Laplace Transform Method:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<term>Step 2: Solving the Laplace Equation.</term> Here, we isolate <m>Y</m> by treating the transformed equation like any other algebraic expression. Since derivatives have already been transformed, we're simply solving for the Laplace solution (a function of <m>s</m>).
				</li>
				<li>
					<term>Step 3: Preparing the Laplace Solution.</term> This is where the heart of the Laplace method lies. Even after solving for <m>Y</m>, we're not done. To apply the backward Laplace transform (Step 4), we must rewrite <m>Y</m> into a form that matches entries in the Laplace table. This step is often the most challenging part of the entire process.
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				You can think of Step 2 as getting an answer, and Step 3 as breaking the answer down into simpler pieces—ones that we can recognize in the table. That's where techniques like partial fraction decomposition, completing the square, and clever algebraic manipulation come into play.
			</p>

		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> Laplace Domain Guiding Principle </title>

			<p>
				After step 2, the Laplace solution will be a rational function of the form:
				<me>
					Y(s) = \frac{P(s)}{Q(s)}
				</me>
				where <m>P(s)</m> and <m>Q(s)</m> are polynomials. The job of step 3 is to prepare <m>Y(s)</m> for a backward transform. This means rewriting <m>Y(s)</m> into a sum of simpler functions resembling the forms in the right column of the Laplace transform table. Fortunately, rational functions have a property that ensures they can be rewritten as the sum of the following types of terms 
				<me>
					\frac{k}{s-a},\quad\frac{k}{(s-a)^n},\quad\frac{k}{as^2 + bs + c},\quad\frac{ks}{as^2 + bs + c}
				</me>
				where <m>a, b, c,</m> &amp; <m>k</m> are constants and <m>as^2 + bs + c</m> is irreducible.
				<fn>
					<p>
						A quadratic polynomial <m>as^2 + bs + c</m> is irreducible if it cannot be factored as the product of two linear factors with real coefficients.
					</p>

					<p>
						For example, <m>s^2 + 1</m> is irreducible because it factors as <m>(s+i)(s-i)</m>, but <m>i</m> is not a real number.
					</p>
						
					<p>
						A quadratic is irreducible if its discriminant, <m>b^2 - 4ac</m>, is negative.
					</p>
				</fn>
				The process by which this is done is called <term>partial fraction decomposition (PFD)</term>.
			</p>

			<p>
				As we work through the rest of this section, we will assume the Laplace solution, <m>Y(s)</m>, has been found (step 2) and explore hypothetical situations for how to prepare <m>Y(s)</m> (step 3) for the final backward transformation (step 4) which leads to the solution. Each situation will introduce a new complication and a strategy for overcoming it.   
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Situation 1 - Straightforward PFD </title>

			<p>
				For the first situation, suppose we completed steps 1 and 2 to find the Laplace solution is given by the rational function
				<me>
					Y(s) = \frac{2s+5}{s^2+5s+4}
				</me>.
				Since the denominator can be factored as <m>(s+1)(s+4)</m>, partial fraction decomposition guarantees that this rational function can be written as
				<me>
					\frac{2s+5}{(s+1)(s+4)} = \frac{A}{s+1} + \frac{B}{s+4}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find the constants <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we multiply both sides by the common denominator, <m>(s+1)(s+4)</m>, to eliminate all the fractions and leaving us with
				<me>
					2s + 5 = A(s + 4) + B(s + 1)
				</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Strategically selecting <m>s</m> as <m>-1</m> and <m>-4</m> leads directly to the values of <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.

			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Splitting Fractions </title>

			<p>
				One of the simplest, yet most powerful, techniques for preparing a Laplace solution is <em>splitting fractions</em>. This comes into play when the denominator of a term in <m>Y(s)</m> already matches a standard form from the Laplace transform table, but the numerator is a sum or difference of terms.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, suppose we've solved for <m>Y(s)</m> and ended up with a term like:
				<me>
					\frac{s + 2}{s^2 + 4}
				</me>
				Looking at the Laplace table, you might recognize <m>\frac{s}{s^2 + 4}</m> as the transform of <m>\cos(2t)</m>, and <m>\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}</m> as the transform of <m>\sin(2t)</m>. But to take advantage of that observation, we need to separate this term as
				<me>
					\frac{s}{s^2 + 4} + \frac{2}{s^2 + 4}
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				This is what we mean by “splitting fractions”—we break up the numerator so that each term individually aligns with an entry in the Laplace transform table. The denominator stays the same, and the process is just reversing the addition of fractions with a common denominator.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's work through a [placeholder for example] where we encounter a Laplace Solution that looks too complex to invert at first glance, but becomes straightforward after splitting.
			</p>
			
			<example><title> Backward Transform - Splitting Fractions </title>
				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Suppose <m>Y(s)</m> are the Laplace solutions found from step 2. Rewrite <m>Y(s)</m> so that its terms match the forms in the right column of the <xref ref="lt-table-L1-L12" text="custom">Laplace transform table</xref>. Then proceed to step 4 and give the solution. 
						</p>
						<p>
							<me>
								Y(s) = \frac{2s - 3}{s^2 + 16} \quad\text{and}\quad Y(s) = \frac{s^3 - 7}{s^7}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<p>
					<solution>
						<p>
							Noticing the form <m>s^2 + b^2</m> in the denominator, we split the fraction as follows:
							<me>
								Y(s) = \frac{2s - 3}{s^2 + 16} 
								= \ub{\frac{2s}{s^2 + 16}}_{\large\text{1️⃣}}
								- \ub{\frac{3}{s^2 + 16}}_{\large\text{2️⃣}}
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Since 1️⃣ and 2️⃣ resemble <xref ref="lt-table-row-L5" text="title"/> and <xref ref="lt-table-row-L4" text="title"/> (with <m>b=4</m>), respectively, we further update these terms as
						</p>
					
						<me>
							Y(s) = 2\frac{s}{s^2 + 16} - \frac34\frac{4}{s^2 + 16}
						</me>
					
						<p>
							and apply the inverse Laplace transform,
						</p>
						
						<me>
							\ilap{Y(s)} = 2\ilap{\frac{s}{s^2 + 16}} - \frac34\ilap{\frac{4}{s^2 + 16}}
						</me>
						
						<p>
							to get the solution
						</p>
						
						<me>
							y(t) = 2 \cos(4t) - \frac{3}{4} \sin(4t).
						</me>

					</solution>
					<solution>
						<p>
							Since the denominator of <m>Y</m> already matches the denominator in <xref ref="lt-table-row-L3" text="title"/>, we split the fraction as
							<me>
								Y(s) = \frac{s^3 - 7}{s^7} = \frac{s^3}{s^7} - \frac{7}{s^7} = \frac{1}{s^4} - \frac{7}{s^7} = \frac{1}{3!}\frac{3!}{s^4} - \frac{7}{6!}\frac{6!}{s^7}
							</me>
							and apply the inverse Laplace transform, to get
							<md>
								<mrow>	\ilap{Y(s)}	\amp = \ilap{\frac{1}{3!}\frac{3!}{s^4} - \frac{7}{6!}\frac{6!}{s^7}}			</mrow>
								<mrow>	y(t)		\amp = \frac{1}{3!}\ilap{\frac{3!}{s^4}} - \frac{7}{6!}\ilap{\frac{6!}{s^7}}	</mrow>

							</md>

			<p>
				Always check for opportunities to split before reaching for more advanced techniques. It's often the quickest way to unlock the inverse transform.

		<subsubsection><title> Completing the Square </title>

			<p>
				Review <xref ref="review-completing-the-sqr" text="title"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you progress through the Laplace Transform Method, you will often encounter <xref ref="rational-function" text="custom">rational functions</xref> that do not immediately match any known form in the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table of Laplace transforms</xref>. For example, the function
				<me>\frac{s-1}{s^2 - 2s + 5}</me>
				does not align with standard forms. A common approach is to rewrite the denominator in the form <m>(s - a)^2 + b^2</m>, allowing it to match known transforms like <m>L_7</m> or <m>L_8</m>. This technique, called completing the square, is essential for converting quadratic expressions into forms that are easier to work with in inverse Laplace computations.
			</p>

			<p>
				Completing the square is particularly useful when the quadratic expression in the denominator has complex roots. As a quick check, recall from <xref ref="solving-the-quadratic-equation" text="custom">solving quadratic equations</xref> that if the discriminant
				<me>b^2 - 4ac</me>
				is negative, the quadratic function has complex roots. This indicates that completing the square is the correct approach, as the following examples will demonstrate.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes, the form of <m>Y(s)</m> looks close to something familiar, but not quite close enough. In particular, you might see a quadratic in the denominator—like <m>s^2 + 6s + 13</m>—and feel stuck because it doesn't match any entry in the Laplace transform table.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's where <em>completing the square</em> comes in. The Laplace table is full of expressions like:
				<me>
					\frac{s}{(s - a)^2 + b^2} \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{b}{(s - a)^2 + b^2}
				</me>
				These are the transforms of cosine and sine functions involving exponential shifts. To match them, we need the denominator to look like a perfect square plus a constant.
			</p>

			<p>
				Completing the square is a way to rewrite any quadratic into that recognizable form. For example:
				<me>
					s^2 + 6s + 13 = (s + 3)^2 + 4
				</me>
				Now that denominator is starting to look a lot like something from the Laplace table!
			</p>

			<p>
				This technique is especially important when dealing with shifted sine and cosine transforms. The key is to rewrite the denominator into a form that highlights:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>A shift in <m>s</m> — this becomes a time-domain exponential like <m>e^{-3t}</m></li>
				<li>A sum of squares — this creates sine or cosine terms in the solution</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				After completing the square, you'll often need to split the fraction or rearrange the numerator to finish the job. But the square completion is the step that unlocks the structure behind the expression.
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's look at a [placeholder for example] where completing the square reveals the form we need to apply the inverse Laplace transform.

				Completing the square is a crucial technique when working with quadratic expressions in the denominator of Laplace transforms. It allows for the backward transformations by rewriting the <m>s</m>-function in a form that aligns with known inverse Laplace transforms. In the next subsection, we will explore another technique: partial fraction decomposition, which helps break down more complex rational functions into simpler parts that can be easily matched to common inverse transforms.
			</p>

			<p>
				Whenever you see a second-degree polynomial in the denominator that isn't factored or doesn't match a known entry, your first instinct should be: can I complete the square? If the answer is yes, you're probably on the right track.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> Partial Fraction Decomposition </title>
			
			<p>
				Review <xref ref="review-rational-functions" text="title"/> and <xref ref="review-pfd" text="title"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the Laplace Transform Method, we often encounter rational functions with polynomial denominators that can be factored into simpler linear or quadratic terms. In such cases, partial fraction decomposition becomes a powerful technique. By breaking the original rational function into simpler fractions, each corresponding to a known form in the Laplace Transform Table, we can efficiently compute the inverse Laplace transform.
			</p>

			<p>
				The key idea is to express a complex rational function as a sum of simpler fractions, each with a simpler denominator. For example, if the denominator can be factored as <m>(s - a)(s - b)</m>, we can rewrite the function as:
				<me>\frac{f(s)}{(s - a)(s - b)} = \frac{A}{s - a} + \frac{B}{s - b}.</me>
				Once expressed in this way, we can directly apply the inverse Laplace transform to each term. Let's explore a series of examples to demonstrate this approach.
			</p>

			<p>
				Partial fraction decomposition also works for more complex rational functions with higher-degree polynomials in the denominator. The key is to factor the denominator as much as possible, then apply the decomposition to each term. Let's examine a more complex case involving cubic and quartic denominators.
			</p>

			<p>
				Partial fraction decomposition (PFD) is the heavyweight tool of the Laplace transform method. While techniques like splitting fractions and completing the square are elegant and quick, PFD is the go-to strategy when your Laplace solution is a single complicated rational expression—and there's no clear path to invert it.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of PFD is simple: to break a complicated rational expression into a sum of simpler terms that we can match directly with entries in the Laplace transform table. But the method itself can feel messy. There are case distinctions, algebraic manipulations, and systems of equations. Still, it's worth it—because once we decompose the expression, the backward transform becomes a breeze.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here's the general setup: we encounter a Laplace solution like
				<me>
					Y(s) = \frac{P(s)}{Q(s)}
				</me>
				where <m>P(s)</m> and <m>Q(s)</m> are polynomials and <m>\deg P(s) \lt \deg Q(s)</m>. If that's the case, we can try to rewrite this as a sum of simpler fractions, each corresponding to a known Laplace transform.
			</p>

			<p>
				Exactly how we do that depends on the structure of the denominator <m>Q(s)</m>—whether it factors into linear terms, irreducible quadratics, or a mix of both. We won't attempt to cover every rule and nuance here. Instead, we'll focus on why PFD shows up in the Laplace method and how to recognize when it's needed.
			</p>

			<p>
				You can think of partial fractions as the translation step between algebra and table lookup. The algebra gives you the messy result, and the table wants simple, isolated terms. PFD bridges that gap.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we'll work through a [placeholder for example] that walks through the process of decomposing a rational function using partial fractions and shows how each resulting term corresponds to a familiar inverse Laplace transform.

				Partial fraction decomposition simplifies complex rational functions, breaking them into manageable terms that correspond to known inverse Laplace transforms. In the next section, we will explore advanced techniques, including handling repeated roots and higher-order polynomials.
			</p>

			<p>
				Because PFD is such a central technique—not just in Laplace transforms, but in many areas of applied math—we've included a dedicated appendix that reviews the method in full detail. That review includes the general procedure, case breakdowns, and several worked examples to serve as a reference.
			</p>

			<p>
				For now, focus on spotting when PFD is needed, understanding what it accomplishes, and getting comfortable with the logic behind breaking a rational expression into simpler pieces.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				As you work through this process, pay attention not just to the mechanics but to the strategy behind each algebraic move. This is where the Laplace Transform Method feels the most like solving a puzzle. And once you've broken <m>Y(s)</m> down into table-friendly pieces, you're ready for the final step: bringing the solution back into the time domain.
