		The Laplace transform method is a powerful technique that solves a differential equation by temporarily injecting it into a new setting called the <term>Laplace domain</term>. In this domain, our original differential equation with unknown, <m>y</m> is replaced with an algebraic <term>Laplace equation</term> with unknown, <m>Y</m>. The beauty of this approach lies in the simple fact that as we isolate <m>Y</m> with algebra, we are simultaneously isolating <m>y</m>. Amazingly, once you have solved for <m>Y</m>, the process can be reversed to recover the solution, <m>y</m>, to the original equation.

		A big picture sample of this process can be visualized in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace transform roadmap</xref>. As you can see, this four-step process begins with a forward transformation of the original equation into a Laplace domain (step 1). The new Laplace equation is solved (step 2) and the Laplace solution is prepared for its trip out of the Laplace domain (step 3). The process ends with a backward transformation which leads to the solution of the original equation (step 4).

		This chapter breaks down the Laplace transform method into three sections. The first section aims to define, motivate, and build a solid collection of Laplace transform properties and rules. Then we explore details invloved in moving through each of the steps in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">roadmap</xref>. We will finish the chapter with a variety of examples that demonstrate, step-by-step, how this method is used to solve initial value problems.
