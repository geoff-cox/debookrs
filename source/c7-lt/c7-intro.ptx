		Solving algebraic equations typically involves isolating the unknown variable. However, differential equations introduce complexity because the unknown function we seek is trapped within one or more derivatives, making isolation more difficult. However, the Laplace Transform method provides a way to temporarily transfer these derivatives to another variable, opening the door to solve the equation using algebraic methods. As you will see, this powerful approach works by combining integration by parts (from calculus) with the derivative properties of exponential functions.

		As we learn the basics of this method, we will systematically follow the roadmap provided in <xref ref="lt-roadmap"/>, guiding you through each step: from the given equation in the <q>Standard Domain</q>, to the algebraic problem in the <q>Laplace Domain</q>, and finally returning back to the final solution in the original domain. By consistently referring to this roadmap, we aim to reinforce your understanding of each transformation step and the overall solving process.

		By the end of this chapter, you will not only have solved the specific initial-value problem depicted in our roadmap but also developed a reliable approach to confidently navigate your way through a similar process for any equations you may encounter.
