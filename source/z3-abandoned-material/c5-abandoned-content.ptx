		<paragraphs><title>A Slope Field Example</title>
			<p>
				Now let's look at a more complex example. Consider the differential equation
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dt} = \frac{y^2}{2} - t.
				</me>
				This equation is autonomous, meaning it only depends on \( y \) and not explicitly on \( t \). We can visualize its slope field by calculating the slopes at various points in the \( (t, y) \)-plane.
			</p>

			<p>
				To generate a slope field for this equation, we can use a computer program to calculate the slopes at a grid of points in the \( (t, y) \)-plane. For example, we might calculate the slopes at points like \( (−3, −3), (−3, −2), ..., (3, 3) \). Each point will have a corresponding slope value given by the function \( f(t, y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - t \).
			</p>

			<p>
				Figure ? shows an example of such a slope field. The arrows indicate the direction of the solution curves at each point in the plane. The length of each arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the slope.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this case, we generated
				<me>
					f(t, y) = \frac{y^2}{2} - t
				</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				and plotted the slope field for this equation over the region \( −3 ≤ t ≤ 3 \) and \( −3 ≤ y ≤ 3 \) in the \( (t, y) \)-plane. We calculated values of the function \( f(t, y) \) over 25 × 25 points (625 points) in that region.
				We generated the slope field by calculating the slopes at each of these points and drawing small line segments with those slopes centered at each point.
			</p>
			<p>
				A glance at this slope field suggests that the graph of one solution is a line passing through the points \( (−1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \). Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that are below this line seem to increase until they reach an absolute maximum. Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that are above the line seem to increase more and more rapidly.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, in Section ? we will learn an analytic technique for finding solutions of this equation. We will see that the general solution consists of the family of functions
				<me>
					y(t) = t + 1 + c e^t,
				</me>
				where \( c \) is an arbitrary constant. (At this point it is important to emphasize that, even though we have not studied the technique that gives us these solutions, we can still interpret the slope field and understand the behavior of solutions.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The slope field for this equation over the region <m>−3 ≤ t ≤ 3</m> and <m>−3 ≤ y ≤ 3</m> in the <m>(t, y)</m>-plane is shown in Figure ?. The arrows indicate the direction of the solution curves at each point in the plane, and the length of each arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the slope.
			</p>
			<p>
				We calculated values of the function f (t, y) over 25 × 25 points (625 points) in that region. A glance at this slope field suggests that the graph of one solution is a line passing − through the points (−1, 0) and (0, 1). Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that 1 1 are below this line seem to increase until they reach an absolute maximum. Solutions corresponding to initial conditions that are above the line seem to increase more and more rapidly.
			</p>
			<p>
				In fact, in Section ? we will learn an analytic technique for finding solutions of
				this equation. We will see that the general solution consists of the family of functions
				<me>
					\amp y(t) = t + 1 + c e^t,
				</me>
				where \( c \) is an arbitrary constant. (At this point it is important to emphasize that, even though we have not studied the technique that gives us these solutions, we can still interpret the slope field and understand the behavior of solutions.)

			To get the idea, we'll compare the slope fields for three differential equations:

	<paragraphs><title>A Special Case: <m>t</m>-only Dependence</title>
		<p>
			When the first-order differential equation <xref ref="yp-equals-fty"/> lacks <m>y</m> terms, then its form becomes:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt}=f(t),
			</me>
			where the slopes are determined by just <m>t</m>. We still calculate the slope at <m>(t,y)</m>, but the value of <m>y</m> has no impact on the slope.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this case, the slope generator function <m>f(t)</m> depends only on <m>t</m>, not on <m>y</m>. This means that the slope at any point <m>(t,y)</m> is determined solely by the value of <m>t</m>, and not by the value of <m>y</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Geometrically, this means the slope segment will not change as you move up and down in the <m>y</m> direction. Thus, the slope segment at, say <m>(3, 2)</m>, will be parallel to the slope segment at <m>(3,*)</m> (<m>* = </m> anything). 
		</p>

		<p>
			A nice feature of an equation of the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t)
			</me>
			is that it easily solved by direct integration. The solution is simply the integral of the slope generator function:
			<me>
				y(t) = \int f(t) \, dt + C,
			</me>
			where <m>C</m> is a constant of integration.
		</p>

				<me>
			y(t)=\int f(t)\,dt + C.
		</me>

		<p>
			For example, consider the differential equation
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t.
			</me>
			The slope generator function is <m>f(t) = 2t</m>, which only depends on <m>t</m>. The slope field for this equation consists of horizontal line segments with slopes determined by the value of <m>2t</m> at each point. This means that the solution curves are horizontal lines at each t-value.
		</p>

				<p>
			For instance, when <m>dy/dt = 2t</m> the slopes increase linearly with time, and the slope field consists of equal-length, equally-spaced line segments slanting more steeply as you move right.  The analytic solution <m>y=t^2+C</m> is merely the antiderivative of the slope pattern.
		</p>

	<paragraphs><title>Long-Term Behavior</title>
		<p>
			Equilibrium points are key to understanding the behavior of autonomous differential equations. These are the values of <m>y</m> where <m>dy/dt = 0</m>, in other words, where the solution stays constant over time. But not all equilibrium points behave the same way. To better understand their role, we classify them based on how nearby solutions behave.
		</p>

		<p>
			Imagine an equilibrium point at <m>y = y_0</m>. What happens to a solution that starts just a little below or above <m>y_0</m>? If the arrows on the phase line point <em>toward</em> <m>y_0</m> from both sides, then nearby solutions approach <m>y_0</m> as <m>t</m> increases. We call this kind of equilibrium point a <em>sink</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The term "sink" is meant to help you visualize solutions being drawn inward, like water draining toward a sink. If you start close enough to the equilibrium, you'll end up being pulled into it over time.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now consider a different situation. Suppose the arrows point <em>away</em> from <m>y_0</m> on both sides. Then any solution that starts near <m>y_0</m> moves away from it as time increases. In this case, <m>y_0</m> is called a <em>source</em>, because nearby solutions are pushed outward, like water being sprayed away from a fountain.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sinks and sources are the two most important types of equilibrium points. But not every equilibrium behaves like these. If solutions approach from one side and move away on the other, then <m>y_0</m> is neither a sink nor a source. We call such points <em>nodes</em>. Nodes are still equilibrium points, but they have a more complicated influence on nearby solutions (see Figure).
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's look at an example. Consider the differential equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = y^2 + y - 6 = (y + 3)(y - 2).
		</me>

		<p>
			The equilibrium points are <m>y = -3</m> and <m>y = 2</m>. To classify them, we analyze the sign of <m>dy/dt</m>:
		</p>

		<ul marker="square">
			<li>When <m>-3 &lt; y &lt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &lt; 0</m>, so solutions decrease.</li>
			<li>When <m>y &lt; -3</m> or <m>y &gt; 2</m>, <m>dy/dt &gt; 0</m>, so solutions increase.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This tells us that solutions move toward <m>y = -3</m> and away from <m>y = 2</m>. Therefore, <m>y = -3</m> is a sink, and <m>y = 2</m> is a source.
		</p>

		<p>
			What if we don't have a formula for <m>f(y)</m>, but just a graph? We can still sketch the phase line by looking at where <m>f(y)</m> crosses the axis (equilibrium points) and checking where it's positive or negative.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, suppose we're given a graph of <m>g(w)</m> and see that it has equilibrium points at <m>w = -0.5</m>, <m>w = 1</m>, and <m>w = 2.5</m>. From the graph we estimate:
		</p>

		<ul marker="square">
			<li><m>g(w) &gt; 0</m> when <m>w &lt; -0.5</m>, <m>1 &lt; w &lt; 2.5</m>, and <m>w &gt; 2.5</m></li>
			<li><m>g(w) &lt; 0</m> when <m>-0.5 &lt; w &lt; 1</m></li>
		</ul>

		<example><title>Long-Term Behavior</title>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Based on the slope field for
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4
					</me>,
					describe what happens to solutions over time when the initial condition is <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, <m>y(0) = 1</m>, and <m>y(0) = 2</m>.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					To analyze the long-term behavior, we first find the equilibrium points by solving <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives us:
				</p>
				<me>
					y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
				</me>
				<p>
					which has solutions <m>y = 0</m>, <m>y = 1</m>, and <m>y = -1</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we can sketch the phase line. The sign of <m>f(y)</m> tells us whether solutions increase or decrease:
				</p>

				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
					<li><m>-1 &lt; y &lt; 0:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
					<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → solutions increase.</li>
					<li><m>y = 1:</m> <m>f(y) = 0</m> → equilibrium point.</li>
					<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → solutions decrease.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This means:
				</p>

				<ul marker="square">
					<li>If <m>y(0) = 0.5</m>, the solution increases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
					<li>If <m>y(0) = 1</m>, it stays at <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
					<li>If <m>y(0) = 2</m>, it decreases toward <m>y = 1</m>.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					In summary, all solutions approach the equilibrium point at <em><term><span style="color:blue">y = 1</span></term></em> over time, regardless of their starting value. The equilibrium at <m>y = 1</m> is stable, while the others are unstable.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			Using this sign chart, we draw the phase line and determine:
		</p>

		<ul marker="square">
			<li><m>w = -0.5</m> is a sink (arrows point inward)</li>
			<li><m>w = 1</m> is a source (arrows point outward)</li>
			<li><m>w = 2.5</m> is a node (mixed behavior)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			We've seen that we can classify equilibrium points just by looking at the graph of <m>f(y)</m>. In fact, the behavior of solutions near an equilibrium point depends on whether <m>f(y)</m> is increasing or decreasing there.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, suppose <m>f(y)</m> is decreasing near <m>y_0</m>. That means <m>f(y)</m> is positive just to the left of <m>y_0</m> and negative just to the right, so the arrows point inward, and <m>y_0</m> is a sink. Similarly, if <m>f(y)</m> is increasing near <m>y_0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.
		</p>

		<p>
			This idea leads us to a useful result from calculus. If we take the derivative of <m>f(y)</m> at an equilibrium point, it tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing there. This gives us a fast way to classify the equilibrium point.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Linearization Theorem.</em> Suppose <m>y_0</m> is an equilibrium point of <m>dy/dt = f(y)</m>, and suppose <m>f(y)</m> is continuously differentiable. Then:
		</p>

		<ul marker="square">
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &lt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a sink.</li>
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &gt; 0</m>, then <m>y_0</m> is a source.</li>
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) = 0</m>, then the test is inconclusive, we need more information.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			This result is part of a broader strategy called <em>linearization</em>. The idea is to approximate a nonlinear equation by a linear one near an equilibrium point. The linear equation is easier to analyze and gives good information about nearby behavior.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's try it on a messy example. Suppose:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dt} = h(y) = y(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
		</me>

		<p>
			Clearly, <m>y = 0</m> is an equilibrium point because <m>h(0) = 0</m>. But the equation is too complicated to analyze directly. So we linearize by computing the derivative:
		</p>

		<me>
			h'(y) = (\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4) + y \cdot \frac{d}{dy}(\cos(y^5 + 2y) - 27\pi y^4).
		</me>

		<p>
			Plugging in <m>y = 0</m>, we find <m>h'(0) = \cos(0) = 1</m>. Since <m>h'(0) &gt; 0</m>, the Linearization Theorem tells us that <m>y = 0</m> is a source.
		</p>

		<p>
			But be careful! The result only applies <em>near</em> the equilibrium point. If you start too far away, the linear approximation might not match the behavior of the full nonlinear equation. Still, it's a powerful method: a little bit of calculus gives us a lot of insight.
		</p>
	</paragraphs>


	<paragraphs><title>Phase Lines</title>
		<p>
			This creates a lot of repetition in the slope field. If we know the slope at every height <m>y</m> along a single vertical line (say, <m>t = t_0</m>), then we know the slope everywhere in the <m>t</m><m>y</m>-plane! That's why we introduce a simplified tool: the <em>phase line</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The phase line shows all the important information from the slope field, but compressed into a single vertical diagram. It helps us quickly understand where solutions rise or fall and where they stay constant. You'll see it's a powerful tool for analyzing autonomous equations without doing much calculation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Once we've identified the equilibrium points of an autonomous differential equation, we want to understand how nearby solutions behave. One of the most powerful tools for this is a <term>phase line</term>.
		</p>

		<p>
			A phase line is a one-dimensional diagram that summarizes how solutions change over time, without needing to draw the full slope field. It consists of a vertical line labeled with equilibrium values of <m>y</m>, along with arrows that show whether the solution increases or decreases at each point.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's the idea: if <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> at a particular <m>y</m>-value, then the solution is increasing there, so we draw an upward arrow. If <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m>, the solution is decreasing, so we draw a downward arrow. At equilibrium points where <m>f(y) = 0</m>, we leave a gap or mark the point with a dot, this is where the solution flattens out.
		</p>

		<p>
			The beauty of a phase line is that it lets you see, at a glance, whether equilibrium points are <em>stable</em> (solutions move toward them), <em>unstable</em> (solutions move away), or something more subtle. You can understand the long-term behavior of all solutions just by following the arrows!
		</p>

		<example>
			<title>Drawing a Phase Line</title>
			<statement>
				Sketch the phase line for the autonomous equation <m>\frac{dy}{dx} = y^2 - y^4</m>. Identify all equilibrium points and show where solutions increase or decrease.
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
				First, solve <m>y^2 - y^4 = 0</m>. Factoring gives:
				</p>

				<me>
				y^2(1 - y^2) = 0,
				</me>

				<p>
				which has solutions <m>y = -1</m>, <m>y = 0</m>, and <m>y = 1</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
				Now divide the number line into intervals and test the sign of <m>f(y)</m> in each:
				</p>

				<ul marker="square">
				<li><m>y &lt; -1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>

				<li><m>0 &lt; y &lt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &gt; 0</m> → arrow up</li>
				<li><m>y &gt; 1:</m> <m>f(y) &lt; 0</m> → arrow down</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Phase line sketch:</p>
				<draw width="300" height="200">

				<text x="130" y="155">−1</text>
				<!-- Add directional arrows -->
				<!-- y > 1 -->
				<line x1="150" y1="0" x2="150" y2="45" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
				<!-- 0 < y < 1 -->
				<line x1="150" y1="55" x2="150" y2="95" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
				<!-- -1 < y < 0 -->
				<line x1="150" y1="105" x2="150" y2="145" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-up)"/>
				<!-- y < -1 -->
				<line x1="150" y1="155" x2="150" y2="195" stroke="black" marker-end="url(#arrow-down)"/>
				</draw>

				<p>
				From this diagram, we see:
				</p>

				<ul marker="square">
				<li><m>y = -1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
				<li><m>y = 0</m> is unstable (source)</li>
				<li><m>y = 1</m> is stable (sink)</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				So, solutions starting near <m>y = 0</m> move away from it. Solutions starting between <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> move toward <m>y = 1</m>, and so on. The phase line gives a complete picture of how the system behaves in the long run, without drawing any solution curves!

			The basic idea is to take a nonlinear function <m>f(y)</m> and find its derivative at an equilibrium point <m>y_0</m>. This gives us a linear approximation of the function near that point. The sign of the derivative tells us whether the equilibrium is stable or unstable:
		</p>
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &lt; 0</m>, then the equilibrium is a sink (stable).</li>
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) &gt; 0</m>, then the equilibrium is a source (unstable).</li>
			<li>If <m>f'(y_0) = 0</m>, the test is inconclusive, and we need more information.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This method is particularly useful when dealing with complex nonlinear equations, as it simplifies the analysis significantly. By focusing on the behavior of the derivative, we can quickly classify equilibrium points without needing to solve the entire equation.
		</p>

			For example, consider the equation <m>dy/dt = f(y) = y^2 - 4y + 3</m>. The equilibrium points are found by solving <m>f(y) = 0</m>, which gives us <m>y = 1</m> and <m>y = 3</m>. To classify these points, we compute the derivative:
		</p>
		<me>
			f'(y) = 2y - 4.
		</me>
		<p>
			Evaluating at the equilibrium points:
		</p>
		<ul marker="square">
			<li>At <m>y = 1</m>: <m>f'(1) = 2(1) - 4 = -2 &lt; 0</m> → sink (stable).</li>
			<li>At <m>y = 3</m>: <m>f'(3) = 2(3) - 4 = 2 &gt; 0</m> → source (unstable).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This tells us that solutions near <m>y = 1</m> will approach it over time, while solutions near <m>y = 3</m> will move away.
		</p>

			The linearization method is a powerful tool for understanding the long-term behavior of solutions to autonomous differential equations. By focusing on the derivative at equilibrium points, we can quickly classify their stability and gain insight into the dynamics of the system.
