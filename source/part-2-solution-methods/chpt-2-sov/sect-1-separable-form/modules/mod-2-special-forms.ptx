        A differential equation can still be <xref ref="def-separable" text="custom">separable</xref> even if one or both of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(y)</m> appear to be missing. For example, the DE,
        <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = x^2 </me>
        is technically separable since it can be written as 
        <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = (\underset{f(x)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} x^2 }}) \cdot (\underset{g(y)}{\underset{\uparrow}{ \vphantom{|} 1 }}) </me>
        and <m>g(y)</m> is a constant function. The same concept could be applied if <m>f(x)</m> was missing.

            The following first-order differential equations are separable.

            Determine if the following DE is separable.
            <me> \frac{dz}{dt} = \cos^2 z </me>

            <p>
                Again, we note that the DE is first order. Since the derivative is already isolated, we need only determine whether we can write the right hand of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m>, and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>t</m>. Consider the following equivalent equation. <me> \frac{dz}{dt} =  \big( 1 \big)  \cdot \big( \cos^2 z \big) </me> This may seem like a bit of a cop-out, but we have actually satisfied the definition of separable. The first factor is a function that does not contain any <m>z</m>'s, and the second factor is a function that does not contain and <m>t</m>'s. It doesn't matter that the first factor is a constant function; it could be any function we like, so long as it doesn't contain the dependent variable <m>z</m>. We have demonstrated that this DE <em>is separable</em>.

                        We can show it is separable by rewriting it as
                        <me>
                        \frac{dP}{dt} = \underset{f(P)}{\underbrace{(\ \pi + 5 \ )}} \cdot \underset{g(t)}{\underbrace{(\ 1 \ )}} \qquad \text{ or } \qquad \frac{dP}{dt} = \underset{f(P)}{\underbrace{(\ 1 \ )}} \cdot \underset{g(t)}{\underbrace{(\ \pi + 5 \ )}}
