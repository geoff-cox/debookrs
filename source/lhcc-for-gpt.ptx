<section><title> Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficients </title>
	
	<introduction>

		<p>
			As you can imagine, the higher the derivative that appears in a differential equation, the more complex the equation becomes. Fortunately, there is a class of higher-order equations that are relatively easy to solve and make for a great warm-up to the more challenging equations we will encounter later. This class of equations are called linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC).
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In this section, we will learn to identify this new class of equations using the new tags of homogeneity and constant coefficients. We will then explore the technique that finds the solution to these equations by linking them directly to a special equation called the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
		</p>

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> LHCC Equations </title>
	
		<p>
			As mentioned in the introduction, the new class of equations are linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. For brevity, we will refer to this type of equation an LHCC equation. Before we can begin solving these equations, we need to be able to recognize them when we see them. Formally, the three tags that define an LHCC equation are
			<em> linear </em>, <em> homogeneous </em>, and <em> constant coefficients </em>.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			A linear differential equation has the form
			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
				\os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x).}}
			</men>
			If the constant term is zero, then this equation is <term>homogeneous</term>. Additionally, if all the coefficients are numbers, then the equation has <term>constant coefficients</term>. The next definition brings all of these ideas together.
		</p>
	
		<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) has the form 
				</p>
				<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
				</men>
				<p>
					where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
	
		<p>
			Let's practice identifying this new group of equations with a few examples.
		</p>
	
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Which of the linear differential equations below are homogeneous?
				</p>
				<me> 
					3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, 		\quad 
					\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, 	\quad 
					\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s 
				</me>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The trick is to see if the constant term is zero. Recall, the constant term should not contain the dependent variable or its derivatives. Rewriting each equation with the constant term on the right makes it more clear. 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<me> 
						3y'' - 2ty' + y	= \color{blue}{0}, 		\quad 
						\frac{dg}{dx}	= \color{blue}{-3x^2}, 	\quad 
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = \color{blue}{0} 
					</me>.
					As you can see the first and last equations are homogeneous.
				</p>
			</solution>
	
		</example>
	
		<example>
	
			<statement>
				<p>
					Which of the linear differential equations have constant coefficients?
				</p>
				<me> 
					3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, 				\quad 
					\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, 	\quad 
					s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
				</me>

				<p>
					For this question, we check if each coefficient is constant.

						\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} 			s''' = 
						\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}}	s

					Only the second equation has constant coefficients.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> LHCC Solutions </title>

		<p>
			Our goal is to solve a new class of <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>. Before diving into solutions, let's develop some intuition about the nature of these solutions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recall from calculus the function whose derivative is itself. If you thought of <m>e^x</m>, you are correct! This idea can be framed as a differential equation: find the function <m>y</m> such that the derivative of <m>y</m> is <m>y</m>. In other words, solve the LHCC equation
			<me>
				y' = y \quad \text{or} \quad y' - y = 0.
			</me>
			The solution is <m>y = e^x</m>, but it's also true that <m>y = c e^x</m> for any constant <m>c</m>. Now, consider a function whose derivative is a multiple of itself, say <m>3y</m>. You might think of <m>y = e^{3x}</m>, which follows from the chain rule. If this isn't obvious, you can solve the equation <m>y' = 3y</m> using separation of variables to find the general solution <m>y = c e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This leads us to an important concept:
			<assemblage><title> Property of the Exponential Function </title>
				<p>
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>e^{rx}</m> is the only function whose derivative is a multiple of itself.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>e^{rx}</m> and its derivatives are <q>like terms</q> that can be combined.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</assemblage>
			Most functions change fundamentally when differentiated and do not yield <q>like terms</q> that can be combined. For example, the derivative of <m>x^8</m> is <m>8x^7</m>, which cannot be combined or simplified in the same way. However, <m>e^{3x}</m> and its derivative <m>3e^{3x}</m> can be added together as <m>e^{3x} + 3e^{3x} = 4e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Going back to the LHCC equation,
			<men xml:id="lhcc-equation-like-terms">
				\us{\text{must sum to } 0 \text{ after substituting } y}{\ub{
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y
				}}	= 0
			</men>,
			we see the right-hand side is zero, so the left-hand side must sum to zero after substituting <m>y</m>. This can only happen if the solution <m>y</m> and its derivatives combine to cancel each other out. However, the only possible functions that can be substituted for <m>y</m> are ones that contain <m>e^{rx}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's look at a concrete example to illustrate why <m>e^{rx}</m> simplifies nicely in these equations, while other functions may not.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the LHCC equation:
				</p>
				<me>
					y'' + 3y' - 4y = 0.
				</me>
				<p>
					Verify that <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution, but <m>y = x^4</m> and <m>y = \sin(4x)</m> are not.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Let's check each function:
				</p>
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[e^{4x}]'' + 3\left[e^{4x}\right]' - 4\left[e^{4x}\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{like terms simplify to }0}{\ub{
									16e^{4x} + 12e^{4x} - 4e^{4x}	
								}}
								\amp= 0	
							</mrow>
							<mrow> 	0	\amp= 0	\ \ ✅ </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[x^4]'' + 3\left[x^4\right]' - 4\left[x^4\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{not like terms}}{\ub{
									24x^2 + 12x^3 - 4x^4	
								}}
								\amp= 0	\ \ ❌
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> 	[\sin(4x)]'' + 3\left[\sin(4x)\right]' - 4\left[\sin(4x)\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	
							\us{\text{not like terms}}{\ub{
								-16\sin(4x) + 12\cos(4x) - 4\sin(4x)	
							}}
							\amp= 0	\ \ ❌
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					Of these three, only <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			This example shows that <m>e^{rx}</m> is best suited for LHCC equations, but it doesn't tell the whole story. In some cases, if <m>e^{rx}</m> is a solution, then it is possible that <m>xe^{rx}</m> could also be a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			The takeaway from this section should be that solutions to LHCC equations must involve <m>e^{rx}</m>, but not every value of <m>r</m> works. In the next section, we will see that the key to finding the general solution lies in finding the values of <m>r</m> that correspond to solutions.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Characteristic Equation </title>

		<p>
			The previous section showed us that solutions to LHCC equations involve <m>e^{rx}</m> terms. We will now build on this idea by showing that every LHCC equation is associated with another equation that allows us to find the specific <m>r</m>-values that give us our solutions. Let's explore this by looking at a few concrete examples, starting the equation
			<me>y' - 5y = 0</me>,
			Now, imagine we wanted verify that <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is a solution to this equation. To do this, we plug it into the equation and see if it leads to <m>0=0</m>. In this case, we get
			<md>
				<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right] \amp= 0 </mrow>
				<mrow>	r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
				<mrow>	\us{\text{must be 0}}{\ub{(r - 5) e^{rx}}} \amp= 0 </mrow>
			</md>,
			which shows that the left-side must also be <m>0</m>, but this only happens for specific <m>r</m>-values. To find them, we solve 
			<md>
				<mrow>	(r - 5) e^{rx}	=\amp \ 0 \qquad (e^{rx} \text{ is never 0})</mrow>
				<mrow>			r - 5	=\amp \ 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad r = 5</mrow>
			</md>,
			showing that <m>e^{5x}</m> is a solution. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, let's add a second derivative to the equation, say 
			<me>y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0</me>,
			and plug <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into this equation:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]'' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right]' + 6 \left[e^{rx}\right] \amp= 0 </mrow>
			<mrow>	r^2 e^{rx} - 5 r e^{rx} + 6 e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
			<mrow>	(r^2 - 5r + 6) e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
		</md>
		<p>
			Again, <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, so we must have <m>r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0</m>. Solving this quadratic equation gives <m>r = 2</m> and <m>r = 3</m>, yielding the solutions <m>e^{2x}</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Let's generalize this idea by plugging <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the general <xref ref="lhcc-equation" text="custom">LHCC equation</xref>:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>	
				a_n\ \left[e^{rx}\right]^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ \left[e^{rx}\right]'' + a_1\ \left[e^{rx}\right]' + a_0\ e^{rx} \amp= 0 
			</mrow>
			<mrow>	a_n\ r^n e^{rx} + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 e^{rx} + a_1\ r e^{rx} + a_0\ e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
			<mrow>	\left(a_n\ r^n + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 + a_1\ r + a_0\right)e^{rx}  \amp= 0 </mrow>
		</md>.
		<p>
			Following the same pattern as before, we get the <m>r</m>-values we need by solving
		</p>
		<me>
			a_n\ r^n + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 + a_1\ r + a_0 = 0
		</me>.
		<p>
			This polynomial equation that gives us the <m>r</m>-values we need to write down our solutions is referred to as the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
