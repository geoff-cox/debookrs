	<p>
		You might not realize it, but solving some differential equations is a skill you already have! For example, when you compute the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m>, you are finding a function <m>y</m> whose derivative is <m>x^2</m>. In other words:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<q>Find <m>y</m> such that the derivative of <m>y</m> is <m>x^2</m>?</q>
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>
		However, this directly translates into the differential equation problem:
	</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>
			<q>Find <m>y</m> such that <m>\ \ds \frac{d}{dx}[y] = x^2</m>.</q>
		</p>
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>
		To find <m>y</m>, you can integrate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>,
	</p>
	
	<md>
		<mrow> \int\frac{d}{dx}[y]\ dx	\amp = \int x^2\ dx				</mrow>
		<mrow> 					y + c_1	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2		</mrow>
		<mrow> 						y	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2 - c_1 \quad \implies \quad y = \frac13 x^3 + c	</mrow>
	</md>
	
	<p>
		Here, <m>c = c_2 - c_1</m>, which is just another constant. Therefore, the solution is the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> with a single constant of integration:
	</p>

	<me>
		y = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + c
	</me>.

	<p>
		Now, let's look at a slightly more complex example.
	</p>
	
	<example><title> Isolate <m>y</m> </title>
		<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Find the function, <m>y</m>, such that 
					<me>
						2y' - 4\sin x = 2
					</me>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				This is another antiderivative problem where we first have to isolate <m>y'</m> before integrating, like so
			</p>
			
			<me>
				y' = 1 + 2 \sin x
			</me>.
			
			<p>
				This equation now says <q>The unknown <m>y</m> is the function whose derivative is <m>1 + 2 \sin x</m></q> or, in other words,
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<q>The unknown <m>y</m> is the antiderivative of <m>1 + 2 \sin x</m></q>.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				Instead of writing down the antiderivative as our solution, let's take the differential equations approach and integrate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>
			</p>
			
			<md>
				<mrow> \int y'\ dx 	\amp = \int \left(1 + 2 \sin x\right) \ dx 				</mrow>
				<mrow> 	y + c_1 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + c_2 								</mrow>
				<mrow> 			y 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + \boxed{c_2 - c_1}\leftarrow c		</mrow>
				<mrow> 		y(x)	\amp  = x - 2 \cos x + c 								</mrow>.
			</md>
			
			<p>
				As before, the constants of integration are combined into a single constant <m>c</m>. This practice of merging constants is standard in solving differential equations and simplifies the final result.
			</p>

	<p>
		In summary, solving simple differential equations often reduces to finding the antiderivative of a function. By integrating both sides and simplifying constants, you can find the general solution.
