	<p>
		You might be surprised to realize that solving some differential equations is a skill you already have! For example, when you find the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m>, you are finding a function whose derivative is <m>x^2</m>. Another way to say this is 
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<q>What is <m>y</m> if the derivative of <m>y</m> is <m>x^2</m>?</q>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		However, this translates into solving for <m>y</m> in either of the differential equations
	</p>
	
	<men xml:id="antiderivative-eqn0">
		\frac{d}{dx}[y] = x^2 \quad \text{or} \quad y^\prime = x^2.
	</men>
	
	<p>
		To find <m>y</m>, you can integrate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>, turning it into an antiderivative problem from calculus:
	</p>
	
	<md>
		<mrow> \int\frac{d}{dx}[y]\ dx	\amp = \int x^2\ dx				</mrow>
		<mrow> 					y + c_1	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2		</mrow>
		<mrow> 						y	\amp = \frac13 x^3 + c_2 - c_1 \quad \implies \quad y = \frac13 x^3 + c	</mrow>
	</md>
	
	<p>
		Here, <m>c = c_2 - c_1</m>, which is a constant (the difference of two constants is still a constant). Thus, the solution is the antiderivative of <m>x^2</m> you know well: <me>
			y = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + c
		</me>. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Let's explore another example with the differential equation:
	</p>
	
	<me>2y' - 4\sin x = 2.</me>
	
	<p>
		First, isolate <m>y'</m>:
	</p>
	
	<me>y' = 1 + 2 \sin x.</me>
	
	<p>
		This tells us that <m>y</m> is the function whose derivative is <m>1 + 2 \sin x</m>â€”that is, the antiderivative of <m>1 + 2 \sin x</m>. Integrating both sides gives:
	</p>
	
	<md>
		<mrow> \int y'\ dx 	\amp = \int \left(1 + 2 \sin x\right) \ dx 				</mrow>
		<mrow> 	y + c_1 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + c_2 								</mrow>
		<mrow> 			y 	\amp = x - 2 \cos x + \boxed{c_2 - c_1}\leftarrow c		</mrow>
		<mrow> 		y(x)	\amp  = x - 2 \cos x + c 								</mrow>.
	</md>
	
	<p>
		Again, we merge the constants into a single constant, <m>c</m>. This practice of combining constants is standard in differential equations and is an important part of the solution process.
