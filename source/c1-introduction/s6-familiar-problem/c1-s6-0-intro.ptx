		Solving a differential equation might sound like a new challenge, but chances are you've already encountered it without even realizing it. In calculus, when computing an antiderivative, you were actually solving a simple differential equation.

		In this section, we will revisit this familiar concept and expand it to cover slightly more complex equations. You will learn how to isolate the dependent variable and find the general solution by integrating both sides of the equation. Throughout this process, we will also discuss the importance of constants of integration and demonstrate how initial conditions can be applied to find a specific solution.

		By the end of this section, you'll see that solving first-order differential equations often builds directly on the skills you already have from calculus. These techniques provide a foundation for more advanced methods, including the integrating factor method, which we'll explore later.
