		One of the fundamental goals in differential equations is learning to find their solutions. In fact, most problems that you will encounter will start with: 
		<blockquote>
			<em><q>Find the solution to following differential equation.</q></em>
		</blockquote>
		While this might seem straightforward—just solve and move on—it leads to an important question that many students overlook:
		<blockquote>
			<em><q>What does it mean to be a solution to a differential equation?</q></em>
		</blockquote>
	</p>

		At its core, a solution to a differential equation is not just a number or function you stumble upon; it's a function that satisfies the equation in every respect. This section will guide you through the key concepts of solutionsand by the end of this section, you will be able to verify whether a given function is a solution to a differential equation and identify it as either a general or particular solution.
