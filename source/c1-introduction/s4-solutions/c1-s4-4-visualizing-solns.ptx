	<p>
        A powerful way to enhance your understanding of different solution types is through visualization. In this section, we will explore a graphical representation of a family of solutions and how an initial condition can help us pinpoint particular solutions from this family.
    </p>

    <p>
        Consider the differential equation
        <men xml:id="visualizing-solns-eqn">
			\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x,
		</men>
        which has the general solution
        <me>
			y = c e^{x^2} + 3
		</me>.
		<aside><title> ℹ️ Details </title>
			<p>
				See <xref ref="visualization-verifying-gen-soln"/> for the steps to verify that <m>y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m>	is a general solution to equation <xref ref="visualizing-solns-eqn"/>.
			</p>
		</aside>
    </p>

	<p>
		As you know, the general solution contains a constant <m>c</m> that can take any real value. This constant generates a family of solutions, each corresponding to a different value of <m>c</m>. To visualize this family of solutions, we plot the general solution for various values of <m>c</m> as shown in <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure"/>. 
	</p>

	<p>
		In the figure, each green curve represents a particular solution. The blue curve is a particular solution that passes through the initial condition <m>y(0)</m>. While the figure shows only a few members of the family of solutions, there exists a solution curve for every possible value of <m>c</m>.

		<statement>
			<p>
				To verify that <m>\ds y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> is a solution, we move all terms to one side of the equation and substitute <m>\ds y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> into the equation.

					<mrow> 													\frac{dy}{dx} - 2xy + 6x	=\amp\ 0</mrow>
					<mrow> \frac{d}{dx}\left( ce^{x^2} + 3 \right) - 2x\left( ce^{x^2} + 3 \right) + 6x	=\amp\ 0</mrow>
