<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> General &amp; Particular Solutions </title>

	<p>
		By now, you understand that a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies the equation. However, a single differential equation can have multiple solutions, as demonstrated in <xref ref="one-de-many-solns"/>. In fact, the same example shows that a differential equation can have infinitely many solutions since <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution for infinitely many choices of the constant <m>c</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To make sense of this, we will classify solutions into three key categories:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<li>
			<title>General Solution:</title>
			<p>
				A general solution contains one or more arbitrary constants, such as <m>c</m> in <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> and provides a <q>template</q> for generating specific solutions by choosing values for these constants.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<title>Particular Solution:</title>
			<p>
				A particular solution is derived by assigning specific values to the constants in the general solution. For example, setting <m>c = 5</m> in <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> yields the particular solution <m>y = 5 e^{2x}</m>.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<title>Family of Solutions:</title>
			<p>
				This refers to the collection of all particular solutions. 
			</p>
		</li>
	</dl>

	<p>
		To illustrate, consider the differential equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m> again:
	</p>
	<dl>
		<li><title>General Solution:</title>
			<p>
				<m>\ds y = c e^{2x}</m>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><title>Particular Solutions:</title>
			<p>
				<m>\ds y = 5e^{2x}, \quad y = 3.1e^{2x}, \quad y = -2e^{2x}, \quad \text{etc.}</m>
			</p>
		</li>
		<li><title>Family of Solutions:</title>
			<p>
				<m>\ds \left\{ \text{ all possible particular solutions for each } c \ \right\}</m>
			</p>
		</li>
	</dl>

	<p>
		Here is an analogy to help clarify this idea. Imagine a family of solutions as a collection of all possible dates in October 2025. The general solution would be a template like <c>10/dd/2025</c>, while particular solutions would be specific dates, such as <c>10/01/2025</c>, <c>10/02/2025</c>, and so on.
	</p>

	<p>
		The distinction between these solution types is crucial because it lays the groundwork for understanding how initial conditions and other constraints narrow the infinite possibilities of the general solution into a unique particular solution. Keep this in mind as we explore more advanced differential equation techniques.
