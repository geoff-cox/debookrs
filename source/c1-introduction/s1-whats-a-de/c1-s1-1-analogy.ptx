		When you learn something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for <m>y</m>.
	</p>

	<sidebyside>
		<p><me>y + 3 = 11</me></p>
		<p><me>y + 3x = 11</me></p>
		<p><me>y^\prime + 3x = 11</me></p>
	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		All three are equations with the same goalâ€”finding the unknown <m>y</m>. However, only the third equation is a <em>differential equation</em> because it contains a derivative. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, let's try solving for <m>y</m> in each case.
	</p>

	<sidebyside>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>y + 3 =\amp\ 11	</mrow>
				<mrow>y 	=\amp\ 8	</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>y + 3x 	=\amp\ 11		</mrow>
				<mrow>y 		=\amp\ 11 - 3x	</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			<md>
				<mrow>y^\prime + 3x	=\amp\ 11		</mrow>
				<mrow>y^\prime 		=\amp\ 11 - 3x	</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

	</sidebyside>

	<p>
		In the first equation, we found <m>y</m> as a number, and in the second, it's a function of <m>x</m>. But in the last equation, how do we solve for <m>y</m> with a derivative attached to it? This is exactly the kind of question you will get in differential equations and the answer is the function that has <m>11-3x</m> as its derivative. If you've already thought of the answer, then you just solved a differential equation!
	</p>

	<p>
		We'll dive deeper into more probelms like this soon, but there's still plenty more to learn about the basics, so let's keep going!
