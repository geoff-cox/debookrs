		Now that you know how to identify a differential equation, the next step is to familiarize yourself with its various components, such as variables, terms, and coefficients. This section will introduce you to these elements and define them within the context of differential equations.

		In the realm of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is essential. This classification determines the strategies in the solution process and gives insight into the complexity of the equation.

		Identifying the linearity of a differential equation may seem challenging at first, but the task becomes straightforward with this guiding principle:
		<blockquote>
			<p>
				<q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q>
			</p>
		</blockquote>
		Therefore, we will start by discussing what it means for a term to be linear and then extend this concept to the entire differential equation.
