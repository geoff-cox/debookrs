	<p>
		As long as an equation contains at least one derivative, then it is a differential equation. However, this also means that there is no restriction on the number of derivatives that can appear in an equation. In general, the more derivatives present, the more complex the equation. To represent this complexity, differential equations are classified by an <term>order</term>, which refers to the highest derivative present in the equation. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, the differential equation
		<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</me>
		is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>. In contrast, the equation
		<me>x^2y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8</me>
		is a <em>third-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>y'''</m>. 
	</p>
	
	<example><title> Identify the Order </title>
		<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
					For each of the following differential equations, identify the order.
					<me>
						\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17, \qquad w^6 + \sin\big(w^{(5)}\big) = 0
					</me>
					
				</p>
			</statement>
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation has <em>second-order</em> since the highest derivative of <m>A</m> is <m>2</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second equation has <em>fifth-order</em> because the highest derivative is <m>\ds w^{(5)}</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>

	<note><title>A Common Pitfall: Derivatives vs. Exponents</title>
		<p>
			This example highlights that you should be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. Since <m>w^6</m> is <m>w</m> to the 6th power, it does not contribute to the order of the equation. Only derivatives affect the order.
