<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Linearity </title>

	<p>
		Extending the concept of linear terms, we say <q>A differential equation is linear only if all its terms are linear.</q> This idea leads us to the following definition of a linear differential equation (of any order).
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			<p>
				A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it can be written as the sum of linear terms, like so
				<fn>
					<p>
						This is commonly referred to a <term> linear combination </term> of the dependent variable and its derivatives.
					</p>
				</fn>
				<men xml:id="linear-equation">
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)\ y^{(n)}}} + \cdots +
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)\ y''}} + 
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)\ y'}} +
					\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)\ y}} = f(t)
				</men>
				If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		We are now equipped to determine the linearity of a differential equation by examining the linearity of each term, as demonstrated in the next example.
	</p>

	<example><title> Identify the Linearity of the Equation </title>
		<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Determine the linearity of each differential equation.
					<me>
						y^{(5)} + \frac{y'}{x^2} + 5y = \ln x, \qquad P^{(6)} + \frac{m P'}{P} = (m - 1)^2
					</me>
					
				</p>
			</statement>
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				To determine the linearity, we need to examine the linearity of each term, remembering to focus only on the dependent variable and its derivatives.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the first equation, the dependent variable is <m>y</m> and we can label the linearity of each terms as follows:
				<md>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}{\color{BurntOrange} y^{(5)} }} + 
						\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\frac{1}{x^2}{\color{BurntOrange} y'}} + 
						\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}5{\color{BurntOrange} y}} =\ \amp 
						\underset{\overline{\text{linear}}}{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln x}.
					</mrow>
				</md>
				Since every term is linear, the differential equation is linear.
			</p>

			<p>
				For the second equation, the dependent variable is <m>P</m> and the terms are labeled as
				<md>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}\color{BurntOrange} P^{(6)}}} + 
						\underset{\overline{\text{nonlinear}}}{m\frac{{\color{BurntOrange} P'}}{{\color{BurntOrange} P}}} =\ \amp 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\vphantom{\frac11}(m - 1)^2}}
					</mrow>,
				</md>
				showing the differential equation is nonlinear since there is at least one nonlinear term.
			</p>
