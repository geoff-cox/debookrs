<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>

	<p>
		At the heart of solving a differential equation is identifying its variables. In every differential equation, we deal with two types of variables:
	</p>

	<dl>
		<li>
			<title>Dependent Variable:</title>
			<p>
				The unknown function we aim to solve for. It depends on the other variable(s) in the equation.
			</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<title>Independent Variable:</title>
			<p>
				The variable that the dependent variable changes with respect to.
			</p>
		</li>
	</dl>

	<p>
		Let's make this concrete with a simple example. Consider the differential equation:
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
		</men>
		Here, <m>y</m> is the dependent variableâ€”it is the unknown function we are solving for. We know <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m> because of the presence of <m>dy/dx</m> (i.e. the rate of change of <m>y</m> as <m>x</m> changes). Therefore, <m>x</m> is the independent variable because <m>y</m> changes as <m>x</m> changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		Identifying these roles is essential because it tells us what we are solving for and influences tools we can use to solve the equation.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="c1-s2-1-ex1"><title> Identify the Variables </title>
		<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let's practice identifying variables in the following differential equations:
					<me>
						\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\quad 
						u'' + t^2 u = 0,\quad 
						Q'' = 11Q
					</me>
					
				</p>
			</statement>
		</p>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation contains <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies <m>P</m> changes as <m>s</m> changes. So,
				<ul>
					<li><m>P</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
					<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow P</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow s</m> .</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> is the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So, <m>u</m> must change as <m>t</m> changes and
				<ul>
					<li><m>u</m> is the <em>unknown</em> function we solve for that depends on <m>t</m>.</li>
					<li><em>dependent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow u</m> , <em>independent variable</em> <m>\rightarrow t</m> .</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> indicates that <m>Q</m> is changing and so it must be the <em>dependent variable</em>. Typically, if no independent variable is shown and the context of the problem doesn't provide it, then you are free to choose it yourself.
