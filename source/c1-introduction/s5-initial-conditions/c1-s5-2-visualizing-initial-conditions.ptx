	<p>
		Visualizing solutions with initial conditions can further enhance understanding. For instance, <xref ref="initial-conditions-figure-1" /> shows the initial condition <m>y(0) = 2</m> as the point <m>(0, 2)</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis. The blue curve represents the unique particular solution passing through this point.

				<em>In the graph, the point on the <m>y</m>-axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the <m>y</m>-axis.</em>
			</p>

			<p>
				As you drag the point, make the following observations:

			<ul marker="square">
				<li>
					<p>
						Each new value of <m>y(0)</m> determines a new value for <m>c</m>, resulting in a different particular solution (blue curve).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Only one particular solution from the family (green curves) passes through any given initial condition.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

		In summary, while the general solution represents all possible solutions to a differential equation, initial conditions allow us to identify the specific solution that applies to a given problem. This process is crucial for applying differential equations to real-world scenarios.
