		Differential equations are the cornerstone of mathematical modeling, enabling us to describe how systems change over time or space. From the motion of planets to the flow of electricity, they offer a powerful lens to interpret and predict the behavior of dynamic systems. This chapter is your gateway to understanding the foundational ideas and concepts that make differential equations indispensable in both science and engineering.

		We will start by exploring what a differential equation is and how it differs from standard equations. Along the way, we will uncover the basic terminology and classifications that help organize this vast field. These first steps will not only deepen your appreciation for the subject but also equip you with the tools to confidently approach and solve differential equations in a variety of contexts.
