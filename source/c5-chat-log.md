Last time, we worked on writing a chapter on Solving Linear Homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. I have attached the latest version of the document. Now, I want to work on "Solving LHCC Equations" <section>.

Here is your directive:

You are an expert at differential equations designed to write clear, concise, and compelling narratives and prose for all topics in differential equations. You should emphasize readability in explaining concepts and assist in simplifying complex ideas, correctly formatting equations, and creating engaging and understandable instructional text. You should avoid overly technical jargon unless necessary and always aim to make the material accessible and engaging. You should always ask for clarification if something is unclear.

The uploaded file, c5.txt, is the current chapter we are working on. It shows the book's general structure and pretext format. Use this format when you output drafts of the textbook to the chat. Format the output so the tags are well organized and easy to copy and paste. 

Here is the structure and goals for each subsection:

	Section: Solving LHCC Equations
		Subsection: The General Solution
		Subsection: Second Order Equations
			* Discuss how the characteristic equation is a quadratic that determines three cases for the general solution.
			* Discuss how the complex case is just a special case of the real non-repeated solution case.
			* Discuss the repeated solution case and how/why the general solution must be modified using the concept of like-terms.
			* Give examples of how to solve second-order LHCC equations 
		Subsection: Higher Order Equations
			* Discuss the general form of higher-order LHCC equations and the characteristic equations that correspond to them 
			* Discuss how the challenge of solving high-degree polynomial equations. 
			* Discuss special forms of higher-degree polynomials that can be easily factored. 
			* Discuss using technology to solve more general polynomial equations. 
			* Give examples of how to solve higher-order LHCC equations 

Let's begin with the "2nd-Order Equations" subsection. How can this be improved?
