		<p>
			Bifurcation analysis studies how the qualitative behavior of a system changes as parameters vary. In the context of differential equations, this often involves identifying critical values where the stability of equilibria changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			For example, consider a system described by the equation:
			<me>
				\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, \mu),
			</me>
			where <m>\mu</m> is a parameter. As <m>\mu</m> varies, the stability of equilibria can change, leading to bifurcations where new equilibria appear or existing ones disappear.
		</p>
		<p>
			To analyze bifurcations, we typically:
			<ol>
				<li>Identify the equilibria by solving <m>f(x, \mu) = 0</m>.</li>
				<li>Determine the stability of each equilibrium by analyzing the derivative <m>\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}</m>.</li>
				<li>Track how the stability changes as <m>\mu</m> varies.</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Bifurcation diagrams can be used to visualize these changes, showing how the number and stability of equilibria depend on the parameter <m>\mu</m>.
