	<title> Piecewise Forcing Functions </title> 

	<introduction>
		<p>
			Many physical systems behave in ways that are not smooth or continuous, they start and stop suddenly, shift directions, or turn on for limited periods of time. These kinds of abrupt behaviors are best described using <em>piecewise functions</em>, which assign different rules to different time intervals.
		</p>

		<p>
			When modeling such situations with differential equations, piecewise functions typically appear on the right-hand side, acting as inputs or forcing functions that switch behavior at specific moments. Consider, for instance, an electrical circuit whose current <m>i(t)</m> changes its driving voltage at predetermined intervals. This scenario might be described by an equation like:
			<me>
				\frac{di(t)}{dt} + 2i(t)
				= \left\{
				\begin{array}{ll}
					1,	\amp 0 \le t \lt 2\\
					-1,	\amp 2 \le t \lt 4\\
					0,	\amp t \ge 4
				\end{array} \right.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The key is to represent each segment of the piecewise function using <em>unit step functions</em>. These are simple mathematical ON-OFF switches that let us write piecewise behavior in a single, concise formula. Once in unit step form, we can systematically apply Laplace transform rules and solve the equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this section, you'll learn how to rewrite piecewise functions using unit step notation, understand different types of switching behavior (ON, OFF, and ON-for-a-while), and convert any piecewise function into a form suitable for Laplace analysis. These tools will be essential for handling real-world systems with piecewise inputs.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Piecewise functions might seem messy at first, they're defined in chunks, with each piece active over a different interval. But there's a clever way to write them as a sum of pieces that turn ON and OFF in specific regions.

							\begin{array}{cc}
								\DLBb \sin t,	\amp \DLBb t \lt 0		\\
								\DLGa 2e^{-t},	\amp \DLGa 0 \ge t \lt 2	\\

					</figure>
				</sidebyside>
				Another way we can visualize <m>g(t)</m> is by imagining its graph, in <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function"/>, as the sum of the disconnected pieces in <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-pieces"/>. 
			</p>

			</figure>

			<p>
				As <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function-pieces"/> shows, only one piece is active at a time, and the others are turned OFF. This means that we can think of <m>g(t)</m> as a sum of three pieces, each multiplied by an ON-OFF switch that triggers at the right times. Such switches come in the form of a simple piecewise function that is <m>1</m> on a given interval and <m>0</m> otherwise. That is, we can write:
			</p>

			<me>
				g(t) =
				{\DLBb \sin t} \cdot
				\us{\large\text{on-off switch}}{
				\boxed{
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{l}
					1,\ \ \DLBb t \lt 0\\
					0,\ \ \small\text{otherwise}
				\end{array}
				\right.}}\ \
				+\ \
				{\DLGa 2e^{-t}} \cdot
				\us{\large\text{off-on-off switch}}{
				\boxed{
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{l}
					1,\ \ \DLGa 0 \ge t \lt 2\\
					0,\ \ \small\text{otherwise}
				\end{array}
				\right.}}\ \
				+\ \
				{\DLO 1.5} \cdot
				\us{\large\text{off-on switch}}{
				\boxed{
				\left\{
				\begin{array}{l}
					1,\ \ \DLO t \ge 2\\
					0,\ \ \small\text{otherwise}.
				\end{array}
				\right.}}
			</me>

				The piecewise functions representing these switches are called <em>unit step functions</em> and they are the key to writing piecewise functions in a clean, compact way. In this section, will take a deeper look into these special functions that unlock a path to applying Laplace transforms to piecewise functions.

			<reading-questions><title> 👀 <em>Pre-Reading Questions</em> </title>

			<p>
				Previously, we saw that we can control when a function turns ON or OFF by multiplying it by a simple piecewise switch. These switches are actually a special type of function known as the <em>unit step function</em>
				<fn>Also called the <em>Heaviside function</em>.</fn>. Think of it as a mathematical ON-switch that flips from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> at a specific point in time.
			</p>

			<note><title> Saying that a Function is ON or OFF </title>
				<p>
					Throughout this section, we will often use the analogy of a function being ON or OFF. To clarify, when we say 
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<p>
								A unit step function is ON or OFF, we mean it is equal to <m>1</m> or <m>0</m>, respectively.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								A function is ON or OFF, we mean that it is multiplied by <m>1</m> or <m>0</m>, respectively. 
							</p>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</note>

			<p>
				The standard unit step function is denoted <m>u(t)</m>, and is defined as:
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="unit-step-function"><title> Unit Step Function </title>
				<statement>
					<sidebyside widths="50% 7% 36% 7%" valign="middle">
						<p>
							The <em>unit step function</em> <m>u(t)</m> is defined as:
							<me>
								u(t) = \left\{
								\begin{array}{ll}
									1, \amp t \ge 0 \\
									0, \amp \text{otherwise}
								\end{array}
								\right.
							</me>
							It flips from <m>0</m> to <m>1</m> at <m>t = 0</m>.

			</definition>

			<p>
				Since <m>u(t)</m> only takes values of <m>0</m> or <m>1</m>, multiplying a function by <m>u(t)</m> acts as a simple ON-OFF switch. Before <m>t = 0</m>, it kills the function by multiplying it by <m>0</m>. After <m>t = 0</m>, it lets the function pass through.

				The unit step function is the first of several switching tools we'll use to manage functions that activate or deactivate at different times. In the next section, we'll build on this idea to shift the switch to times other than <m>t = 0</m>.

				In the last section, we introduced the unit step function <m>u(t)</m>, which flips from OFF <m>(0)</m> to ON <m>(1)</m> at <m>t = 0</m>. But what if we want the function to turn ON later, say at <m>t = 2</m>, or <m>t = 5</m>, or even <m>t = -3</m>? That's where the <em>shifted</em> unit step function comes in.
			</p>

			<p>
				The shifted unit step function <m>u_c(t)</m> is simply the unit step that switches ON at <m>t = c</m> instead of <m>t = 0</m>. It is defined as:
			</p>

			<assemblage xml:id="shifted-unit-step-function"><title> Shifted Unit Step Function </title>
				<sidebyside widths="62% 4% 30% 4%" valign="top">

					<me>
						u_{-\infty}(t) = 1 \quad\text{and}\quad u_{\infty}(t) = 0 \quad\text{for all } t
					</me>.
					Think about this notation as switch that is always ON and always OFF, respectively.
					<note><title> Notation Clarification </title>
						<p>
							<m>u_c(t)</m> is not a new function, it is just the shorthand for a shifted version of <m>u(t)</m>, where it shifts to the right if <m>c</m> is positive, or to the left if <m>c</m> is negative.
						</p>
					</note>
				</p>
			</assemblage>

			<p>
				Just like before, multiplying a function by <m>u_c(t)</m> turns it ON at <m>t = c</m>. Before <m>t = c</m>, the function is OFF (multiplied by <m>0</m>). After <m>t = c</m>, the function behaves normally.

			<example><title> Multiplying a Function by <m>u_c(t)</m> </title>

				The pattern is now clear: if you want a function to activate at <m>t = c</m>, just multiply it by <m>u_c(t)</m>. This switch-like behavior will be extremely useful when rewriting piecewise functions in a single formula.

				So far, we've used <m>u_c(t)</m> to switch functions ON at <m>t = c</m>. But what if we want the opposite, a switch that turns a function OFF at <m>t = c</m>? For example, a machine that is running initially and shuts off at a certain moment.
			</p>

			<p>
				This reverse behavior can be built using the unit step function itself. Since <m>u_c(t)</m> jumps from 0 to 1 at <m>t = c</m>, we can reverse the switch by subtracting <m>u_c(t)</m> from <m>1</m>. That is:
				<me>
					1 - u_c(t)
				</me>
				turns from ON (<m>1</m>) to OFF (<m>0</m>) at <m>t = c</m>.
			</p>

			<assemblage xml:id="reversed-unit-step"><title> Reversed Unit Step Function </title>

				With both <m>u_c(t)</m> and <m>1 - u_c(t)</m> in hand, you can now switch functions ON or OFF exactly when you need. Next, we will cover the last switch that turns ON functions for a limited window of time, over a finite interval.

				We've seen how to turn a function ON at a certain time using <m>u_c(t)</m>, and how to turn it OFF using <m>1 - u_c(t)</m>. Now let's combine those ideas to create a switch that turns a function ON for a limited interval of time, say, from <m>t = c</m> to <m>t = d</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, you might want a force to activate briefly, or a signal to pulse on for a few seconds. This calls for a function that is:
				<me>
					\left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						1, \amp c \le t \lt d \\
						0, \amp \text{otherwise}
					\end{array}
					\right.
				</me>
				This type of function acts like a window, it's OFF before <m>t = c</m>, ON during the interval <m>[c, d)</m>, and OFF again at <m>t = d</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can build this behavior by subtracting two step functions:
				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>u_c(t)</m> turns ON at <m>t = c</m>.</li>
					<li><m>u_d(t)</m> turns ON at <m>t = d</m>, flipping us back to OFF since we are subtracting.</li>
				</ul>
				So the difference <m>u_c(t) - u_d(t)</m> is the ON-window we need.

				The finite unit step function is the final piece of the puzzle. It lets us precisely control when a function is active, and for how long. In the next section, we'll combine all these ideas to rewrite entire piecewise functions using unit step notation.

				Everything we've done so far has built up to this moment. We now have the tools to rewrite <em>any</em> piecewise-defined function as a single formula using unit step functions. This form is not only compact, it also makes Laplace transforms much easier.
			</p>

			<p>
				To remind you where we started, here's a function (with its <xref ref="intro-piecewise-function" text="custom">graph</xref>) we looked at earlier:

	<subsection><title> Laplace Transform Method with Piecewise Forcing </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Up to this point, our use of the Laplace transform method has focused on differential equations with continuous forcing functions like polynomials, exponentials, or sines. But in real-world systems, especially those involving switching, control, or logic, forcing functions are often <em>piecewise-defined</em>, like the one below:
				<men xml:id="lt-method-w-pw-forcing-intro-eqn">
					y'' + y = 
					\left\{
					\begin{array}{ll}
						2t, \amp 0 \le t \lt 1 \\
						3,  \amp 1 \le t \lt 4 \\
						0,  \amp t \ge 4
					\end{array}
					\right.
				</men>
			</p>

			<p>
				The good news? The 4-step Laplace method still works. The only difference is that, before <em><xref ref="lt-step-1" text="custom">Step 1 of the Laplace Transform Method</xref></em>, you must first convert the piecewise form into its equivalent unit step form, which we just learned how to do. Other than that, the process is the same.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before we can dive into solving these equations, we still need to derive the new rules for transforming a piecewise function. Once we have those, we'll be ready to tackle equations like <xref ref="lt-method-w-pw-forcing-intro-eqn"/>.

					Our current goal is to be able to compute the Laplace transform of both sides of the differential equation,

					In general, we'll first need to convert the piecewise function into its unit-step form. We did this in <xref ref="piecewise-to-step-ex-1"/>, which shows that the equation can be written as

						y'' + y =

				<p>
					You have seen the transforms on the left before, but the right side is new. In general, a piecewise function will contain terms of one of the following forms:
					<me>
						\lap{u_c(t)} \quad\text{and}\quad \lap{f(t)\, u_c(t)} 
					</me>.
					Therefore, we need to derive transform rules for these types of terms.
				</p>
			</introduction>
		
			<paragraphs><title> Laplace Transform of <m>u_c(t)</m> </title>
				<p>
					Let's start with the most basic case, the Laplace transform of a single shifted step function, <m>u_c(t)</m>?
				</p>
			
				<assemblage xml:id="lap-uc"><title> Laplace Transform of <m>u_c(t)</m> </title>
					<p>
						The Laplace transform of the shifted unit step function is given by
						<men xml:id="L13-eqn">
							\lap{u_c(t)} = \frac{e^{-cs}}{s}.
						</men>
					</p>
					<p>
						<theorem><title> <m>\rightarrow \lap{u_c(t)}</m> </title>
							<p>
								To derive this, recall the definition of the Laplace transform:
								<me>
									\lap{u_c(t)} = \int_0^{\infty} u_c(t) \, e^{-st} \, dt.
								</me>
								But remember that
								<me>
									u_c(t) = \left\{
									\begin{array}{ll}
									0, \amp t \lt c\\
									1, \amp t \ge c
									\end{array}
									\right.
								</me>
								So the integrand is zero for <m>t \lt c</m>, and equal to <m>e^{-st}</m> for <m>t \ge c</m>.
							</p>

							<p>
								That simplifies our integral to just the portion from <m>t = c</m> to infinity:
								<me>
									\lap{u_c(t)} = 
									\os{\large t\ \lt\ c}{\overline{\int_0^{c} \ub{u_c(t)}_{=\ 0} \, e^{-st} \, dt}} 
									+ 
									\os{\large t\ \ge\ c}{\overline{\int_c^{\infty} \ub{u_c(t)}_{=\ 1} \, e^{-st} \, dt}}
									= \int_c^{\infty} e^{-st} \, dt
								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								To compute the integral, we have to remember that this is an improper integral, so we re-express it as a limit
								<me>
									\lap{u_c(t)} = \int_c^{\infty} e^{-st} \, dt
									= \lim_{b \to \infty}\int_c^b e^{-st} \, dt
								</me>
								and first compute the integral
								<me>
									\int_c^b e^{-st} \, dt
									= \left[ \frac{-1}{s} e^{-st} \right]_c^b
									= \frac{-1}{s} \left( e^{-sb} - e^{-sc} \right)
									= \frac{e^{-sc}}{s} - \frac{e^{-sb}}{s}.
								</me>
							</p>
							
							<p>
								Now, we compute the limit of this expression as <m>b \to \infty</m>:
								<me>
									\lim_{b \to \infty} \left( \frac{e^{-sc}}{s} - \frac{e^{-sb}}{s} \right)
									= \frac{e^{-sc}}{s} - \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{e^{-sb}}{s}
								</me>.
								As before, the <term>limit of the exponential function</term> converges if its power, <m>-sb</m>, goes to <m>-\infty</m>. This happens if <m>s \gt 0</m>.
							</p>

							<p>
								So, as long as <m>s \gt 0</m>, then <m>\lim_{b \to \infty} e^{-sb} = 0</m> and the transform becomes 
								<me>
									\lap{u_c(t)} = \frac{e^{-cs}}{s}, \quad s \gt 0
								</me>.

				</p>
			
				<assemblage xml:id="laplace-ft-uc"><title> Laplace Transform of <m>f(t)\cdot u_c(t)</m> </title>

						</men>
					</p>

					<p>
						<theorem><title> <m>\rightarrow \lap{f(t) \, u_c(t)}</m> </title>
							<p>
								Let's break this down. By definition:
								<me>
									\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)} = \int_0^\infty f(t)\, u_c(t)\, e^{-st}\, dt.
								</me>
								But since <m>u_c(t) = 0</m> for <m>t \lt c</m>, the integral simplifies to:
								<me>
									\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)} = \int_c^\infty f(t)\, e^{-st}\, dt.
								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								This new integral looks a lot like the Laplace transform of <m>f(t)</m>, but it starts at <m>t = c</m> instead of <m>t = 0</m>. Luckily, we can use a simple <m>u</m>-substitution to create a new variable that starts at <m>t = 0</m>.

					This method works for any piecewise forcing function and now you're ready to use it to solve full differential equations using Laplace transforms.
				</p>
			
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs><title> Forward Transform into the Laplace Domain (Step 1) </title>
				<p>
					When the forcing function <m>g(t)</m> is piecewise-defined, our first task is to rewrite it using unit step functions. This step is crucial, without it, the Laplace transform can't "see" the function properly across its intervals. Once rewritten, we apply the Laplace transform using the rules:
					<men>
						\lap{u_c(t)} = \frac{e^{-cs}}{s}
						\qquad\text{and}\qquad
						\lap{f(t)\cdot u_c(t)} = e^{-cs} \lap{f(t + c)}.
					</men>
				</p>

				<p>
					These rules make it possible to transform any function written in unit step form. If your piecewise function is expressed as a sum of terms like <m>f(t)\, u_c(t)</m>, then each one transforms into <m>e^{-cs} \lap{f(t + c)}</m>. This shift is the key move in Step 1 when dealing with piecewise inputs.

					Now that we've built the Laplace equation, the remaining steps are familiar. We'll solve for <m>Y(s)</m>, simplify, and invert. But there's one twist: the presence of <m>e^{-cs}</m> terms means we'll need special care when taking the inverse Laplace transform. Let's explore that next.

					<p>
						<theorem><title> <m>\rightarrow \lap{f(t - c) \, u_c(t)}</m> </title>

								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								Since <m>u_c(t) = 0</m> for <m>t \lt c</m>, we can change the limits of integration to <m>c\le t\le\infty</m>.

							<p>
								Using a <m>u</m>-substitution, we let <m>u = t - c</m>, so <m>t = u + c</m> and <m>dt = du</m>. The limits change to <m>u = 0</m> and <m>u \to \infty</m>.

					</me>
					you can see that second rule contains the Laplace transform of the function <m>f(t)</m> itself, while the first rule contains the Laplace transform of the shifted function <m>f(t + c)</m>. For this reason, the second rule is used when inverting the transform because inside the Laplace domain, we always solve for <m>F(s)</m>, making it a direct match with the transform table.

							<li>multiply by <m>u_c(t)</m></li>
							<li>replace <m>t</m> with <m>t - c</m></li>
						</ul>
						This shift reflects the fact that the original piece only became active at <m>t = c</m>.
					</p>

					<aside><title> Where this rule comes from </title>
						<p>
							This is the inverse version of the rule:
							<me>\lap{f(t)\, u_c(t)} = e^{-cs} \lap{f(t + c)}.</me>
							What's happening is that multiplying by <m>e^{-cs}</m> delays a signal in the time domain by <m>c</m> units, and multiplies it by a step function to ensure it's zero before <m>t = c</m>.
						</p>
					</aside>
				</assemblage>

				<example><title> Inverse Transform of an Exponential Shift </title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find <m>y(t)</m> if:
							<me>
								Y(s) = e^{-3s} \cdot \frac{2}{s^2 + 9}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>

					<solution> temporarily omitted </solution>
				</example>

				<p>
					This simple rule allows us to invert even complicated-looking expressions like <m>e^{-2s}(s + 1)/(s^2 + 4)</m>. First invert the expression without the exponential, then shift and multiply by <m>u_2(t)</m>.
				</p>

				<example><title> Inverse Transform with Shifting and Sinusoids </title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find <m>f(t)</m> if:
							<me>
								F(s) = e^{-2s} \cdot \frac{s}{s^2 + 4}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>

					<solution> temporarily omitted </solution>
				</example>

				<p>
					As these examples show, returning to the time domain with step functions is just a matter of shifting. In each case:
					<ol>
						<li>Ignore the exponential and find the inverse as usual.</li>
						<li>Replace <m>t</m> with <m>t - c</m>.</li>
						<li>Multiply by <m>u_c(t)</m>.</li>
					</ol>
					This rule works for every exponential shift that came from a <m>u_c(t)</m> factor in the original problem.
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, we'll put everything together and solve full differential equations that involve piecewise forcing functions, from beginning to end.

			<p>
				With these three rules, we can now transform any piecewise function both into and out of the Laplace domain. In the next section, we'll begin applying these rules to solve differential equations with piecewise forcing functions.

					Now that we've seen how to apply the Laplace transform to piecewise forcing functions and how to take inverse transforms of delayed terms, let's walk through a few complete problems. These examples demonstrate how the familiar four-step roadmap extends naturally to piecewise inputs.
				</p>

			<p>
				We are now fully equipped to solve differential equations with a piecewise forcing functions. We will use the same <m>4</m>-step Laplace transform strategy to find <m>y(t)</m> for the following initial value problem:
			</p>

			<paragraphs><title> Strategy Summmary </title>

				<assemblage xml:id="piecewise-laplace-method"><title> Strategy: Solving with Piecewise Forcing </title>
					<p>
						To solve a differential equation with a piecewise forcing function:
						<ol>
							<li>Express the forcing function <m>g(t)</m> using unit step functions.</li>
							<li>Take the Laplace transform using shift rules.</li>
							<li>Solve for <m>Y(s)</m> using algebra.</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Apply inverse Laplace transforms:
									<ol marker="a">
										<li>Invert <m>F(s)</m> as usual</li>
										<li>Replace <m>t</m> with <m>t - c</m> for each exponential shift</li>
										<li>Multiply by <m>u_c(t)</m> to delay the result</li>
									</ol>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</assemblage>

				<p>
					These examples follow the same roadmap you've used all along: transform, solve, prepare, and invert. The only new ingredient is handling piecewise forcing functions with unit step notation. Once that's done, the method proceeds just as before, with a few exponential twists.

				<p>
					Apply <m>\laplacesym</m> to both sides:
					<me>
						\lap{y''} + 4\lap{y} = \lap{g(t)}
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					Using rules <xref ref="L9-eqn" text="custom"><m>L_{9}</m></xref> and <xref ref="L10-eqn" text="custom"><m>L_{10}</m></xref>, the left side becomes:
					<me>
						s^2Y(s) + 4Y(s) = \lap{g(t)}
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					The piecewise function, <m>g(t)</m>, must be rewritten using unit step functions before we can take its transform. Since it has one piece active on <m>1 \le t \lt 2</m>, we can rewrite it as:
					<me>
						g(t) = 1 \cdot (u_1(t) - u_2(t)) \quad \os{\Large<xref ref="L13-eqn" text="custom">L13</xref>}{\implies} \quad \lap{g(t)} = \frac{e^{-s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-2s}}{s}
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					So the Laplace domain equation is:
					<me>
						s^2Y(s) + 4Y(s) = \frac{e^{-s}}{s} - \frac{e^{-2s}}{s}
					</me>.

				</p>

					<me>

					</me>
					so that
					<me>
						Y(s) = F(s)e^{-s} - F(s)e^{-2s}
					</me>
				</p>
				<p>
					This form sets us up perfectly for Step 4. Since that step requires the inverse transform of <m>F(s)</m>, we also need its partial fraction decomposition:
				</p>

				<me>
