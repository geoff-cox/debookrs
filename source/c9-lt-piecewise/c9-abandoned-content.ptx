				<p>
					If a Laplace-domain expression contains an exponential factor <m>e^{-cs}</m>, it corresponds to a  in the time domain:
					<me>
						\ilap{e^{-cs}F(s)} = u_c(t)\cdot f(t - c)
					</me>
					where <m>f(t)</m> is the inverse transform of <m>F(s)</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					This means you take the inverse of the non-exponential part as usual, and then:
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>multiply by <m>u_c(t)</m></li>
						<li>replace <m>t</m> with <m>t - c</m></li>
					</ul>
					This shift reflects the fact that the original piece only became active at <m>t = c</m>.

				<aside><title> Where this rule comes from </title>
					<p>
						This is the inverse version of the rule:
						<me>\lap{f(t)\, u_c(t)} = e^{-cs} \lap{f(t + c)}.</me>
						What's happening is that multiplying by <m>e^{-cs}</m> delays a signal in the time domain by <m>c</m> units, and multiplies it by a step function to ensure it's zero before <m>t = c</m>.
