<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Integrating Factor </title>

	<introduction>

		<p>
			In the previous section, we introduced the idea of solving first-order linear differential equations by manipulating the equation into a form that allows direct integration. This process involved applying a <q>backward</q> product rule to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. However, most equations are not in the form to do this directly. Instead, there is a missing piece, called the <em>integrating factor</em> that is required for transformation to take place and is the focus of this section.

	<introduction>

        <p>
            In the previous section, we explored how reversing the product rule simplifies solving certain differential equations. However, not all equations naturally align with this approach. Many first-order linear differential equations lack a key componentâ€”a function that enables rewriting the left-hand side as a single derivative. This missing piece is called the <em>integrating factor</em>, the focus of this section. Here, we will uncover where the integrating factor comes from and why it works.
        </p>

        <p>
            Understanding the integrating factor is a crucial step before diving into the complete integrating factor method in the next section.
        </p>

    </introduction>

	<subsubsection><title> Incomplete Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			All first-order linear differential equations can be written in the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P y = Q
			</me>
			where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> can be functions of independent variable, <m>x</m>, or constants.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another fact about these equations is the left-side can always be thought of as an incomplete product rule. Meaning that if the equation is provided with the missing piece, the left-side can always be rewritten using the reverse product rule we discussed in the previous section.
		</p>

		<p>
			To see what we mean by an incomplete product rule, imagine you wanted to apply the reverse product rule to the left-side of the differential equation
			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn"> 
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Attempting to label <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as we did in the previous section, we label <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> as <m>g'</m>, but as you can see, there is nothing next to <m>dy/dx</m> for <m>f</m>:
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} ? \ }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2 }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Clearly, something missing, but what is it? Let's imagine multiplying both sides by something and see if we can figure out what this missing piece must be.
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}}}}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}} }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}}
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Looking carefully, the function that we multiply both sides by (labeled <m>f</m>) must have a derivative that is <m>2</m> times the function itself. Only one function has such a property, and that function is <m>e^{2x}</m> <m>\big(\text{since } [e^{2x}]^{\prime} = 2 \cdot e^{2x}\big)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> gives us
			<me>
				e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
			</me>,
			but this is the same equation as in <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"/>, which we know can be rewritten as
			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
			</me>
			and solved using direct integration.
		</p>

		<p>
			To reiterate, every first-order linear differential equation contains an incomplete product rule waiting to be completed by multiplying by some function. In the previous example, it wasn't too difficult to see what the missing piece had to be, but we would like a more systematic way to find it.

	<subsubsection><title> The Missing Piece </title>

		<p>
			In the previous section you saw that we had to multiply both sides of the differential equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> to complete the product rule. However, this was done by inspection and we would like to know how to determine this function in general. To begin, let's go back to the same equation in the previous section,
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
			</me>,
			and recall that we multiplied both sides by some function. Let's call this unknown function, <m>\mu</m> and update the labels to match the variables in the equation, like so 
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5\ \mu
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			All parts of the product rule match perfectly, except for <m>\mu'</m>. Therefore, this product rule is only valid if <m>\mu^{\prime}</m> is equal to <m>2\mu</m>. But this is a differential equation! Namely, it is the first-order separable equation
			<me>
				\mu^{\prime}= 2\mu \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu
			</me>
			with dependent variable, <m>\mu</m>, which can be solved using separation of variables!

			Since any non-zero choice of <m>c</m> will lead to a function that will complete the product rule, we always chose <m>c=1</m>. Thus, confirming that <m>e^{2x}</m> is the piece that our differential equation was missing in order to reverse the product rule.

	 <subsubsection><title> Completing the Product Rule </title>

        <p>
            Recall that a general first-order linear differential equation can be written in the form:
            <me>
                \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x),
            </me>
            where <m>P(x)</m> and <m>Q(x)</m> are functions of the independent variable, <m>x</m>. The left-hand side suggests a resemblance to the product rule, but something is missing to make it a complete derivative. To identify this missing component, consider a simpler example:
        </p>

        <example>
            <title> Identifying the Missing Factor </title>
            <statement>
                Rewrite the left-hand side of the differential equation 
                <me>
                    \frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
                </me>
                as a derivative of a single product, if possible.
            </statement>

            <solution>
                <p>
                    Attempting to rewrite the left-hand side using the reverse product rule, we label <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> as <m>g'</m>. However, no corresponding <m>f</m> exists such that:
                    <md>
                        \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}?}} \cdot \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g'}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}} 
                        + \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f'}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}2}} \cdot \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{\ul{y}} = 5.
                    </md>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The left-hand side lacks the function <m>f</m> that satisfies both parts of the product rule. To resolve this, we hypothesize multiplying the equation by a function <m>\mu(x)</m> that completes the product rule:
                </p>
                <me>
                    \mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + 2 \mu(x) y = 5 \mu(x).
                </me>
                <p>
                    Observing the first term, <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy:
                    <me>
                        \frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \mu,
                    </me>
                    which is a separable differential equation.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>

        <p>
            Solving <m>\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \mu</m> by separation of variables yields:

            To simplify, we set <m>e^c = 1</m> (any non-zero constant would work), leaving <m>\mu(x) = e^{2x}</m>. Multiplying the original equation by this integrating factor completes the product rule:
            <me>
                \frac{d}{dx} \left[e^{2x} y \right] = 5 e^{2x}.

	<subsubsection><title> The Integrating Factor </title>
		<p>
			The missing function we found in the previous section is commonly called the <term>integrating factor</term> and will be denoted by <m>\mu</m>. This factor represents the function that can be multiplied to both sides of a first-order linear differential equation to allow a reverse product rule take place. We found the integrating factor for a specific equation, but the general form of the integrating factor is found in a similar manner.

			To find the integrating factor for the general first-order linear differential equation
			<me>

	<subsubsection><title> The General Integrating Factor </title>

		<p>
			The above example illustrates how an integrating factor transforms a differential equation into a single derivative. For a general first-order linear differential equation:
			<me>
				y' + P(x)y = Q(x),
			</me>
			the integrating factor <m>\mu(x)</m> is derived by solving:
			<me>
				\frac{d\mu}{dx} = P(x) \mu.
			</me>
			Using separation of variables:
			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Multiplying through by <m>\mu(x)</m> gives:
			<me>
				\mu(x) y' + \mu(x) P(x)y = \mu(x) Q(x),
			</me>
			which can be rewritten as:
			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu(x) y \right] = \mu(x) Q(x).
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			The general integrating factor, <m>\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}</m>, is the key to solving first-order linear differential equations. In the next section, we will fully implement this method to solve such equations step by step.
