		In some cases, differential equations can be solved by integrating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable. This approach, which we will refer to as <em>direct integration</em>, requires a specific form that allows integration to "remove" the derivatives from the dependent variable, providing direct access to the solution. Although it is rare to encounter equations that can be approached in this way, it serves as a great starting point for learning the solution process. This section will explain this concept and guide you through your first complete example of solving a differential equation from start to finish.
