		In some cases, differential equations can be solved by simply integrating both sides of the equation with respect to the independent variable. This approach, which we will refer to as <em>direct integration</em>, requires a specific form that permits integration to "remove" the derivative, exposing the dependent variable that it can be isolated.

		Unfortunately, most equations you encounter will not be in such a nice form initially. Nevertheless, this approach serves as a good illustration of what solving a differential equation from start to finish entails.
