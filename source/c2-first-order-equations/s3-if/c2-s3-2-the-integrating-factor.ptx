<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Integrating Factor </title>

	<introduction>
		
		<p>
			The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. Since this rule is at the heart of the method, let's take a moment to review it and see how it helps transform a differential equation into one that can be directly integrated.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the previous section, we introduced the idea of solving first-order linear differential equations by manipulating the equation into a form that allows direct integration. This process involved applying a <q>backward</q> product rule to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. However, most equations are not in the form to do this directly. Instead, there is a missing piece, called the <em>integrating factor</em> that is required for transformation to take place and is the focus of this section.

	<subsubsection><title> Incomplete Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			All first-order linear differential equations can be written in the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P y = Q
			</me>
			where <m>P</m> and <m>Q</m> can be functions of independent variable, <m>x</m>, or constants.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another fact about these equations is the left-side can always be thought of as an incomplete product rule. Meaning that if the equation is provided with the missing piece, the left-side can always be rewritten using the reverse product rule we discussed in the previous section.
		</p>

		<p>
			To see what we mean by an incomplete product rule, imagine you wanted to apply the reverse product rule to the left-side of the differential equation
			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn"> 
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Attempting to label <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as we did in the previous section, we label <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> as <m>g'</m>, but as you can see, there is nothing next to <m>dy/dx</m> for <m>f</m>:

					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2 }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Clearly, something missing, but what is it? Let's imagine multiplying both sides by something and see if we can figure out what this missing piece must be.
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}}}}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}} }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}}
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Looking carefully, the function that we multiply both sides by (labeled <m>f</m>) must have a derivative that is <m>2</m> times the function itself. Only one function has such a property, and that function is <m>e^{2x}</m> <m>\big(\text{since } [e^{2x}]^{\prime} = 2 \cdot e^{2x}\big)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> gives us
			<me>
				e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
			</me>,
			but this is the same equation as in <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"/>, which we know can be rewritten as
			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
			</me>
			and solved using direct integration.
		</p>

		<p>
			To reiterate, every first-order linear differential equation contains an incomplete product rule waiting to be completed by multiplying by some function. In the previous example, it wasn't too difficult to see what the missing piece had to be, but we would like a more systematic way to find it.

	<subsubsection><title> The Missing Piece </title>

		<p>
			In the previous section you saw that we had to multiply both sides of the differential equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> to complete the product rule. However, this was done by inspection and we would like to know how to determine this function in general. To begin, let's go back to the same equation in the previous section,
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
			</me>,
			and recall that we multiplied both sides by some function, <m>\boxed{\phantom{\large|} ? \phantom{\large|}}</m>. Replacing this, the label <m>f</m> with the function, <m>\mu</m>, and the label, <m>g</m>, with <m>y</m>, we have 
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5\ \mu
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			In order for this to be a valid product rule, the derivative of <m>\mu</m> must be <m>2\mu</m>. But this is the first-order separable differential equation
			<me>
				\mu^{\prime}= 2\mu \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu
			</me>
			which can be solved using separation of variables! Let's do that now.

		<p>
			Since any non-zero constant will work, we always chose <m>c=1</m> and we have found the desired function, <m>\mu = e^{2x}</m>, which completes the product rule hidden within every first-order linear differential equation.

	<subsubsection><title> The Integrating Factor </title>

		<p>
			The missing function we found in the previous section is called the <term>integrating factor</term> and will be denoted by <m>\mu</m>. The integrating factor is the function that, when multiplied by the left-side of a first-order linear differential equation, completes the reverse product rule. We found the integrating factor for a specific equation, but the general form of the integrating factor is found in a similar manner.
		</p>

		<p>
			To find the integrating factor for the general first-order linear differential equation
			<me>
				y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
			</me>,
			we multiply both sides by <m>\mu</m>, and label the pieces of the product rule, as before, giving us
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{y'}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} P(x)\ \mu }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ Q(x)\ \mu
				</mrow>
			</md>
			and reason that in order for this to be a valid product rule, we must have
			<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn">
				\mu^{\prime} = P(x)\ \mu
			</men>.
			which can be solved by separation of variables to find <m>\mu</m>, as
			<me>
				\mu = e^{\int P(x)\ dx}
			</me>.
