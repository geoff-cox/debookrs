<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> The Product Rule </title>

	<introduction>
		<p>
			We begin our discussion with a familar concept that lies at the heart of integrating factor methodâ€”the product rule. Recall, the product rule guides you on how to differentiate the product of two functions. In calculus, you start with <m>f(x) \cdot g(x)</m> and use this rule to write the derivative as
			<men xml:id="if-product-rule-calculus-direction">
				\text{(Calculus)}\quad 
				\ub{[f(x) g(x)]'}_{\text{start here}} 
					= \ub{f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x)}_{\text{goal}}
			</men>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The integrating factor (IF) method, on the other hand, aims to use the product rule in reverse direction. That is, it assumes that one side of a differential equation resembles the right side of <xref ref="if-product-rule-calculus-direction"/> and reverts it back into its un-derived state, like so
			<men xml:id="if-product-rule-if-direction">
				\text{(IF Method)}\quad
				\ub{f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x)}_{\text{start here}} = \ub{[f(x) g(x)]'}_{\text{goal}}
			</men>
		</p>

		<p>
			This reversal is the key to this method and can be challenging to grasp in the context of differential equations. Therefore, to ease you into this method, we will start with "reversing" the product rule as independent topic before applying it to differential equations.
		</p>

	<subsubsection><title> Reversing the Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			To get you in the mindset of thinking about the product rule, let's warm-up with a few examples in the forward direction.
		</p>

		<example><title>Forward Product Rule</title>
			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Compute each of the derivatives below.
						<me>
							1. \quad \left[x^6 e^{3x}\right]' \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^3} y(x)\right]
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the <xref ref="if-product-rule-calculus-direction" text="custom"> forward product rule </xref> and simplifying, we have
						<md>
							<mrow>
								\big[ 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{\ln x \vphantom{\frac11}}\ 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{\tan x \vphantom{\frac11}} 
								\big]'	\amp = 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{\ln x \vphantom{\frac11}}\  
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g'}}{\left(\sec^2 x\right) \vphantom{\frac11}} + 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f'}}{\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{\tan x \vphantom{\frac11}}	
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</solution>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the <xref ref="if-product-rule-calculus-direction" text="custom"> forward product rule </xref>, we have
						<md>
							<mrow>
								\big[ 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{x^3 \vphantom{\frac11}}\ 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{\mu(x) \vphantom{\frac11}} 
								\big]'	\amp = 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{x^3 \vphantom{\frac11}}\  
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g'}}{\mu'(x) \vphantom{\frac11}} + 
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{f'}}{\left(3x^2\right) \vphantom{\frac11}}
									\overset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{\mu(x) \vphantom{\frac11}}	
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</p>
		</example>

		<example><title>Backward Product Rule</title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f \cdot g]'</m>.
						<me>
							1. \quad e^{2x} \cos x + 2e^{2x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad y'e^{9x} + 9y e^{9x}
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Trial and error with different combinations of <m>e^x, \sin x, </m> and <m>\cos x</m> inside <m>\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</m> is one approach, but a little thought should lead you to the answer
						<me>
							e^x\cos x + \sin x\ e^x = e^x[\sin x]' + \sin x [e^x]' = [e^x\sin x]'
						</me>.
					</p>
				</solution>

				<solution>
					<p>
						It may help to first rewrite the expression as
						<me>
							\mu \cdot\frac{1}{x} + \mu' \ln x
						</me>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since <m>\mu</m> and <m>\mu'</m> appear in different terms, you know 
						<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</me>
						and since <m>[\ln x]' = 1/x</m>, we must have
						<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \ln x \ \big]'</me>.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</p>

		</example>

		<p>
			Finally, let's see what this looks like on an actual differential equation.
		</p>

		<example>
		
			<p>
				Rewrite the left side of the equation in the form <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}[f \cdot g] </m>.
				<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-02-eq">
					\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
				</men>.
			</p>

			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					As before, noticing <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> in different terms of
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
					</me>
					immediately tells us that the left side can be rewritten as
					<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot y\ \big]' = 3x</me>
					and the observation that <m>[e^{5x^2}]' = 10xe^{5x^2}</m> gives us the other term. Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as
					<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ e^{5x^2} \cdot\ y \big]' = 3x</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Do you see that direct integration can be used here to solve the differential equation?
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<p>
			By understanding how the product rule works in both directions, we can transform a differential equation into one that is easy to solve through integration. This transformation is the core of the integrating factor method, which we will explore next.
