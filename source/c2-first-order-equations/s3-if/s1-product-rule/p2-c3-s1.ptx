<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Product Rule </title>

	<p>
		The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. Since this rule is at the heart of the method, let's take a moment to review it and see how it helps transform a differential equation into one that can be directly integrated.
	</p>

	<p>
		The product rule is used to compute the derivative of a product of two functions. In the context of solving first-order linear differential equations, we use the product rule in reverse to combine terms involving the dependent and independent variables. This allows us to rewrite the equation as the derivative of a product, making integration straightforward. Let's begin by recalling the two directions of the product rule.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are differentiable functions. The product rule states that
		<men xml:id="if-product-rule">
			\underset{\xrightarrow[\LARGE\text{forward}]{} }{\ds [f \cdot g ]'} = 
			\underset{\xleftarrow[\LARGE\text{backward}]{} }{\ds f \cdot g' + f' \cdot g}.
		</men>
		The <q>forward</q> version goes from left to right, while the <q>backward</q> version, which we'll focus on, goes from right to left. Let's practice applying both versions with a few examples.
	</p>

			</ol>
		</p>

	</example>

	<example>

		<p>
			Rewrite each expression in the form <m> [f \cdot g]' </m>.
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						<m>e^x\cos x + \sin x\ e^x = \big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</m>
						<solution><title> Solution </title>
							<p>
								Trial and error with different combinations of <m>e^x, \sin x, </m> and <m>\cos x</m> inside <m>\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</m> is one approach, but a little thought should lead you to the answer
								<me>
									e^x\cos x + \sin x\ e^x = e^x[\sin x]' + \sin x [e^x]' = [e^x\sin x]'
								</me>.

					</p>

				<li>
					<p>
						<m>\ds\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big], \quad</m> where <m>\mu</m> is a function of <m>x</m>.

						<solution><title> Solution </title>
							<p>
								It may help to first rewrite the expression as
								<me>
									\mu \cdot\frac{1}{x} + \mu' \ln x
								</me>.
							</p>
							<p>
								Since <m>\mu</m> and <m>\mu'</m> appear in different terms, you know 
								<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}}\ \big]'</me>
								and since <m>[\ln x]' = 1/x</m>, we must have
								<me>\frac{\mu}{x} + \mu' \ln x = \big[\ \mu \cdot \ln x \ \big]'</me>.
							</p>
						</solution>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>

	</example>

	<p>
		Finally, let's see what this looks like on an actual differential equation.
	</p>

	<example>
	
		<p>
			Rewrite the left side of the equation in the form <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}[f \cdot g] </m>.
			<men xml:id="example-if-product-rule-reverse-02-eq">
				\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
			</men>.
		</p>

		<solution><title> Solution </title>
			<p>
				As before, noticing <m>y</m> and <m>dy/dx</m> in different terms of
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} \cdot e^{5x^2} + 10xe^{5x^2}\cdot y = 3x
				</me>
				immediately tells us that the left side can be rewritten as
				<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \us{?}{\ul{\qquad}} \cdot y\ \big]' = 3x</me>
				and the observation that <m>[e^{5x^2}]' = 10xe^{5x^2}</m> gives us the other term. Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as
				<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ e^{5x^2} \cdot\ y \big]' = 3x</me>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Do you see that direct integration can be used here to solve the differential equation?
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		By understanding how the product rule works in both directions, we can transform a differential equation into one that is easy to solve through integration. This transformation is the core of the integrating factor method, which we will explore next.
