			<statement>
				<p>What is the main purpose of an integrating factor in solving first-order linear differential equations?</p>
			</statement>
			<choices>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>To transform the equation into one that can be solved using the backward product rule.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>
							Correct! The integrating factor allows us to manipulate the equation so that it becomes a perfect derivative, which can then be integrated directly.
						</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>To simplify the coefficients of the equation.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>
							Not quite. While the integrating factor simplifies the process, its primary goal is to enable the use of the backward product rule, not to simplify the coefficients directly.
						</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>To eliminate the constant term from the differential equation.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>
							Incorrect. The integrating factor is used to transform the equation into a solvable form, not to remove constant terms.
						</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>To reduce the equation to a second-order differential equation.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>
							Incorrect. The integrating factor helps solve first-order differential equations, not reduce them to second-order equations.

					Which differential equation do you solve to find the integrating factor,<m>\mu</m>, for the first-order linear equation 
					<me>y' + \frac{y}{x} = \sin x</me>?
				</p>
			</statement>

		<exercise label="p2-c3-s2-rq3"><title> <em>What form does the first-order linear differential equation take after multiplying by the integrating factor?</em> </title>
			<statement>
				<p>After multiplying both sides of a first-order linear differential equation by the integrating factor, the equation takes the form:</p>
			</statement>
			<choices>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement> <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}\left[\mu \cdot y\right] = \mu Q(x)</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Correct! Multiplying by the integrating factor transforms the equation into this form.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx} \left[ y \right] = P(x) \mu Q(x)</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. The correct form is <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}\left[\mu(x) \cdot y\right] = \mu(x)Q(x)</m>.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx} \left[ y \right] + P(x)y = Q(x)</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. This is the form of the original equation before multiplying by the integrating factor.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\mu \cdot y = Q(x) \cdot \frac{dy}{dx}</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. This form does not represent the transformed equation after multiplying by the integrating factor.</p>
					</feedback>

		<exercise label="p2-c3-s2-rq4"><title> <em>What is the integrating factor for the equation <m> y' + 3y = e^x</m>?</em> </title>
			<statement>
				<p>Find the integrating factor for the equation <m>y' + 3y = e^x</m>.</p>
			</statement>
			<choices>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\mu = e^{e^{3x}}</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. This is not the correct expression for the integrating factor.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement> <m>\mu = e^{3x}</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Correct! The integrating factor is <m>e^{3x}</m>.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\mu = e^{x^2/2}</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. The correct integrating factor should involve the integral of the coefficient of <m>y</m>, which is <m>3</m>, not <m>x</m>.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement> <m>\ds\mu = e^{x}</m> </statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. This is not the correct form for the integrating factor.</p>

		<exercise label="p2-c3-s2-rq5"><title> <em>If we solve a differential equation to find the integrating factor, then why doesn't it contain an integration constant?</em> </title>
			<statement>
				<p>When solving a differential equation to find the integrating factor, why is there no constant of integration in the solution?</p>
			</statement>
			<choices>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>Since any value of this constant would give a valid integrating factor, we set the constant to the simplest value.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Correct! The integrating factor is used to multiply both sides of the equation, and any constant would cancel out during this process, making the constant irrelevant.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Because the integrating factor must be a specific function with no additional constants.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. The integrating factor is determined by the form of the differential equation, but the lack of a constant is not because it must be a specific functionâ€”it's because any constant would cancel out when multiplying both sides.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Because the integrating factor equation doesn't have an initial condition.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. Although the integrating factor equation doesn't have an initial condition, this is not the reason it does not have one.</p>
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>Because the constant of integration is already included in the solution for <m>y</m>.</statement>
					<feedback>
						<p>Incorrect. The constant of integration appears in the final solution for <m>y</m>, but it is not related to why the integrating factor does not include a constant.</p>
					</feedback>
