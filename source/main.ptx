					Differential equations are the foundation of mathematical modeling. Whether it's the motion of planets, the spread of a virus, or the flow of electricity, these equations provide a means to connect what we know about a system to how it will evolve over time or space. This chapter serves as your starting point for understanding why differential equations matter and how they're built.
				</p>

				<p>
					We'll begin with the essential question: <q>What exactly is a differential equation?</q> From there, we'll break the concept into manageable pieces: learning the vocabulary and identifying key components such as terms and coefficients. These ideas form the language that the rest of the book will speak.

					A central goal in differential equations is learning how to find their solutions. In fact, most problems you'll encounter begin with a familiar prompt:
				</p>

				<p>
					<blockquote>
						<em><q>Find the solution to the following differential equation.</q></em>
					</blockquote>
					This "solve and move on" mindset can sometimes obscure a deeper, more important question:
					<blockquote>
						<em><q>What does it actually mean to be a solution to a differential equation?</q></em>
					</blockquote>
				</p>

				<p>
					In algebra, a solution is any <em>value</em> that <q>satisfies</q> the algebraic equation. In contrast, a solution to a differential equation is any <em>function</em> that <q>satisfies</q> the differential equation. Understanding what it means for a function to satisfy a differential equation is the first step toward understanding its solutions.

				<p>
					When a differential equation is both <em>first-order</em> and <em>separable</em>, we can reliably find its general solution using the <em>separation of variables</em> method. At its core, this technique involves rewriting the equation so that all <m>y</m> terms are grouped on one side and all <m>x</m> terms on the other. Once the two sides are separated, integrating them yields the general solution.
				</p>

				<p>
					Once you verify that the <em>separation of variables</em> method applies, the strategy can be summarized by a 3-step workflow:
				</p>

				<sidebyside width="96%">
					<p>
						Separate the <m>x</m> &amp; <m>y</m> variables ➜ Integrate the separated equation ➜ Isolate <m>y</m>.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<p>
					This chapter guides you through this process, starting with what it means for an equation to be separable and finishing with how to find the general solution.

				<p>
					Not every differential equation will politely separate its variables for us. For first-order linear equations, there's another powerful tool: the <em>integrating factor method</em>. This method works by multiplying the entire equation by a carefully chosen function—an <q>integrating factor</q>—that transforms the left side into a single derivative.
				</p>

				<p>
					Here's the intuition: Every equation of the form
					<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)</me>
					can be multiplied by a special factor to give you
					<me>\boxed{\phantom{M}}\cdot \frac{dy}{dx} + \ \boxed{\phantom{M}}\cdot P(x)y = \ \boxed{\phantom{M}}\cdot Q(x)</me>
					and the whole left side bcomes a single derivative:
					<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\ \boxed{\phantom{M}}\cdot y\big] =\ \boxed{\phantom{M}}\cdot Q(x).</me>
					From here, the equation is solved with <xref ref="di-method" text="custom">direct integration</xref>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The goal of this chapter, is to learn where this mysterious factor comes from, how to find it, and how to use it to solve any first-order linear differential equation.

					Finding a neat <q>formula-like</q> solution to a differential equation is the ultimate goal, but many equations can't be solved that way due to complexity or non-existence of solutions. Instead, we use <term>qualitative methods</term> to understand how solutions behave <em>without</em> providing explicit solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					These methods shift the focus from <q>What's the exact formula?</q> to <q>What does the solution actually <em>do</em>?</q> They reveal whether solutions rise or fall, where they level off, and how they respond to different initial conditions—all through the equation's structure.
				</p>

				<p>
					An <em>analytic</em> solution like <m>y(t) = Ce^{2t}</m> gives a precise expression, a <em>qualitative</em> approach outlines the shape, tendencies, and long-term trends of the solution. Both perspectives are valuable, with qualitative tools becoming essential when analytic methods fail.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, you'll learn to analyze the behavior of solutions through slope fields, phase lines, and bifurcation diagrams. By the end, you'll be able to interpret a differential equation without needing to find a specific solution formula.

			<title>Euler's Method</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Not every differential equation gives up its secrets to pencil-and-paper methods. Some are too complicated to solve exactly; others have solutions so messy they're practically useless. That's where <em>numerical methods</em> come in—techniques for building approximate solutions when analytic ones aren't possible.
				</p>

				<p>
					To give you an idea of how easily solutions get out of hand, meet the Riccati equation:
					<men xml:id="riccati-eqn">
						y' = y^2 - x
					</men>.
					It appears relatively tame, but the nonlinear term <m>y^2</m> makes solving it substantially more challenging. An exact solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> exists, but it ain't pretty as you can see below.
				</p>

				<proof component="web"><title>🫣 Solution to the Riccati Equation</title>
					<p>
						The solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is described by
						<me component="web">
							😱\quad y = \frac{ 3 x \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{4}{3}} \left( x \right) - c_1 J_{\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) + 2 J_{-\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) \right) + 2 c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}}\left( x \right) }{ (12 x)^{2/3} \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}} \left( x \right) + J_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(x \right) \right)}

						where <m>J_n(x)</m> denotes a Bessel function defined as
						<me>
							J_n( x ) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \ \Gamma(m + n + 1)}\left( \frac{i}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^{2m + n}
						</me>
					</p>
				</proof>
 
				<p>
					In this chapter, we'll explore what it means to approximate a solution and why doing so is often the only practical choice. We'll cover Euler's method, a simple but powerful idea that moves step by step along the solution curve.
				</p>

				<p>
					Along the way, we'll confront an important truth: many differential equations simply cannot be expressed in neat <q>closed form.</q> But we're not helpless—we can <q>trade</q> the exact solution for an approximate one that's good enough for analysis, prediction, and real-world applications. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the thinking behind numerical methods and be ready to start building these approximations yourself.

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Stepping beyond first-order problems, we turn to equations involving higher derivatives—especially the important class of linear equations with constant coefficients. This chapter explains why these equations are so useful and how systematic methods yield powerful, general solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					Up to this point, we've focused mostly on first-order equations. Now it's time to take the next step: equations involving second derivatives and beyond. Among these, one class stands out for its importance and simplicity—the <em>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</em> (often shortened to LHCC equations).
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, we'll pin down exactly what those words mean: <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Then we'll discover why exponential functions are the natural <q>building blocks</q> for their solutions, and how the <em>characteristic equation</em> turns a differential equation into an algebra problem we can solve systematically.
				</p>

				<p>
					By the end, you'll have a clear strategy for solving LHCC equations of any order—a foundation that will carry directly into the next chapter, where we'll look at what happens when these equations are no longer homogeneous.

			<title>Nonhomogeneous Equations (LNCC)</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					In the last chapter, we studied <em>linear homogeneous constant coefficient</em> (LHCC) equations—problems where the right-hand side was always zero. Their solutions were obtained entirely from exponential functions determined by the characteristic equation.
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we take the next step: <em>linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient</em> (LNCC) equations. These look similar, but with one crucial change—there's a non-zero function on the right-hand side, called the <em>forcing function</em>. This function represents whatever drives or influences the system: an external force, an input, a signal, or another effect.
				</p>

				<p>
					Solving these equations involves blending two ideas. First, we find the <em>homogeneous solution</em>, which behaves just like the solutions from the previous chapter. Then we construct a <em>particular solution</em> that accounts for the forcing function. Add them together, and you have the <em>general solution</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, we'll learn how to recognize that structure and then develop a powerful tool—the <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em>—to systematically build the particular solution. This will open the door to solving a huge range of real-world problems.

			<title>Laplace Transforms</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The Laplace transform opens a new path for solving differential equations: it turns calculus problems into algebra problems, handles initial conditions seamlessly, and works beautifully with inputs that turn on, off, or switch over time. This part builds the method step by step.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					The Laplace transform is one of the most powerful tools for solving differential equations—and one of the most surprising. Instead of directly working with derivatives, we temporarily reformulate the problem in a new setting called the <em>Laplace domain</em>. In that space, derivatives turn into algebraic terms, and the differential equation becomes something much friendlier: an algebraic equation for a new unknown, <m>Y(s)</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The real magic is that once we solve for <m>Y(s)</m>, we can <q>come back</q> by applying the inverse Laplace transform and recover <m>y(t)</m>, the solution to the original problem. Along the way, initial conditions fold neatly into the process, and tricky features like discontinuous inputs become far easier to handle.
				</p>

				<p>
					This chapter lays the foundation for all Laplace-related material. We'll define the Laplace transform from scratch, explore why it works, and build a library of key transforms and properties. With those tools in hand, we'll be ready to use the Laplace method to solve differential equations in the chapters ahead.

			<title>Piecewise Forcing Functions</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Real-world systems rarely behave with smooth, unbroken motion. Machines switch on, circuits reset, and forces might act for only a moment before stopping. These situations call for <em>piecewise functions</em>—functions defined by different rules over different time intervals.
				</p>

				<p>
					When piecewise functions appear as the <q>inputs</q> or forcing terms in a differential equation, the Laplace transform method is still up to the task—but we need one more tool: the <em>unit step function</em>. This mathematical ON–OFF switch allows us to rewrite piecewise functions into a single, concise expression.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, you'll learn how to express any piecewise function using unit step notation, how to handle different types of switches (turning on, turning off, or staying on for just a window of time), and how to apply special Laplace transform rules for step functions. By the end, you'll be able to solve differential equations with inputs that start, stop, and change just like the systems they model.

			<title>First-Order Linear Systems</title>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					Many real-world problems involve several quantities changing together. This section introduces systems of differential equations, starting with linear systems and progressing to nonlinear ones, providing tools to understand and analyze how multiple variables interact dynamically.
				</p>

				<p>
					Up to now, we've mostly dealt with differential equations one at a time—one equation, one unknown function. But many real-world situations don't work that way. Populations interact, chemicals react, and mechanical parts move together. To describe these systems, we need more than a single equation—we need a <em>system</em> of differential equations.
				</p>

				<p>
					A system is simply a collection of differential equations that must be solved together because their unknowns are linked. Some systems are <q>uncoupled,</q> meaning that each equation can be solved independently. Others are <q>coupled,</q> where the variables feed into each other's equations and evolve together.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this chapter, we'll build the foundations for working with systems. We'll start by looking at simple cases, then move into coupled systems and see how tools like the <em>phase plane</em> help us visualize the relationships between variables. By the end, you'll have the groundwork needed to understand and solve first-order linear systems.

			<introduction>

				</p>

				<p>
					Linear systems give us a structured, predictable world—but the real world is rarely that neat. Most systems in nature are <em>nonlinear</em>: predator-prey populations affect each other in complex ways, economic models spiral or stabilize depending on feedback loops, and mechanical systems exhibit unexpected behavior when forces become too large.
				</p>

				<p>
					Nonlinear systems bring both challenges and fascination. They can behave in ways linear systems never will—showing sudden jumps, oscillations, or even chaotic motion. Traditional algebraic tools often fall short here, so we rely more heavily on qualitative analysis, numerical methods, and geometric thinking to make sense of what's happening.
				</p>

				<p>
					This chapter introduces the core ideas you'll need to begin exploring nonlinear systems. While the techniques are more limited and the solutions less tidy, the insights they reveal are essential for understanding the complex, interconnected systems that define much of the world around us.
