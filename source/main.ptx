				Differential equations sit at the heart of how we describe change. Whether we're tracking the spread of a disease, predicting the motion of a planet, or modeling the charge in an electrical circuit, differential equations provide the language and the structure to make sense of how systems evolve. They connect the algebra you already know with the calculus you've learned, and they open the door to ideas that reach across science, engineering, and beyond.
			</p>

			<p>
				This book is designed to guide you through that world step by step. We begin with the basics‚Äîwhat a differential equation is, how to classify it, and what it means to solve one. From there, we explore the core solution methods for first-order equations, building intuition before stepping into more advanced territory like higher-order equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of equations. Along the way, you'll see not only <em>how</em> to solve different types of problems, but also <em>why</em> the methods work and when each tool is the right one to use.
			</p>

			<p>
				But not every equation has a neat solution you can write down. That's why this book also covers <em>qualitative methods</em> for understanding solution behavior, and <em>numerical methods</em> for approximating solutions when analytic ones aren't available. These approaches shift the focus to the bigger picture: what the solutions mean, how they behave, and what they tell us about the systems they describe.
			</p>

			<p>
				Above all, this book aims to stay approachable and conversational. You'll find worked examples, visual tools, and quick-reference summaries to help you along the way. Whether you are here as a mathematician, an engineer, a scientist, or simply someone curious about how mathematics explains the world, this book will help you not just solve differential equations, but truly understand them.

						Differential equations are the foundation of mathematical modeling‚Äîthe tools we use to describe how things change. Whether it's the motion of planets, the spread of a virus, or the flow of electricity, these equations give us a way to connect what we know about a system to how it will evolve over time or space. This chapter serves as your starting point for understanding why differential equations matter and how they're built.
					</p>

					<p>
						We'll begin with the essential question: <q>What exactly is a differential equation?</q> From there, we'll break the concept into manageable pieces‚Äîlearning the vocabulary, identifying key components like terms and coefficients, and understanding how equations are classified by order and linearity. These ideas form the language that the rest of the book will speak.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the end of this chapter, you'll be able to look at an unfamiliar equation and recognize what makes it a differential equation, describe its structure, and understand the basic categories it might belong to. This foundation will support every method and concept that comes next.

					<p>
						Solving a differential equation isn't just about crunching numbers‚Äîit's about finding a function that makes the equation true. In this chapter, we'll explore what it really means for something to be a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù to a differential equation and why that idea is more subtle (and more powerful) than it might first appear.
					</p>

					<p>
						We'll look at different kinds of solutions‚Äîgeneral solutions, which describe an entire family of possibilities, and particular solutions, which pin down a single curve using initial conditions. Along the way, we'll see how integration, one of the main tools from calculus, becomes our first method for actually solving a simple differential equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the time you finish this chapter, you'll be able to test whether a function is truly a solution, describe the different types of solutions we use, and solve the simplest cases by integrating. These skills will become the groundwork for every solving technique that follows.

			<title>First-Order Differential Equations</title> 

			<introduction>
				<p>
					First-order equations are where most journeys in differential equations begin. Here we'll explore core solution methods, see when and why they work, and build intuition with qualitative and numerical approaches that reveal how solutions behave even when formulas aren't available.

			<chapter label="separable-variables-method">
				<title>Separation of Variables</title>
				
				<introduction>
					<p>
						This chapter covers a solution technique called <em>separation of variables</em>, a powerful tool for solving first order differential equations that can be rearranged in a form where the independent and dependent variables can be isolated on opposite sides of the equation. In this new form, the general solution can be obtained by integrating both sides of the equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we will learn to identify when it is possible to put an equation in this special form and delve into the separation of variables process that leads to the general solution.

				<title>Integrating Factor</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Not every differential equation will politely separate its variables for us. For first-order linear equations, there's another powerful tool: the <em>integrating factor method</em>. This method works by multiplying the entire equation by a carefully chosen function‚Äîan ‚Äúintegrating factor‚Äù‚Äîthat transforms the left side into something much easier to handle: the derivative of a single product.
					</p>

					<p>
						Here's the intuition: if you start with an equation like
						<me>\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x),</me>
						there's a function <m>\mu(x)</m> you can multiply through by to make the left-hand side ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù into
						<me>\frac{d}{dx}\big[\mu(x) y\big] = \mu(x) Q(x).</me>
						That small algebraic trick opens the door to solving the equation directly by integration.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we'll learn where this mysterious integrating factor comes from, how to find it every time, and how to use it to solve any first-order linear differential equation. By the end, you'll have a systematic three-step process for tackling a huge class of problems.

				<title>Qualitative Methods</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Finding a neat <q>formula-like</q> solution to a differential equation feels like the ultimate goal. But in reality, many important equations simply can't be solved that way. The solutions may be too complicated, or they don't exist at all. That doesn't mean we're stuck. Instead, we turn to <term>qualitative methods</term>, a collection of tools for understanding how solutions behave <em>without</em> solving for them explicitly.
					</p>

					<p>
						Qualitative methods change the question. Instead of asking, <q>What's the exact formula?</q> we ask, <q>What does the solution actually <em>do</em>?</q> These methods help us see whether solutions rise or fall, where they level off, and how they respond to different initial conditions‚Äîjust by examining the equation's structure.
					</p>

					<p>
						An <em>analytic</em> solution gives a precise expression, like <m>y(t) = Ce^{2t}</m>. A <em>qualitative</em> approach, by contrast, describes the shape, tendencies, and long-term trends of the solution without pinning it down to an exact formula. Both perspectives are valuable, but qualitative tools become essential when analytic methods hit their limits.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, you'll learn to read the behavior of solutions from the equation itself using slope fields, phase lines, and bifurcation diagrams. By the end, you'll be able to look at a differential equation like <me>\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t, y)</me> and describe what's happening‚Äîeven if you never write down a single solution formula.

				<title>Numerical Methods</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Not every differential equation gives up its secrets to pencil-and-paper methods. Some are too complicated to solve exactly; others have solutions so messy they're practically useless. That's where <em>numerical methods</em> come in‚Äîtechniques for building approximate solutions when analytic ones aren't possible.
					</p>

					<p>
						To give you an idea of how easily solutions get out of hand, meet the riccati equation:
						<men xml:id="riccati-eqn">
							y' = y^2 - x
						</men>.
						It seems relatively tame, but the nonlinear term, <m>y^2</m>, makes solving it substantially more challenging. An exact solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> exists, but it ain't pretty as you can see below.
					</p>

					<proof component="web"><title>ü´£ Solution to the Riccati Equation</title>
						<p>
							The solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is described by
							<me component="web">
								üò±\quad y = \frac{ 3 x \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{4}{3}} \left( x \right) - c_1 J_{\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) + 2 J_{-\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) \right) + 2 c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}}\left( x \right) }{ (12 x)^{2/3} \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}} \left( x \right) + J_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(x \right) \right)}  
							</me>
							where <m>J_n(x)</m> denotes a Bessel function defined as
							<me>
								J_n( x ) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \ \Gamma(m + n + 1)}\left( \frac{i}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^{2m + n}
							</me>
						</p>
					</proof>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we'll explore what it means to approximate a solution and why doing so is often the only practical choice. We'll start with Euler's method, a simple but powerful idea that moves step by step along the solution curve. From there, we'll peek ahead to more advanced algorithms, like the Runge‚ÄìKutta methods, which computers use to tackle even tougher problems.
					</p>

					<p>
						Along the way, we'll confront an important truth: many differential equations simply cannot be expressed in neat ‚Äúclosed form.‚Äù But we're not helpless‚Äîwe can <q>trade</q> the exact solution for an approximate one that's good enough for analysis, prediction, and real-world applications. By the end of this chapter, you'll understand the thinking behind numerical methods and be ready to start building these approximations yourself.

			<title>Linear Equations With Constant Coefficients</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					Stepping beyond first-order problems, we turn to equations involving higher derivatives‚Äîespecially the important class of linear equations with constant coefficients. This part shows why these equations are so useful, and how systematic methods lead to powerful, general solutions.
				</p>

				<title>Homogeneous Equations</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Up to this point, we've focused mostly on first-order equations. Now it's time to take the next step: equations involving second derivatives and beyond. Among these, one class stands out for its importance and simplicity‚Äîthe <em>linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients</em> (often shortened to LHCC equations).
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we'll pin down exactly what those words mean: <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficient</em>. Then we'll discover why exponential functions are the natural ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù for their solutions, and how the <em>characteristic equation</em> turns a differential equation into an algebra problem we can solve systematically.
					</p>

					<p>
						By the end, you'll have a clear strategy for solving LHCC equations of any order‚Äîa foundation that will carry directly into the next chapter, where we'll look at what happens when these equations are no longer homogeneous.

			<chapter label="undetermined-coefficients">
				<title>Nonhomogeneous Equations</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						In the last chapter, we studied <em>linear homogeneous constant coefficient</em> (LHCC) equations‚Äîproblems where the right-hand side was always zero. Their solutions came entirely from exponential functions uncovered by the characteristic equation.
					</p>

					<p>
						Now we take the next step: <em>linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient</em> (LNCC) equations. These look similar, but with one crucial change‚Äîthere's a non-zero function on the right-hand side, called the <em>forcing function</em>. This function represents whatever is driving or influencing the system: an external force, an input, a signal, or some other effect.
					</p>

					<p>
						Solving these equations involves blending two ideas. First, we find the <em>homogeneous solution</em>, which behaves just like the solutions from the previous chapter. Then we construct a <em>particular solution</em> that accounts for the forcing function. Add them together, and you have the <em>general solution</em>.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we'll learn how to recognize that structure and then develop a powerful tool‚Äîthe <em>Method of Undetermined Coefficients</em>‚Äîto systematically build the particular solution. This will open the door to solving a huge range of real-world problems.

			<title>The Laplace Transform Method</title>

			<introduction>
				<p>
					The Laplace transform opens a new path for solving differential equations: it turns calculus problems into algebra problems, handles initial conditions seamlessly, and works beautifully with inputs that turn on, off, or switch over time. This part builds the method step by step.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<chapter label="laplace-transforms">
				<title>The Laplace Transform</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						The Laplace transform is one of the most powerful tools for solving differential equations‚Äîand one of the most surprising. Instead of wrestling with derivatives directly, we temporarily move the problem into a new setting called the <em>Laplace domain</em>. In that space, derivatives turn into algebraic terms, and the differential equation becomes something much friendlier: an algebraic equation for a new unknown, <m>Y(s)</m>.
					</p>

					<p>
						The real magic is that once we solve for <m>Y(s)</m>, we can ‚Äúcome back‚Äù by applying the inverse Laplace transform and recover <m>y(t)</m>, the solution to the original problem. Along the way, initial conditions fold neatly into the process, and tricky features like discontinuous inputs become far easier to handle.
					</p>

					<p>
						This chapter lays the foundation for everything Laplace-related. We'll define the Laplace transform from scratch, explore why it works, and build a library of key transforms and properties. With those tools in hand, we'll be ready to use the Laplace method to solve differential equations in the chapters ahead.

				<title>Laplace Method for Piecewise Functions</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Real-world systems rarely behave in one smooth, unbroken motion. Machines switch on, circuits reset, and forces might act for only a moment before stopping. These situations call for <em>piecewise functions</em>‚Äîfunctions defined by different rules over different time intervals.
					</p>

					<p>
						When piecewise functions appear as the ‚Äúinputs‚Äù or forcing terms in a differential equation, the Laplace transform method is still up to the task‚Äîbut we need one more tool: the <em>unit step function</em>. This mathematical ON‚ÄìOFF switch lets us rewrite piecewise functions into a single, clean expression.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, you'll learn how to express any piecewise function using unit step notation, how to handle different types of switches (turning on, turning off, or staying on for just a window of time), and how to apply special Laplace transform rules for step functions. By the end, you'll be able to solve differential equations with inputs that start, stop, and change just like the systems they model.

			<title>Systems of Differential Equations</title>

			<introduction label="part4-intro">
				<p>
					Many real-world problems involve several quantities changing together. This part introduces systems of differential equations, starting with linear systems and moving toward nonlinear ones, giving you tools to understand and analyze how multiple variables interact dynamically.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<chapter><title>First-Order Linear Systems</title>

				<introduction>
					<p>
						Up to now, we've mostly dealt with differential equations one at a time‚Äîone equation, one unknown function. But many real-world situations don't work that way. Populations interact, chemicals react, and mechanical parts move together. To describe these systems, we need more than a single equation‚Äîwe need a <em>system</em> of differential equations.
					</p>

					<p>
						A system is simply a collection of differential equations that must be solved together because their unknowns are linked. Some systems are ‚Äúuncoupled,‚Äù meaning each equation can be solved on its own. Others are ‚Äúcoupled,‚Äù where the variables feed into each other's equations and evolve together.
					</p>

					<p>
						In this chapter, we'll build the foundations for working with systems. We'll start by looking at simple cases, then move into coupled systems and see how tools like the <em>phase plane</em> help us visualize the relationships between variables. By the end, you'll have the groundwork needed to understand and solve first-order linear systems.

			<chapter><title>Nonlinear Systems</title>
				<introduction>
					<p>
						<xref provisional="FUTURE-WORK"/>
					</p>

					<p>
						Linear systems give us a structured, predictable world‚Äîbut the real world is rarely that neat. Most systems in nature are <em>nonlinear</em>: predator and prey populations affect each other in complex ways, economic models spiral or stabilize depending on feedback loops, and mechanical systems exhibit unexpected behavior when forces get too large.
					</p>

					<p>
						Nonlinear systems bring both challenges and fascination. They can behave in ways linear systems never will‚Äîshowing sudden jumps, oscillations, or even chaotic motion. Traditional algebraic tools often fall short here, so we rely more heavily on qualitative analysis, numerical methods, and geometric thinking to make sense of what's happening.
					</p>

					<p>
						This chapter introduces the core ideas you'll need to begin exploring nonlinear systems. While the techniques are more limited and the solutions less tidy, the insights they reveal are essential for understanding the complex, interconnected systems that define much of the world around us.
