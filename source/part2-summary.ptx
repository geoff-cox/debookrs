							<p>
								Every first-order differential equation can be written in the form
								<me>
									f(x, y, y') = 0
								</me>.
								This just means that all the terms in the equation have been moved to the left-hand side, which can only contain the independent variable, <m>x</m>, the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, and its derivative, <m>y'</m>.

							<p>

						<li xml:id="p1-summary-integrating-factor"><title> Integrating Factor </title>

			<exercise>
				<statement>
					<m> \ds x^2 \frac{dy}{dx} + \cos x = y </m>
					<p/>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					This DE is first order and linear, so it can be solved using an integrating factor.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is not separable because when we solve for the derivative,
						<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{y - \cos x}{x^2}, </me>
					we see that there is no way to separate the variables on the right hand side via
					multiplication.
					</p>
					<p>
					Therefore, this DE can be solved using an integrating factor, but not by
					separating variables.

			<exercise>
				<statement>
					<m> \ds \frac{dx}{dt} + xt = e^x </m>
					<p/>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					This DE is first order but it is not linear (because the dependent variable, <m>x</m>, appears inside a function--in the <m>e^x</m> term), so it cannot be solved using an integrating factor.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is not separable because when we solve for the derivative,
								<me> \frac{dx}{dt} = e^x - xt, </me>
					we see that there is no way to separate the variables on the right hand side via multiplication.
					</p>
					<p>
					Therefore, this DE cannot be solved using either technique.

					<p>
					This DE is first order and linear, so it can be solved using an integrating factor.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is separable, as shown: because when we solve for the derivative,
						<md>
							<mrow> (t^2 + 1) \frac{dy}{dt}	\amp = yt - y </mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}						\amp = \frac{yt - y}{t^2+1} </mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}						\amp = \frac{y(t - 1)}{t^2+1} </mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}						\amp = y\cdot \frac{t - 1}{t^2+1}, </mrow>
						</md>
					we see that we can separate the variables on the right hand side via multiplication.

			<exercise>
				<statement>
					<m> \ds \frac{dy}{dt} - y^2 t = t </m>
					<p/>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					This DE is first order but it is not linear (because the dependent variable, <m>y</m>, is raised
					to a power--in the <m>y^2</m> term), so it cannot be solved using an integrating factor.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is separable, as shown: because when we solve for the derivative,
						<md>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt} - y^2 t 	\amp = t </mrow>
							<mrow> \frac{dy}{dt}					\amp = t + y^2 t </mrow>

						</md>
					we see that we can separate the variables on the right hand side via multiplication.

			<exercise>
				<statement>
					<m> \ds 3r = \frac{dr}{d\theta} - \theta^3 </m>
					<p/>
				</statement>
				<solution>
					<p>
					This DE is first order and linear, so it can be solved using an integrating factor.
					</p>
					<p>
					It is not separable because when we solve for the derivative,
