		Picture yourself in a library filled with thousands of books. To locate the book you're looking for, you need to understand how they're organized. In the same way that a library organizes books by genre, author, or subject, we classify differential equations to understand them and figure out how to solve them. Understanding how to group differential equations is important for choosing the most effective methods to solve them.

		As you go through this text, you will learn about a variety of methods for solving differential equations. Selecting the right method will depend on specific features or properties of the differential equation. This process of categorization, known as <em>classification</em>, is the first step before diving into the techniques for solving differential equations.

		By classifying differential equations by their order, we can better organize our approach to solving them. This initial step is crucial because it sets the stage for selecting the right tools and methods to find solutions effectively.

		To illustrate why classification is important, think about solving different types of algebraic equations. For example:
		<me>x^2 - 7x - 6 = 0 \hspace{1cm} e^{4x} = 2^{7x-8}</me>
	</p>
	
	<p>
		To solve the first equation, you might use factoring or the quadratic formula. However, these methods wouldn't work for the second equation, which needs a different approach. The same principle applies to differential equations. We need to classify them to determine the most effective method for solving them.
