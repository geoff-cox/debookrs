		Imagine being in a library with thousands of books. To find the book you want, you need to understand how they are arranged. Just like books in a library are organized by genre, author, or subject, we classify differential equations to understand and solve them effectively. Placing such labels on differential equations is known as <em>classification</em> and is crucial for selecting the most suitable methods for solving them.

		To demonstrate the importance of classification, recall how you would solve the following equations: 
		<me>x^2 - 4x - 7 = 0, \quad \text{and} \quad 2x - 3 = 7</me>.
		The first equation is a <em>quadratic</em> equation because it contains an <m>x^2</m> term. By recognizing this, you know to use the quadratic formula to solve it. The second equation is <em>linear</em>, so you can isolate <m>x</m> to solve it. Being able to label these equations as <em>linear</em> and <em>quadratic</em> directs you to the correct solution method. The same principle applies to differential equations.
