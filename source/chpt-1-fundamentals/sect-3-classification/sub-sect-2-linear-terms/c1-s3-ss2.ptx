	<p>
		The most informative label you can place on a differential equation is whether it is linear or not. When you first learn about linearity in mathematics, it often involves functions whose graphs are straight lines. However, when we talk about the linearity of a differential equation, the concept is different and can be tricky to grasp for a beginner.  
	</p>

	<p>
		To prepare for the definition of linearity of a DE, we need the following:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<p>
					Recall the difference between a <xref ref="dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent</xref> and <xref ref="independent-variable" text="custom">independent</xref> variable.
					<fn>
						For example, <m>y</m> is the dependent and <m>t</m> is the independent variable in the equation 
						<me>t y'' + \sin(t)y = 0</me>.
					</fn>
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<q>Terms</q> are parts in the equation that are separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					A term is <term>linear</term> if it looks like
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<me> 
			\left(\text{function of } t\right), \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y }, \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y' }, \ \
			\left(\text{function of } t\right) {\color{blue} y'' }, \ \ ...
		</me>
		where <m>{\color{blue} y }</m> is the dependent variable and <m>t</m> is the independent variable.
	Here are a few examples of linear terms:
		<me>
			3, \quad 3t, \quad 2t^2{\color{blue} y }, \quad \sin(t){\color{blue} y' }, \quad \left(t^2 - \frac{1}{t}\right){\color{blue} y''' }, \quad e^{t}{\color{blue} y^{(7)} } 
		</me>.
		Note, the (function of <m>t</m>) in each term does not need to be linear, however there can be at most one dependent variable, <m>\big( {\color{blue} y}, {\color{blue} y'}, {\color{blue} y'''}, {\color{blue} y^{(7)}} \big)</m> in each term.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Now that we are familiar with linear terms, we are ready for the next definition.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			A differential equation is said to be <term> linear </term> if it only contains linear terms. That is, it can be written as
			<men xml:id="linear-equation">
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
			</men>
			If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As you will see in the examples that follow, most equations that you encounter will only have a few terms. 
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Determine if the following differential equation is linear.
		</p>
		<me> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t </me>.

		<solution>
			<p>
				To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear. Let's rewrite this equation like <xref ref="linear-equation"/> and check each term one-by-one.
				<md>
					<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\amp 17t </mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y'' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\left(\frac{1}{t^2}\right){\color{blue} y' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y }}} =\amp 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{17t}}
					</mrow>.
				</md>
				Since every term is linear, this differential equation is linear.
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		You have seen an example of a linear differential equation, but what about a nonlinear one? Since a differential equation is nonlinear if just one of its terms is nonlinear, lets discuss what nonlinear terms look like.
	</p>

	<assemblage color="green"><title> Identifying Nonlinear Terms </title>

		<p>
			Assume <m>y</m> is the dependent variable for some differential equation.
			<fn>
				Remember, the linearity of a term only depends on the dependent variable.
			</fn>
		</p>
		<p>
			<ul marker="square">
				<li>
					<p>
						raised to a power other than 1.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						inside another function.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						multiplied or divided by one another.

				</li>
			</ul>
