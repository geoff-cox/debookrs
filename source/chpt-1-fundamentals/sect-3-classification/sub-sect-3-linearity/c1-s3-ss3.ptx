	<p>
		Now that we are familiar with linear terms, we are ready for the next definition.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			A differential equation is said to be <term> linear </term> if it only contains linear terms. That is, it can be written as
			<men xml:id="linear-equation">
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
				\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
			</men>
			If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As you will see in the examples that follow, most equations that you encounter will only have a few terms. 
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Determine if the following differential equation is linear.
		</p>
		<me> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t </me>.

		<solution>
			<p>
				To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear. Let's rewrite this equation like <xref ref="linear-equation"/> and check each term one-by-one.
				<md>
					<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\amp 17t </mrow>
					<mrow> 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y'' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\left(\frac{1}{t^2}\right){\color{blue} y' }}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{(1){\color{blue} y }}} =\amp 
						\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{17t}}
					</mrow>.
				</md>
				Since every term is linear, this differential equation is linear.
			</p>
		</solution>
