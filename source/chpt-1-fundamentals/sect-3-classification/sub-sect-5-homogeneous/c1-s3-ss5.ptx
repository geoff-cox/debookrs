<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Homogeneous </title>

	<p>
		In this section, we are going to cover what it means for a differential equation to be linear and homogeneous. Then we 
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-homogeneous">
		<statement>
			<p>
				A linear differential equation <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> is said to be <term> homogeneous </term> if <m>f(x) = 0</m> and <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> reduces to
				<men xml:id="homogeneous-eqn">
					a_n(x)\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)\ y'' + a_1(x)\ y' + a_0(x)\ y = 0.
				</men>
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Before continuing, it is important to clarify that this definition specifically refers to a differential equation that is both linear and homogeneous, not homogeneous alone. The general definition for homogeneous will not be discussed here.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Select the linear differential equations that are homogeneous.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Solution
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		If we also say that the linear homogeneous differential equation in <xref ref="def-lh-eqn"/> has <xref ref="def-linear-constant-coefficient" text="custom">constant coefficients</xref>, then <xref ref="def-lh-eqn"/> becomes
		<me>
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0,
		</me>
		which is equation <xref ref="lhcc-eqn"/> in the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/>.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Select the linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Solution
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		At this point, you should be able to identify when a differential equation is linear, homogeneous, and has constant coefficients, which is the <xref text="custom" ref="lhcc-step1"> first step </xref> in applying the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/>.
	</p>

	<outcomes>
		<ul>
			<li> 
				Identify if a differential equations has constant coefficients.
			</li>
			<li> 
				Identify if a linear differential equations is homogeneous.
			</li>
			<li> 
				Master <xref text="custom" ref="lhcc-step1"> Step 1 </xref> of <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</outcomes>

	<p>
		Since the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/> only solves linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients, we need to familiarize ourselves with these new terms. In this section, we will introduce these concepts and practice identifying which differential equations can be solved with the LHCC method.
