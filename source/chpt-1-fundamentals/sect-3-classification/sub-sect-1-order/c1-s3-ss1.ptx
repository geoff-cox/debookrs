	<p>
		Differential equations are often classified by their order, which helps us understand their complexity, the types of solutions to expect, and which solution methods to apply. In general, the higher the order, the more complex the solution will be. It's like knowing the difficulty level of a hike before starting, so you can prepare accordingly.

	<definition xml:id="def-order">
		<statement>
			<p>
				The <term>order</term> of a differential equation is the highest <term>order</term> derivative that appears in the equation.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the highest derivative in an equation is the first derivative, we say the differential equation has <em>first-order</em>. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, we say it has <em>second-order</em>, and so on.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<example xml:id="example-order-1">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x.</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 1 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a first derivative</em>) and is called a "first-order differential equation".
		</p>

		</solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-order-3">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad x^2y'' + y''' = \sin x + y^8 .</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			This DE has order 3 (<em> the highest derivative that appears in the equation is a third derivative</em>) and is called a "third-order differential equation".
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Note</em>: Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The <m>y^8</m> term just indicates that the dependent variable raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the DE.
		</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<example xml:id="example-order-2">
		<p>
			Give the order of the differential equation,
			<m>\quad \ds \frac{d^2A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17 .</m>
		</p>
		<solution>
		<p>
			Since the highest derivative is a second derivative, we say this is a second-order DE. <em> Notice that in this notation, the exponent is used to indicate the second derivative. </em>
