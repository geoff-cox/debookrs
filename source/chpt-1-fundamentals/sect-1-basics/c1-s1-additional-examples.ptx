        <p>
            Identify the dependent and independent variables of the following DEs:
            <me> y'' + xy' = \sin x, \quad \frac{dP}{dt} = P(P-10)</me>
        </p>

        <solution>
            <p>
                The first equation has dependent variable <m>y</m> and independent variable <m>x</m>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second has dependent variable <m>P</m> and independent variable <m>t</m>.
            </p>
        </solution>
