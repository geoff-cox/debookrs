<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> What is a Differential Equation? </title>

		
		<p>
			When leanring a new concept, it is typically a good strategy to build off of things that you already know. To understand what a differential equation is, it makes sense to see how it differs from stadard equations that you are familiar with. For example, suppose we wanted to solve for <m>y</m> in the following three equations
			<me>
				y + 3 = 7, \quad y + 3x = 7, \quad y^\prime + 3x = 7.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			All three are equations, but only the third equation is a <em>differential equation</em> since it contains a derivative, <m>y^\prime</m>. Nevertheless, each of these equations seek to solve for <m>y</m> by isolating it on one side of the equation. Let's look at what happens in each case.
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> 	y + 3	\amp= 7	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 4	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> 	y + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
						<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> 	y^\prime + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
						<mrow> 	y^\prime		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

			The solutions to first and second equations were found, but the third equation does not yet have a solution since we only isolated <m>y^\prime</m>, not <m>y</m>. Later, we will explore how to <q>remove</q> this derivative, leaving us with just <m>y</m>. Also, notice that the solution to the first equation is a number, while the solution to the second equation is a function of <m>x</m>. The <em>solution to a differential equation will always be a function.</em>
