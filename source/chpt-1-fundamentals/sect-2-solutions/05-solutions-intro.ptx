    The primary goal of any introductory differential equations course is to explore a variety of techniques for solving differential equations. In fact, the majority of questions you will see in this course begin with "Solve the following Differential Equation." You may be so conditioned to this statement that you will find the solution, circle the answer and move on. This leads many students to struggle with the following natural follow-up question:

  <sidebyside widths="90%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
    <p> <em>"What does it mean to be a solution to a Differential Equation?" </em> </p>
  </sidebyside>

  <p>
    This section attempts to clarify this question and provide the reader some intuition into whether the solution to a differential equation even makes sense.
