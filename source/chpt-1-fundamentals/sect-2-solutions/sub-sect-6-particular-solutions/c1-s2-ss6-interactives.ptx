        <p>
            The differential equation,
            <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, </me>
            is not an initial value problem because it does not include a value of <m>y</m> at some <m>x</m> value.
        </p>

        <p>
            In contrast, the differential equation,
            <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x, \hspace{0.25cm} y(5) = -10. </me>
            is an initial value problem because it includes the initial value <m>y(5) = -10</m>.
        </p>

	<exercise><title>What are the dependent and independent variable in this case?</title>
        <p>
            In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = <m>I</m>, and time = <m>t</m>.  For this discussion, let's assume time is in days.
        </p>

        <p>
		    Since the number of infected, <m>I</m>, changes according to how much time, <m>t</m>, has	passed, then <m>I</m> depends on <m>t</m>. Therefore, <m>I</m> would the dependent variable and <m>t</m> would be the independent variable.
        </p>

        <p>
            Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be
            <me>I(t) = \text{some function of } t</me>.
            Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time.  Now, let's say we have the solution, <m>I</m>, plug <m>t=10</m>	into it, and see the following:
            <me> I(10) = 30. </me>
            This result would be interpreted as "after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected".
        </p>
    
    
        <p>
            Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.
        </p>

	</exercise>

	<exercise><title>What is one value for the number of infected we should know?</title>

		<p>
			Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we	know
			<me>I(0) = 12</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any information about the initial value of a dependent variable is referred to as an <term> initial condition. </term>

        <statement>
        <p>
            Referring to the 2nd bullet point above, if you use initial conditions to find the constants of the general solution, then we can reasonably state that
            <sidebyside width="90%">
            <p>
                Initial conditions find a <m>\UL{\phantom{particular solution}}</m> from the general solution (or family of solutions).
            </p>
            </sidebyside>
