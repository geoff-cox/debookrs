<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Particular Solutions </title>

	<p>
		When you <q>solve</q> a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1"/> shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the <m>t, y</m>-plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose we want the solution to the differential equation 
		<me> \displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 2ty - 6t, \quad y(0) = 2 </me>.
		Etcept for the initial condition, this is the same equation we solved in the previous section, which has the general solution 
		<men xml:id="example-general-solution">y = ce^{t^2} + 3</men>. 
		The initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, tells us that "<m>y</m> must equal 2 when <m>t</m> is 0". When we substitute <m>y=2</m> and <m>t=0</m> into <xref ref="example-general-solution"/>, we see that we can solve for <m>c</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow> y =  ce^{t^2} + 3 \quad \overset{y\ =\ 2,\ t\ =\ 0}{\Rightarrow} \quad	2	\amp=  ce^{0^2} + 3	</mrow>
			<mrow>							 												2	\amp=  c + 3		</mrow>
			<mrow>																			-1	\amp=  c			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, <m>y(0) = 2</m> forces <m>c = -1</m> and we get the particular solution
		<me>y = -e^{t^2} + 3</me>.
		In <xref ref="initial-conditions-figure-1"/> can see the initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, as the point <m>(0,2)</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.

				In the graph, the point on the <m>y</m>-axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the <m>y</m>-axis.

			<p>
				As you drag the point, make the following observations:
			</p>

			<ul marker="square">
				<li> 
					Each new value of <m>y(0)</m> gives a new value of <m>c</m>, which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve). 
				</li>
				<li> 
					Only one particular solution from the family of solutions (green curves) passes through the initial condition.
