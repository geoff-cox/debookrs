				When given an algebraic equation such as <m>x^3 - 6x = 4</m>, the solution is all <em>numbers</em>, <m>x</m>, that satisfy the equation. One such solution is <m>x=-2</m>. This can be verified by plugging <m>x=-2</m> into the equation. After simplifying, if the value on the left equals the value on the right, the solution must be valid. When this happens, we say that the solution "satisfies" this equation.

		<paragraphs><title> An Analogy </title>
		<p>
			It is helpful to make an analogy here by thinking about what it means to be a solution to an algebraic equation. Consider (<em> but don't solve!</em>) the following problem and think about the questions that follow.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			What does it mean when we say <m>x = -1</m> is a solution to the equation below?
			<me> x^5 + 12x^2 +10x = 7x^3 + 24 </me>
		</p>
	
		<question>
			<title>What does solution mean in this case?</title>
	
			<p>
			In the context of this equation, a solution would be an <m>x</m>-value that "works" when we substitute it back into the equation (i.e. it satisfies the equation). If we substitute <m>x = -1</m> into each side of the equation, we have
			<md>
				<mrow>\mbox{left hand side of the equation (LHS)}	%\amp= x^5 + 12x^2 +10x,</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= (-1)^5 + 12(-1)^2 +10(-1),</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= -1 + 12 - 11,</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= 0,</mrow>
			</md>
			and
			<md>
				<mrow>\mbox{right hand side of the equation (RHS)}	%\amp= 7x^3 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= 7(-1)^3 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= -7 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= 17.</mrow>
			</md>
			</p>
	
			<p>
			When we substitute <m>x = -1</m> into the left hand side of the equation we get <m>0</m>, whereas we get <m>17</m> on the right hand side. This means <m>x = -1</m> isn't a solution to the algebraic equation. However, if we try <m>x = -3,</m> we have
			<md>
				<mrow>\mbox{LHS}	%\amp= x^5 + 12x^2 +10x,</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= (-3)^5 + 12(-3)^2 +10(-3),</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= -243 + 108 - 30,</mrow>
				<mrow>							\amp= -165,</mrow>
			</md>
			and
			<md>
				<mrow>\mbox{RHS}	%\amp= 7x^3 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= 7(-3)^3 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= -189 + 24,</mrow>
				<mrow>								\amp= -165.</mrow>
			</md>
			</p>
	
			<p>
			Since we get the same result when we substitute <m>x = -3</m> in on the left hand and right hand sides of the equation, we can conclude that <m>x = -3</m> is a solution to the algebraic equation.
			</p>
	
		</question>
	
		<p>
			Let's take a moment to highlight some important details about how the previous example gives insight into the concept of a solution to a differential equation.
		</p>
	
		<ul>
			<li>
			Your intuition for algebra should tell you that there is probably more solutions than <m>x = -3</m> to this equation (and you'd be correct). It turns out that differential equations also can have multiple solutions!
			</li>
			<li>
			At no point did we discuss the technique needed to find the solution <m>x = -3</m>. However, this did not stop us from verifying that it was a solution. This fact also transfers to differential equations! Indeed, as you will see in the exercises, given a function, you will be able to verify whether this function is (or is not) a solution to a differential equation.

		<example xml:id="calculus-pov"><title> A Calculus Perspective </title>
			
			<p>
				Suppose you were given <m> y(t) = 4t^3 + \sin t </m>, and asked to find <m>y''</m>.
			</p>
		
			<p/>
		
			<p>
				Since we are familiar with calculus, we quickly take two derivatives of <m>y</m>, giving
				<md>
					<mrow> y' 	\amp= 12t^2	+ \cos t		</mrow>
					<mrow> y'' 	\amp= 24t 	- \sin t.		</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This task is no problem for us, but suppose we started with
				<me> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t	</me>
				and were asked to go in the reverse direction. That is, find a function, <m>y(t)</m>, that has <m>24t - \sin t</m> as a second derivative. <em> This is precisely what solving a differential equation aims to do and we would phrase this problem as, </em>
			</p>

			<sidebyside widths="80%" halign="center" valign="bottom">
				<p>
					"given the differential equation, <m> y'' = 24t 	- \sin t</m>, solve for <m>y.</m>"
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			
		</example>
		
		<example xml:id="physics-pov"><title> A Physics Perspective </title>
			<p>
				Let <m>y(t)</m> be the position of some object at time, <m>t</m>.  Assume for the moment that we don't know what <m>y</m> is, but we do know the object is moving with a constant velocity of <m>4.6</m> meters per second.
			</p>  
				
			<p>
				Physics tells us that velocity is the rate of change of position (i.e., derivative of position, <m>y'(t)</m>). So, given that the object is moving at a known constant velocity, we may write
				<me> y'(t) = 4.6. </me>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This is another example of a differential equation where one could ask "what function, <m>y(t)</m>, has a derivative that is equal to <m>4.6</m>?"
