        Solutions to differential equations can be represented in multiple forms. Whether explicit or implicit, general or particular, each solution type provides valuable insights into the behavior of the modeled system. Initial conditions play a vital role in determining specific solutions, transforming general solutions into meaningful, context-specific answers.
