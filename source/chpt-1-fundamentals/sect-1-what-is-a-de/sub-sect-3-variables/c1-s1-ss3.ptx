<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>

	<p>
		In this section, we will discuss the two types of variables that appear in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. We will also explore how to identify these variables and understand their roles in the context of solving differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		As you can see, the differential equation,
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 3x^2,
		</men>
		has two variables: <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. One of these variables is the <q>unknown</q> that we are trying to solve for.  But, which one?
	</p>
		
	<p>
		In general, the variable that you want to solve for will always have a derivative applied to it. The presence of the <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> in <xref ref="variables-de-1"/> implies 
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					the derivative (with respect to <m>x</m>) is being applied to <m>y</m>, and
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					<m>y</m> must be a function of <m>x</m>.
					<fn>Otherwise, it wouldn't make sense to take the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>.</fn>
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		Since <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>, we call <m>y</m> the <em>dependent variable</em>. Consequently, <m>x</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.
	</p>

					<title>Dependent Variable</title>

						The variable representing the unknown function we want to find. It will always have a derivative applied to it.

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>\frac{dP}{ds}</m> appears in this equation, it is implied that
				<ul>
					<li>
						<m>P</m> is a function that depends on <m>s</m> and must be the <em>dependent variable</em>,
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>s</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>P(s)</m> represents the <em>solution</em> to this differential equation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</solution>
	
	</example>
	
	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
	
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> u'' + t^2 \ u = 0 </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>u''</m> appears in this equation, it is implied that
				<ul>
					<li>
						<m>u</m> is a function that depends on <m>t</m> and must be the <em>dependent variable</em>,
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>, and
					</li>
					<li>
						<m>u(t)</m> represents the <em>solution</em> to this differential equation.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<example><title> <em>Identify the Variables</em> </title>
	
		<p>
			Identify the dependent and independent variables in the differential equation
			<me> Q'' = 11Q </me>,
			and state which variable represents the solution.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Since <m>Q''</m> appears in this equation, we know that <m>Q</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>, but there is no sign of an independent variable. Typically the context of the problem will tell us the independent variable. Otherwise, we are free to select our own independent variable, say <m>t</m>. Now we can say that <m>Q(t)</m> would be the <em>solution</em>.
