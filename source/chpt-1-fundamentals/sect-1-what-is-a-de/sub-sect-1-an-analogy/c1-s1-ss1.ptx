		When learning a new concept, it is typically a good strategy to build off of things that you already know. To understand what a differential equation is, it makes sense to see how it differs from stadard equations that you are familiar with. For example, suppose we wanted to solve for <m>y</m> in the following three equations
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<me>y + 3 = 7</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>y + 3x = 7</me>
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>y^\prime + 3x = 7</me>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		All three are equations, but only the third equation is a <em>differential equation</em> since it contains the derivative, <m>y^\prime</m>. Let's try to solve for <m>y</m> in each of these cases.
		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y + 3	\amp= 7	</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 4	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y 		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> 	y^\prime + 3x	\amp= 7			</mrow>
					<mrow> 	y^\prime		\amp= 7 - 3x	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>
		We isolated <m>y</m> in the first two equations and <m>y^\prime</m> in the third. Later, we will explore how to <q>remove</q> this derivative, leaving us with just <m>y</m>.
