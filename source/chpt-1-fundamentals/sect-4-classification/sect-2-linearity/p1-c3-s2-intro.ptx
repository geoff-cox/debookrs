		WRITE SOME INTRODUCTORY TEXT...  
	</p>

	<p>
		Every differential equation is also either <term>linear</term> or <term>nonlinear</term>.
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-linear">
		<statement>
			A differential equation is said to be <term> linear </term> if it can be written as
			<men xml:id="def-linear-eqn">
				a_n(x)y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x).
			</men>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		This definition is intended to represent the form of all possible linear differential equations, so it may seem a bit overwhelming. It may be easier to understand linearity based on what it is not, rather than what it is. So, let's begin by describing characteristics of a DE that make it nonlinear.

		<p>
			A differential equation is <term>nonlinear</term> if any of the following are true about the dependent variable and/or its derivatives:
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="6% 94%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
			<p><m>\succ</m></p>	<p>Has a power other than 1.</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<sidebyside widths="14% 86%" margins="auto" valign="top">
			<p>
				<em> Example: </em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<m>\DS y'' + y^2 = x^3</m> is nonlinear because the dependent
				variable,	<m>y</m>, is raised to the second power.
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<sidebyside widths="6% 94%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
			<p><m>\succ</m></p> <p>Is inside another function.</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<sidebyside widths="14% 86%" margins="auto" valign="top">
			<p><em> Example: </em></p>
			<p>
				<m>y'' + \ln(y') = e^x</m> is nonlinear since the derivative,
				<m>y'</m>, is inside a logarithmic function.
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<sidebyside widths="6% 94%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
			<p><m>\succ</m></p>	<p>Are multiplied together.</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<sidebyside widths="14% 86%" margins="auto" valign="top">
			<p><em> Example: </em></p>
			<p>
				<m>y'\cdot y'' + e^x y = y'</m> is nonlinear since the first term
				is a	product of <m>y'</m> and <m>y''</m>.
			</p>

		Edit Notes:
		<ul>
			<li>PERHAPS END WITH A PARAGRAPH STATING THAT THERE ARE MORE WAYS TO CLASSIFY DES AND THAT WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED A FEW? </li>
			<li>Greg Comment: Are there really only 2 types of DEs we want to discuss here? How about non/homogeneous? Did we decide on this?</li>
			<li>Greg Comment: I like the idea of showing what a linear equation <em>is not</em>. Can we do more to say what it is? I have in mind something like ``It's a function of x times a derivative of y, plus a function of x times a derivative of y, etc.</li>
		</ul>

		Let's now look at an example of a linear differential equation.
	</p>

	<example xml:id="example-linearity-01">

		<p>
			Determine if the following differential equation is linear.
			<me> y'' + \frac{y'}{x^2} + y = 17x </me>.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
			This equation is almost in the form (with <m>n=2</m>)
			<xref ref="def-linear"/>.  We just need to make a minor adjustment to
			see all the parts explicity,
			<me>(1)y'' + \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)y' + (1)y = 17x</me>
			where (matching with <xref ref="def-linear"/>)
			<me>\DS a_2 = 1, \,\,
				a_1 = \frac{1}{x^2}, \,\,
				a_0 = 1, \,\,\text{ and } \,\,
				f(x) = 17x</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
