	<p>
		This chapter is all about linear differential equations with constant coefficients. To get started, let's review what it means to be a coefficient in a differential equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Back in the first chapter, we considered the 5-term equation
		<me>
			\us{y^{(6)}	\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ \frac{3}{x}	{\color{blue}\ y^{(6)}	}	}	} +
			\us{y''		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		5.3	{\color{blue}\ y''		} 	}	} +
			\us{y' 		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		x^2	{\color{blue}\ y'		} 	}	} -
			\us{y 		\text{ term}	}{\us{\uparrow}{	{\color{blue}\ y		} 	}	} =
			\us{\text{constant term}	}{\ub{\ \frac12\ln(x)\ 							}	}
		</me>,
		with the coefficients <m>\frac{3}{x},\ 5.3,\ x^2,\ 1</m> and <m>\frac12\ln(x)</m>. We observed that some of the coefficients were <em>functions</em> <m>\big(\frac{3}{x}</m> &amp; <m>x^2\big)</m> and some were <em>constants</em> (<m>5.3</m> &amp; <m>1</m>). Naturally, a differential equation that is said to have <em>constant coefficients</em> should only have coefficients that are constant, as the next definition states.

	<definition><title> Constant Coefficients </title>
	
		<statement>
			<p>
				A differential equation is said to have <term> constant coefficients </term> if every coefficient in the equation is constant.
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<example>

		<p>
			All of the differential equations, below, have constant coefficients.
		</p>
		<me>
			\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}y' = y, \quad s'''+\pi s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>

		<p>
			Whereas, the following differential equations do not:
		</p>
		<me>
			t\frac{dP}{dt} + P^2 = \sqrt{t}, \quad \frac15 y^{(8)} - \sqrt{15}x y' = y, \quad s'''+ \cos(\pi w) s = \frac{7}{w}
		</me>
