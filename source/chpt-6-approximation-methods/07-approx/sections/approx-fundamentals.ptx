			Several techniques have been discussed for resolving differential equations, although they are not always simple to solve. For instance, consider the equation
			<men xml:id="riccati-eqn">
				y' = y^2 - x.
			</men>
			Though this equation may seem straightforward, the non-linear term, <m>y^2</m>, makes solving it substantially more challenging. In fact, the solution <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is so complex, special functions were introduced to make it easier to represent.
			<fn>
				The solution to <xref ref="riccati-eqn"/> is described by
				<me>
					y = \frac{ 3 x \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{4}{3}} \left( x \right) - c_1 J_{\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) + 2 J_{-\frac{2}{3}}\left( x \right) \right) + 2 c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}}\left( x \right) }{ (12 x)^{2/3} \left(c_1 J_{-\frac{1}{3}} \left( x \right) + J_{\frac{1}{3}} \left(x \right) \right)}
				</me>
				where <m>J_n(x)</m> denotes a Bessel function defined as
				<me>
					J_n( x ) = \sum_{m=0}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^m}{m! \ \Gamma(m + n + 1)}\left( \frac{i}{3} x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right)^{2m + n}.
				</me>
			</fn>

			The reality is that the exact solutions to many differential equations simply cannot be written in the form of a standard function. As an alternative, we can calculate a "substitute" for the actual solution. This replacement is called a numerical solution and is assumed to closely resemble the true solution.
			<aside>
				<p>
					The statement, ''closely resembles the true solution'', refers to the idea that if you were to plot both functions, their graphs would nearly coincide.

			This chapter delves into the concepts of approximation and explores some of the basic algorithms used to generate the numerical solutions to various differential equations.
