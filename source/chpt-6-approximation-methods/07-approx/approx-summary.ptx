	<p>
		In summary, Euler's method is a powerful tool for approximating the solutions of differential equations that are challenging or impossible to solve analytically. By understanding and applying this method, students and professionals can gain insights into the behavior of complex systems described by such equations, even in the absence of exact solutions.
