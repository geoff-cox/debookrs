	<title> Questions </title>

		<p>
			<ul marker="square">
				<li>
					Explain the meaning of each of the variables <m>I, t, k,</m> and <m>N</m>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Write an initial condition based on the experimental data collected in class.
				</li>

				<li>
					Explain why the differential equation makes sense. What is the meaning of <m>\ds\frac{dI}{dt}</m> (in terms of the real-world scenario) and why does the right-hand side of the DE make sense?
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
						There are two values of <m>I</m> that would make <m>\ds\frac{dI}{dt}</m> equal to zero. In calculus, we would have called these critical values.

					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							Name the two critical values.
						</li>

						<li>
							For each of the values you named in question 4a, explain their significance in terms of the spread of the illness, and explain why it makes sense that <m>\ds\frac{dI}{dt}=0</m> for those values.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</li>

				<li>
					Find the general solution for the differential equation. Use the number of people in our class as <m>N</m>, and use the initial condition you wrote in question 2. You'll likely end up needing to do a partial fraction decomposition. This is a perfect time to review this skill because we'll need it soon. Note that you will not yet have a value for <m>k</m>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Using the time at which half (or approximately half) of the class was infected, determine a value for <m>k</m>.
				</li>

				<li>
					Now that you have <m>k</m>, write down the solution to the DE.																			
				</li>

				<li>
					<p>
					Now that you have a solution, compare the solution to the data that was collected.

					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							Plot both the data and the solution curve on the same axes. Make sure your axes are labeled, your plot has an appropriate title and a legend. Make sure your font is big enough and that the plot is readable. Recall that data is usually plotted with markers only, while we use lines to connect points on the model solution curve.
						</li>

						<li>
							Imagine that you are a scientist trying to understand the spread of a disease. You find data on several small, localized outbreaks like the one in our class. Which is better in helping to understand the nature of the disease: the model or the data? Be sure to explain and justify your thoughts on this question.

				Recall the first modeling scenario we did with M&amp;Ms. In the last section of the scenario, we switched from a discrete model to a continuous model, which led to the following DE. <m> \ds b'(t) = -0.5b(t) + 10 </m> Suppose there were initially 50 M&amp;Ms.  Then we also have the initial condition <m> \ds b(0) = 50 </m>
				</title>
					<exercise>
						<statement>
							Solve the initial value problem using an integrating factor.
							<p/>
						</statement>
						<solution>
							<p>
						We begin by finding the general solution. First we put DE in standard form for a first-order linear DE <m> \ds \frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = f(x), </m> so we can identify <m> \ds P(x). </m>  Notice that for this DE <m> \ds t </m> is the independent variable (i.e., it is like the <m> \ds x </m> ) and <m> \ds b </m> is the dependent variable (i.e., it is like the <m> \ds y </m> ).  Hence the standard form we will aim for is <m> \ds \frac{db}{dt} + P(t)b = f(t), </m> and we want to identify <m> \ds P(t). </m>
							<md>
								<mrow>  b'(t)	 \amp =  -0.5b(t) + 10 </mrow>
								<mrow>  b'(t) + 0.5b(t)	 \amp =  10 </mrow>
								<mrow>  b' + 0.5b	 \amp =  10 </mrow>
		
							</md>
							Thus,  <m> \ds P(t) =  0.5. </m>  Then we find the integrating factor <m> \ds z. </m>
							<md>
								<mrow>  z	 \amp =  e^{\Big(\mbox{an antiderivative of <m> \ds P(t) </m> }\Big)} </mrow>
								<mrow>   \amp =  e^{\Big(\mbox{an antiderivative of <m> \ds 0.5 </m> }\Big)} </mrow>
								<mrow>   \amp =  e^{0.5t} </mrow>
		
							</md>
							Now we multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.
							<md>
								<mrow>  e^{0.5t}\cdot b' + e^{0.5t}\cdot 0.5b	 \amp =  e^{0.5t}\cdot 10 \nonumber </mrow>
								<mrow>  e^{0.5t}\cdot b' + 0.5e^{0.5t}\cdot b	 \amp =  10e^{0.5t} \nonumber </mrow>
								<mrow>  \underbrace{e^{0.5t}}_{f}\cdot \underbrace{b'}_{g'} + \underbrace{0.5e^{0.5t}}_{f'}\cdot \underbrace{b}_{g}	 \amp =  10e^{0.5t} \label{eq60}  </mrow>
							</md>
							Now we recall the product rule for derivatives: <m> \ds \frac{d}{dt}\Big( f\cdot g \Big) = f\cdot g' + f' \cdot g. </m> We note that the two terms on the left hand side of equation (\ref{eq60}) are the result of taking the derivative of the product.  Hence we can undo the product rule as follows: <m> \ds\frac{d}{dt}\Big(e^{0.5t}\cdot b \Big) = 10e^{0.5t}.</m> Now we can integrate both sides of the equation and then solve for the dependent variable.
							<md>
								<mrow>  \int \frac{d}{dt}\Big(e^{0.5t}\cdot b \Big)dt	 \amp =  \int(10e^{0.5t}) dt </mrow>
								<mrow>  e^{0.5t}\cdot b	 \amp =  \frac{10}{0.5}e^{0.5t} + C </mrow>
								<mrow>  e^{0.5t}\cdot b	 \amp =  20e^{0.5t} + C </mrow>
								<mrow>  b	 \amp =  20 + Ce^{-0.5t} </mrow>
		
							</md>
							We now take the general solution and apply the initial condition <m> \ds b(0) = 50 </m> so that we can solve for the particular solution.
							<md>
								<mrow>  50	 \amp =  b(0) </mrow>
								<mrow>   \amp =  20 + Ce^{-0.5\cdot 0} </mrow>
								<mrow>   \amp =  20 + C </mrow>
								<mrow>  30	 \amp =  C </mrow>
		
							</md>
							Hence, the solution to this IVP is <m> \ds b = 20 + 30e^{-0.5t}. </m>

			At least one student was infected with the incurable illness Math Excitis. Each round will consist of the following.

			<ul marker="square">
				<li>
					Students report to the station number they have been assigned for this round (station numbers are randomly generated).
				</li>
			
				<li>
					If there is at least one infected person at the station, all non-infected students flip a coin.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					If the coin lands heads up, the student becomes infected.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					If the coin lands tails up, the student remains healthy.
				</li>
			
				<li>
					The total number of infected students is recorded.

			Write a report that includes the mathematical solutions and ideas above, presented seamlessly. This should not as numbered or lettered problems, nor as a bulleted list, but as a report with an introduction to the concept, the meaning of the equations, how they are solved, and how the differential equation can be adapted in the three different scenarios - dice roll, fewer stations, more students infected initially.
		</p>

		<p>
			At a minimum, you should do the following.
			<ul marker="square">
				<li>

				</li>

				<li>
					Describe the differential equation(s), and why they represent the scenario(s).
				</li>

				<li>
					Explain the meaning of the critical numbers.
				</li>

				</li>

				<li>
					Include the math you used to get your general and particular solutions. You may hand-write this part and include it as an appendix, referring to it in the text of your paper.
