		In the previous chapter, we studied a solution technique for DEs that are linear and have constant coefficients. We were able to solve certain nonhomogeneous DEs of this type, so long as the nonhomogeneous function belongs to a certain subset of functions. We would not be able to use that technique to solve DEs where the nonhomogeneous function is discontinuous. This is the main reason we study a new solution technique, called the <em>Laplace Transform</em>.
