<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Properties </title>

	<p>
		Let's build on what we did in the previous section.
	</p>

	<example><title>Find a Laplace transform of the sum of functions</title>

		<p>
			Find the Laplace transform of the function
			<me> f(t) = 15 + 6e^{7t} - 11t. </me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Hopefully those functions look familiar from the previous section. In fact, we can write that
				<me> f(t) = g(t) + 6x(t) - q(t). </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Given that <m>f</m> can be written in terms of the functions <m>g</m>, <m>x</m> and <m>q</m> that we examined in the previous section, we might like to take advantage of the results we found. We will, but let's use the definition of the Laplace transform to see exactly how we might incorporate those previous results.
				<md>
					<mrow> F(s)	\amp= \lap\{ f(t) \} 																</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st}f(t)dt 												</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st}\left(15 + 6e^{7t} - 11t\right)dt 						</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \int_0^{\infty} \left( 15e^{-st} + 6e^{-st}e^{7t} - e^{-st}\cdot 11t \right)	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we can use properties of integration to rewrite this expression. Recall that we can	<em> split the integral up over addition and/or subtraction and we can pull out coefficients </em> if we like.
				<md>
					<mrow> F(s)	\amp= \int_0^{\infty} \left(15e^{-st} + 6e^{-st}e^{7t} - e^{-st}\cdot 11t \right)dt						</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \int_0^{\infty}15e^{-st}dt + 6\int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}e^{7t}dt - \int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}\cdot 11tdt	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				The first integral was the integral we evaluated in Example 1 of the previous section; similar with the other two integrals. We can actually write this as:

				<md>
					<mrow> F(s)	\amp=  \int_0^{\infty}15e^{-st}dt + 6\int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}e^{7t}dt - \int_0^{\infty}e^{-st}\cdot 11tdt,	</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \lap\{g(t)\} + 6\lap\{ x(t) \} - \lap\{ q(t) \},														</mrow>
					<mrow>		\amp= \ub{\frac{15}{s}}_{s \gt 0} + 6\ub{\frac{1}{s - 7}}_{s \gt 7} - \ub{\frac{11}{s^2}}_{s \gt 0}.		</mrow>
				</md>

			</p>

			<p>
				We need to deal with those conditions on <m>s</m>. If we need to make sure that <m>s >0</m> <em>and</em> that <m>s \gt 7</m>, it's sufficient to say that <m>s \gt 7</m> (because this guarantees that <m>s \gt 0</m> also). So we actually have 
				<me> F(s) = \frac{15}{s} + 6\cdot \frac{1}{s-7} - \frac{11}{s^2}, \quad s \gt 7. </me>
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>

	<p>
		We found the desired answer, but now is a good time to step back and see that we just showed something very interesting and useful. We can actually rewrite that last result as the equation below.
		<me> \lap\{ g(t) + 6x(t) - q(t)\} = \lap\{g(t)\} + 6\lap\{ x(t) \} - \lap\{ q(t) \} </me>
	</p>

	<p>
		It turns out (unsurprisingly) that the Laplace transform has the same properties that integrals do:  we can separate over addition and subtraction, and we can pull out coefficients. This is summarized in a single property that is often referred to is the <term>linearity</term> of the Laplace transform. 

		<sidebyside widths="90%" margins="auto" valign="middle">
			<p>
				<term>Property</term>:  The Laplace transform is a linear transform. This means that if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, and <m>f(t)</m> and <m>g(t)</m> are functions that have Laplace transforms <m>F(s)</m> and <m>G(s)</m>, respectively, then
				<me> \lap\{ a f(t) \pm b g(t) \} = a \lap\{ f(t) \} \pm b \lap\{ g(t) \}, </me>
				or, equivalently, 
				<me> \lap\{ a f(t) \pm b g(t) \} = a F(s) \pm b G(s). </me>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

				<m> \ds \lap\{f'(t)\} = s\lap{f(t)} - f(0) \quad s \gt 0 \qquad </m>
