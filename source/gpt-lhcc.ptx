<section><title> Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficients </title>
	
	<introduction>

		<p>
			As you might guess, the higher the derivative in a differential equation, the trickier it gets. But don't worry! There's a class of higher-order equations that are surprisingly manageable and serve as a great introduction to more complex topics. These are called linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, or LHCC for short.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			In this section, we'll learn to identify these equations using the concepts of homogeneity and constant coefficients. Then, we'll explore a technique that links these equations to something called the <em>characteristic equation</em>.
		</p>
	
	</introduction>

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> LHCC Equations </title>
	
		<p>
			As mentioned earlier, LHCC equations are linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. To keep things simple, we call them LHCC equations. But how do we recognize them? Let's break down the tags: <em>linear</em>, <em>homogeneous</em>, and <em>constant coefficients</em>.
		</p>
	
		<p> 
			A linear differential equation looks like this:
			<men xml:id="linear-equation-w-coefficents">
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_n(x)}}} y^{(n)} + \cdots +
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_2(x)}}} y''	 	+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_1(x)}}} y' 		+
				{\color{blue} \os{\text{coefficient}}{\os{\downarrow}{a_0(x)}}} y 		=
				\os{\text{constant term}}{\os{\downarrow}{f(x).}}
			</men>
			If the constant term is zero, then the equation is <term>homogeneous</term>. If all the coefficients are constants (i.e., numbers), then it has <term>constant coefficients</term>. Let's combine these ideas in a formal definition.
		</p>
	
		<definition xml:id="def-lhcc">
			<statement>
				<p>
					A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) has the form 
				</p>
				<men xml:id="lhcc-equation">
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0
				</men>
				<p>
					where <m>a_n,\ a_{n-1},\ \ldots,\ a_2,\ a_1,\ a_0</m> are constants.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</definition>
	
		<p>
			Let's practice identifying these equations with a few examples.
		</p>
	
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Which of the linear differential equations below are homogeneous?
				</p>
				<me> 
					3y'' - 2ty' + y = 0, \quad 
					\frac{dg}{dx} + 3x^2 = 0, \quad 
					\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} = 4s 
				</me>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					The trick is to check if the constant term is zero. Rewrite each equation with the constant term on the right:
				</p>
				<p> 
					<me> 
						3y'' - 2ty' + y	= {\color{blue} 0}, \quad 
						\frac{dg}{dx}	= {\color{blue} -3x^2}, \quad 
						\frac{d^2s}{dt^2} + \frac{ds}{dt} - 4s = {\color{blue} 0} 
					</me>.
					The first and last equations are homogeneous.
				</p>
			</solution>
	
		</example>
	
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Which of the linear differential equations have constant coefficients?
				</p>
				<me> 
					3y'' - 2\tau y' + y = \tau, \quad 
					\sqrt{t} - \frac{dP}{dt} - \frac{P^2}{2} = 1, \quad 
					s''' = \frac{7s}{w}
				</me>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Check if each coefficient is constant:
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> 
						\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{3}}} y'' - 
						\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{2\tau}}}\ y' +

						\sqrt{t} - 
						\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} \frac{dP}{dt} - 
						\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{1}{2}}}} P^2 = 1, \quad
						\os{\text{yes}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{1}}} s''' = 
						\os{\text{no}}{\os{\downarrow}{\ul{\frac{7}{w}}}} s
					</me>.
					Only the second equation has constant coefficients.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> LHCC Solutions </title>

		<p>
			Our goal is to solve <xref ref="def-lhcc" text="custom">LHCC equations</xref>. Before diving into solutions, let's develop some intuition.
		</p>

		<p>
			Recall from calculus the function whose derivative is itself. If you thought of <m>e^x</m>, you're right! This can be framed as a differential equation: find the function <m>y</m> such that <m>y' = y</m>. The solution is <m>y = e^x</m>, but it's also true that <m>y = c e^x</m> for any constant <m>c</m>. Now, consider a function whose derivative is a multiple of itself, like <m>3y</m>. You might think of <m>y = e^{3x}</m>. If this isn't obvious, you can solve <m>y' = 3y</m> using separation of variables to find <m>y = c e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This leads us to an important concept:
			<assemblage><title> Property of the Exponential Function </title>
				<p>
					<ul marker="square">
						<li>
							<m>e^{rx}</m> is the only function whose derivative is a multiple of itself.
						</li>
						<li>
							<m>e^{rx}</m> and its derivatives are like terms that can be combined.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</assemblage>
			Most functions change fundamentally when differentiated and do not yield like terms that can be combined. For example, the derivative of <m>x^8</m> is <m>8x^7</m>, which cannot be combined or simplified in the same way. However, <m>e^{3x}</m> and its derivative <m>3e^{3x}</m> can be added together as <m>e^{3x} + 3e^{3x} = 4e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Going back to the LHCC equation,
			<men xml:id="lhcc-equation-like-terms">
				\us{\text{must sum to } 0 \text{ after substituting } y}{\ub{
					a_n\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y
				}}	= 0
			</men>,
			the right-hand side is zero, so the left-hand side must sum to zero after substituting <m>y</m>. This can only happen if the solution <m>y</m> and its derivatives combine to cancel each other out. However, the only possible functions that can be substituted for <m>y</m> are ones that contain <m>e^{rx}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's look at a concrete example to illustrate why <m>e^{rx}</m> simplifies nicely in these equations, while other functions may not.
		</p>

		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Consider the LHCC equation:
				</p>
				<me>
					y'' + 3y' - 4y = 0.
				</me>
				<p>
					Verify that <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution, but <m>y = x^4</m> and <m>y = \sin(4x)</m> are not.
				</p>
			</statement>
			<solution>
				<p>
					Let's check each function:
				</p>
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[e^{4x}]'' + 3\left[e^{4x}\right]' - 4\left[e^{4x}\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{like terms simplify to }0}{\ub{
									16e^{4x} + 12e^{4x} - 4e^{4x}

							</mrow>
							<mrow> 	0	\amp= 0	\ \ ✅ </mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> 	[x^4]'' + 3\left[x^4\right]' - 4\left[x^4\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	
								\us{\text{not like terms}}{\ub{
									24x^2 + 12x^3 - 4x^4	
								}}
								\amp= 0	\ \ ❌
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> 	[\sin(4x)]'' + 3\left[\sin(4x)\right]' - 4\left[\sin(4x)\right]	\amp= 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	
							\us{\text{not like terms}}{\ub{
								-16\sin(4x) + 12\cos(4x) - 4\sin(4x)	
							}}
							\amp= 0	\ \ ❌
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					Of these three, only <m>y = e^{4x}</m> is a solution.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			This example shows that <m>e^{rx}</m> is best suited for LHCC equations, but it doesn't tell the whole story. In some cases, if <m>e^{rx}</m> is a solution, then it is possible that <m>xe^{rx}</m> could also be a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			The takeaway from this section should be that solutions to LHCC equations must involve <m>e^{rx}</m>, but not every value of <m>r</m> works. In the next section, we will see that the key to finding the general solution lies in finding the values of <m>r</m> that correspond to solutions.
		</p>

	</subsection>

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Characteristic Equation </title>

		<p>
			The previous section showed us that solutions to LHCC equations involve <m>e^{rx}</m> terms. We will now build on this idea by showing that every LHCC equation is associated with another equation that allows us to find the specific <m>r</m>-values that give us our solutions. Let's explore this by looking at a few concrete examples, starting the equation
			<me>y' - 5y = 0</me>,
			Now, imagine we wanted verify that <m>y = e^{rx}</m> is a solution to this equation. To do this, we plug it into the equation and see if it leads to <m>0=0</m>. In this case, we get
			<md>
				<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right] \amp= 0 </mrow>
				<mrow>	r e^{rx} - 5 e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
				<mrow>	\us{\text{must be 0}}{\ub{(r - 5) e^{rx}}} \amp= 0 </mrow>
			</md>,
			which shows that the left-side must also be <m>0</m>, but this only happens for specific <m>r</m>-values. To find them, we solve 
			<md>
				<mrow>	(r - 5) e^{rx}	=\amp \ 0 \qquad (e^{rx} \text{ is never 0})</mrow>
				<mrow>			r - 5	=\amp \ 0 \quad \rightarrow \quad r = 5</mrow>
			</md>,
			showing that <m>e^{5x}</m> is a solution. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, let's add a second derivative to the equation, say 
			<me>y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0</me>,
			and plug <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into this equation:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>	\left[e^{rx}\right]'' - 5 \left[e^{rx}\right]' + 6 \left[e^{rx}\right] \amp= 0 </mrow>
			<mrow>	r^2 e^{rx} - 5 r e^{rx} + 6 e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
			<mrow>	(r^2 - 5r + 6) e^{rx} \amp= 0 </mrow>
		</md>
		<p>
			Again, <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, so we must have <m>r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0</m>. Solving this quadratic equation gives <m>r = 2</m> and <m>r = 3</m>, yielding the solutions <m>e^{2x}</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Let's generalize this idea by plugging <m>y = e^{rx}</m> into the general <xref ref="lhcc-equation" text="custom">LHCC equation</xref>:
		</p>
		<md>
			<mrow>	
				a_n\ \left[e^{rx}\right]^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2\ \left[e^{rx}\right]'' + a_1\ \left[e^{rx}\right]' + a_0\ e^{rx} \amp= 0

			<mrow>	\left(a_n\ r^n + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 + a_1\ r + a_0\right)e^{rx}  \amp= 0 </mrow>
		</md>.
		<p>
			Following the same pattern as before, we get the <m>r</m>-values we need by solving
		</p>
		<me>
			a_n\ r^n + \cdots + a_2\ r^2 + a_1\ r + a_0 = 0
		</me>.
		<p>
			This polynomial equation that gives us the <m>r</m>-values we need to write down our solutions is referred to as the <em>characteristic equation</em>.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> First-Order LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
		  <p>
			Now that we've learned about characteristic equations, let's dive into solving first-order linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients. These equations are simpler and serve as a great starting point before tackling higher-order equations.
		  </p>
		</introduction>
		
		<p>
		  A first-order LHCC equation takes the form:
		  <me> a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0 </me>.
		  Here, <m>a_1</m> and <m>a_0</m> are constants. To solve this equation, we'll use the characteristic equation technique we introduced earlier.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  First, we assume a solution of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>. Substituting this into our differential equation gives us:
		  <md>
			<mrow> a_1 \left[ e^{rx} \right]' + a_0 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
			<mrow> a_1 r e^{rx} + a_0 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
			<mrow> e^{rx} (a_1 r + a_0) = 0 </mrow>
		  </md>.
		  Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we get the characteristic equation:
		  <me> a_1 r + a_0 = 0 </me>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  Solving this for <m>r</m> gives:
		  <md>
			<mrow> r = -\frac{a_0}{a_1} </mrow>
		  </md>.
		  Thus, the general solution to our first-order LHCC equation is:
		  <me> y = C e^{-\frac{a_0}{a_1} x} </me>,
		  where <m>C</m> is an arbitrary constant.
		</p>
		
		<example>
		  <statement>
			<p>
			  Let's solve the first-order LHCC equation:
			</p>
			<me> 3y' - 9y = 0 </me>.
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
			<p>
			  First, write down the characteristic equation:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> 3r - 9 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Solving for <m>r</m> gives:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r = \frac{9}{3} = 3 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Therefore, the general solution is:
			</p>
			<me> y = C e^{3x} </me>.
		  </solution>
		</example>
		
		<example>
		  <statement>
			<p>
			  Consider another example:
			</p>
			<me> 5y' + 2y = 0 </me>.
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
			<p>
			  The characteristic equation is:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> 5r + 2 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Solving for <m>r</m> gives:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r = -\frac{2}{5} </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Thus, the general solution is:
			</p>
			<me> y = C e^{-\frac{2}{5}x} </me>.
		  </solution>
		</example>
		
		<p>
		  By following these steps, we can solve any first-order LHCC equation using the characteristic equation. This method is not only straightforward but also powerful, setting a solid foundation for solving higher-order equations.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Second-Order LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				After mastering first-order LHCC equations, we are now ready to tackle second-order LHCC equations. These equations are slightly more complex but follow a similar approach. We'll see how the characteristic equation helps us find solutions and explore the different cases that arise based on its roots.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		
		<p>
			A second-order LHCC equation has the form:
			<me> a_2 y'' + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0 </me>.
			Here, <m>a_2</m>, <m>a_1</m>, and <m>a_0</m> are constants. To solve this equation, we'll use the characteristic equation approach.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			First, we assume a solution of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m>. Substituting this into our differential equation gives us:
			<md>
				<mrow> a_2 \left[ e^{rx} \right]'' + a_1 \left[ e^{rx} \right]' + a_0 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
				<mrow> a_2 r^2 e^{rx} + a_1 r e^{rx} + a_0 e^{rx} = 0 </mrow>
				<mrow> e^{rx} (a_2 r^2 + a_1 r + a_0) = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			Since <m>e^{rx}</m> is never zero, we get the characteristic equation:
			<me> a_2 r^2 + a_1 r + a_0 = 0 </me>.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The solutions to this quadratic characteristic equation, <m>a_2 r^2 + a_1 r + a_0 = 0</m>, determine the form of the general solution to our second-order LHCC equation. There are three distinct cases based on the discriminant <m>\Delta = a_1^2 - 4a_2a_0</m>:
		</p>
		
		<assemblage><title> Summary of Cases </title>
			<p>
				Depending on the value of the discriminant <m>\Delta</m>, the roots of the characteristic equation and the corresponding general solutions can be summarized as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Case 1: Distinct Real Roots (<m>\Delta > 0</m>)</b>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta > 0</m>, the characteristic equation has two distinct real roots <m>r_1</m> and <m>r_2</m>. The general solution is:
					<me> y = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x} </me>
				</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>Case 2: Repeated Real Roots (<m>\Delta = 0</m>)</b>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta = 0</m>, the characteristic equation has one repeated real root <m>r</m>. The general solution is:
					<me> y = (C_1 + C_2 x) e^{r x} </me>
				</p>
				</li>
				<li><b>Case 3: Complex Roots (<m>\Delta < 0</m>)</b>
				<p>
					If <m>\Delta < 0</m>, the characteristic equation has two complex conjugate roots <m>r = \alpha \pm \beta i</m>. The general solution is:
					<me> y = e^{\alpha x} (C_1 \cos(\beta x) + C_2 \sin(\beta x)) </me>
				</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</assemblage>
		
		<example>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Let's solve the second-order LHCC equation:
				</p>
				<me> y'' - 5y' + 6y = 0 </me>.

			<solution>
				<p>
					First, write down the characteristic equation:

				<md>
					<mrow> r^2 - 5r + 6 = 0 </mrow>

					Solving for <m>r</m> gives two distinct real roots:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> r = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad r = 3 </mrow>
				</md>.
				<p>
					Therefore, the general solution is:

		</example>
		
		<example>
			<statement>

					The characteristic equation is:
				</p>
				<md>
					<mrow> r^2 + 4r + 4 = 0 </mrow>

		<p>
			By recognizing the type of roots the characteristic equation has, we can determine the form of the general solution to any second-order LHCC equation. This method is powerful and provides a systematic approach to solving these equations.

	<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Higher-Order LHCC Equations </title>

		<introduction>
		  <p>
			Having explored first and second-order LHCC equations, we now extend our understanding to higher-order LHCC equations. These equations follow the same principles but involve higher derivatives, making the characteristic equations more complex. We'll look at some examples where the characteristic equations are relatively simple to solve. However, it's important to note that solving polynomial equations of high degree can be challenging, and technology often plays a crucial role in finding solutions.
		  </p>
		</introduction>
		
		<p>
		  A higher-order LHCC equation has the general form:
		  <me> a_n y^{(n)} + a_{n-1} y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1 y' + a_0 y = 0 </me>.
		  Here, <m>a_n, a_{n-1}, \ldots, a_1, a_0</m> are constants. To solve this equation, we follow the same process: assume a solution of the form <m>y = e^{rx}</m> and substitute it into the differential equation to obtain the characteristic equation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  The characteristic equation for an <m>n</m>-th order LHCC equation is:
		  <me> a_n r^n + a_{n-1} r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 r + a_0 = 0 </me>.
		  The roots of this polynomial equation determine the general solution of the differential equation.
		</p>
		
		<example>
		  <statement>
			<p>
			  Let's solve a third-order LHCC equation:
			</p>
			<me> y''' - 6y'' + 11y' - 6y = 0 </me>.
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
			<p>
			  First, write down the characteristic equation:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r^3 - 6r^2 + 11r - 6 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Solving for <m>r</m>, we get three distinct real roots:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r = 1, \quad r = 2, \quad r = 3 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Therefore, the general solution is:
			</p>
			<me> y = C_1 e^{x} + C_2 e^{2x} + C_3 e^{3x} </me>.
		  </solution>
		</example>
		
		<example>
		  <statement>
			<p>
			  Consider another example, a fourth-order LHCC equation:
			</p>
			<me> y^{(4)} - 5y'' + 4y = 0 </me>.
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
			<p>
			  The characteristic equation is:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r^4 - 5r^2 + 4 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Let <m>u = r^2</m>, then we can rewrite the equation as:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> u^2 - 5u + 4 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Solving for <m>u</m>, we get:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> u = 1, \quad u = 4 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Thus, <m>r^2 = 1</m> gives <m>r = \pm 1</m>, and <m>r^2 = 4</m> gives <m>r = \pm 2</m>. The general solution is:
			</p>
			<me> y = C_1 e^{x} + C_2 e^{-x} + C_3 e^{2x} + C_4 e^{-2x} </me>.

		  As seen in these examples, solving the characteristic equation for higher-order LHCC equations follows the same principles as for lower-order equations. However, as the degree of the polynomial increases, solving the characteristic equation analytically can become impractical due to the complexity of the roots.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		  For higher-degree characteristic equations, numerical methods and computer algebra systems are typically employed to find the roots. Software tools like MATLAB, Mathematica, and even graphing calculators can assist in solving these polynomial equations, allowing us to focus on interpreting and utilizing the solutions.

		<example>
		  <statement>
			<p>
			  Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:
			</p>
			<me> y^{(5)} - 4y''' + 3y'' - y = 0 </me>.
		  </statement>
		  <solution>
			<p>
			  The characteristic equation is:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r^5 - 4r^3 + 3r^2 - 1 = 0 </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  Solving this polynomial equation analytically is challenging, so we use a numerical solver. The roots are found to be approximately:
			</p>
			<md>
			  <mrow> r_1 = 1, \quad r_2 \approx 1.5, \quad r_3 \approx -1, \quad r_4 \approx 0.5 + 0.5i, \quad r_5 \approx 0.5 - 0.5i </mrow>
			</md>.
			<p>
			  The general solution, incorporating these roots, is:
			</p>
			<me> y = C_1 e^{x} + C_2 e^{1.5x} + C_3 e^{-x} + e^{0.5x} (C_4 \cos(0.5x) + C_5 \sin(0.5x)) </me>.
		  </solution>
		</example>
		
		<p>
		  By recognizing the type of roots and using technology to solve higher-degree polynomials, we can extend our approach to solve any higher-order LHCC equation effectively.
