		The method discussed in this section does not have a formal name, but it is a common technique with a wide array of applications. For ease of discussion, we will refer to it as the "LHCC method."
		<fn>
			"LHCC" is an acronym indicating the properties of DE it solves. The properties are linear (L), homogeneous (H), and constant coefficients (CC).
