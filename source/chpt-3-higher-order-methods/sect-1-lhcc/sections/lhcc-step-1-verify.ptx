		<p>
			Since the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/> only solves linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients, we need to familiarize ourselves with these new terms. In this section, we will introduce these concepts and practice identifying which differential equations can be solved with the LHCC method.
