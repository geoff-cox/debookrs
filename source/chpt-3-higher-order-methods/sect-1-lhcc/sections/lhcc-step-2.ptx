			Now that you know how to identify which types of differential equations can be solved using the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/> (<xref text="custom" ref="lhcc-step1"> Step 1 </xref>), you are ready for the next step, which involves solving an equation linked to the differential equation we would like to solve. This equation is referred to as the characteristic equation and is the focus of this section.
