<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" xml:id="sec-lhcc-step-1-p2-h"><title> Homogeneous </title>

	<p>
		In this section, we are going to cover what it means for a differential equation to be linear and homogeneous. Then we 
	</p>

	<definition xml:id="def-lh">
		<statement>
			<p>
				A linear differential equation <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> is said to be <term> homogeneous </term> if <m>f(x) = 0</m> and <xref ref="lhcc-l-eqn"/> reduces to
				<men xml:id="def-lh-eqn">
					a_n(x)\ y^{(n)} + \cdots + a_2(x)\ y'' + a_1(x)\ y' + a_0(x)\ y = 0.
				</men>
			</p>
		</statement>
	</definition>

	<p>
		Before continuing, it is important to clarify that this definition specifically refers to a differential equation that is both linear and homogeneous, not homogeneous alone. The general definition for homogeneous will not be discussed here.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Select the linear differential equations that are homogeneous.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Solution
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		If we also say that the linear homogeneous differential equation in <xref ref="def-lh-eqn"/> has <xref ref="def-lcc" text="custom">constant coefficients</xref>, then <xref ref="def-lh-eqn"/> becomes
		<me>
			a_n\ y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\ y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2\ y'' + a_1\ y' + a_0\ y = 0,
		</me>
		which is equation <xref ref="lhcc-eqn"/> in the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/>.
	</p>

	<example>

		<p>
			Select the linear differential equations that are homogeneous and have constant coefficients.
			<md>
				<mrow> \amp </mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Solution
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

	<p>
		At this point, you should be able to identify when a differential equation is linear, homogeneous, and has constant coefficients, which is the <xref text="custom" ref="lhcc-step1"> first step </xref> in applying the <xref ref="lhcc-method" text="title"/>.
