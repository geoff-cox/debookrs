  <p>
	Images like the ones above have been frequently shared on social media, prompting this mathematician to
	reflect that algebra seems more palatable when it's disguised as puzzles involving food.

  <p>
	Most of the images in the collage above also contain an element of competitiveness <mdash/> of being
	able to figure out something that other people have a hard time with.<fn>Many of the puzzles in the collage
	  say something like <q>Only 1 in 7 can solve this!</q> or <q>95% of people will fail to answer.</q> </fn>
	  Many of them also contain a visual trick which causes extra confusion or controversy.
	  For example, consider the puzzle in this image.

	The food puzzle above was really setting up a number of algebraic equations.
  </p>
  <tabular>
	<row>
	  <cell>Three apples add up to 18.</cell>
	  <cell><m>3A=18</m></cell>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <cell>Apple plus 2 bunches of bananas equals 14.</cell>
	  <cell><m>A+2B=14</m></cell>
	</row>
	<row>
	  <cell>Bunch of bananas minus cherries equals 2.</cell>
	  <cell><m>B-C=2</m></cell>
	</row>
  </tabular>
  <p>
	Solving the puzzle meant finding values for each of the foods that made all the equations true, that is,
	finding the values of <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.<fn>And then also realizing that the picture of
	  <q>bunch of bananas</q> changed so that we really needed to find the value of each banana.</fn>
  </p>
  <p>
	Almost all the food puzzles are these same kinds of equations, called <em>linear equations</em>.  Before
	defining what that means in general, let's explore another example from both graphical and algebraic perspectives.

  <example><title> Sony and The Interview </title>
	<statement>
	  <p>
		Below is an image from a New York Times article about a movie <em>The Interview</em>
	  </p>
	  <image width="90%" source="timestheinterview.svg">
		<shortdescription>Snapshot of part of an article from a major news source</shortdescription>
	  </image>
	  <p>
		The article is about the release of the movie, which generated controversy and so was released direct to streaming.
		Sony reported that the movie made about 15 million dollars total, split between $15 sales and $6 rentals, and also that
		there were about 2 million transactions in total
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Then the author of the article claimed that Sony did not release how many of the transactions were rentals and how many were sales.
		Can you do better than the author of the article and figure out how many of the transactions were sales and how many were rentals?
	  </p>
	</statement>
	<hint>
	  <p>
		Try using <m>x</m> for the number of sales and <m>y</m> for the number
		of rentals. What equations do you get from the information about the total number of transactions, and total
		dollar amount earned? Perhaps refer to <xref ref="act_sony-interview"/>.
	  </p>
	</hint>
	<solution>
	  <p>
		If <m>x</m> is the number of sales and <m>y</m> is the number of rentals, then <m>x+y=2</m> million transactions.
		Also, <m>15x+6y=15</m> million dollars of revenue, since each sale cost $15 and each rental cost $6.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We can solve this set of two linear equations by <em>substitution</em>: solving for one of the variables and substituting it into
		the other equation.  Rearranging the first equation we get that <me>y=2-x</me>, and then plugging that in for <m>y</m>
		in the second equation gives <me>15x+6(2-x)=15</me>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Multiplying out gives <me>15x+12-6x=15</me>, and combining like-terms results in <me>9x+12=15</me>.
		Subtracting the 12 from both sides gives <me>9x=3</me>, and dividing both sides by 9 yields <me>x=\frac{1}{3}</me>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		So one-third of a million, or roughly <m>333,333</m> transactions were sales.  To find the number of rentals,
		we can substitute this value back into either equation, but <m>x+y=2</m> seems easier. Then <me>\frac{1}{3}+y=2</me>,
		which means that <me>y=2-\frac{1}{3}=\frac{5}{3}</me>, and <m>\frac{5}{3}</m> of a million is roughly <m>1,666,667</m> transactions.
	  </p>

  <example xml:id="ex_by_hand">
	<title> Jar of multicolored marbles </title>
	  <statement>
	  <p>
		Suppose a jar contains red, blue and green marbles.
		You are told that there are a total of <m>30</m> marbles in the jar;
		there are twice as many red marbles as green ones;
		the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum of the red and green marbles.
		How many marbles of each color are there?
	  </p>
	  </statement>
	  <solution>
	  <p>
		Let's let <m>r</m> represent the number of red marbles,
		and let <m>b</m> and <m>g</m> denote the number of blue and green marbles,
		respectively.
		We can use the given statements about the marbles in the jar to create some equations.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Since we know there are <m>30</m> marbles in the jar, we know that
		<men xml:id="eq_rbg30">
		  r+b+g=30
		</men>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Also, we are told that there are twice as many red marbles as green ones,
		so we know that
		<men xml:id="eq_r2g">
		  r=2g
		</men>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		Finally, we know that the number of blue marbles is the same as the sum of the red and green marbles,
		so we have
		<men xml:id="eq_brg">
		  b = r+g
		</men>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		There are <em>many</em> ways to use this information to find the solution.
		One way is to combine ideas from <xref ref="eq_r2g">equations</xref>
		and <xref ref="eq_brg"></xref>;
		in <xref ref="eq_brg"></xref> replace <m>r</m> with <m>2g</m>.
		This gives us
		<men xml:id="eq_b3g">
		  b = 2g+g = 3g
		</men>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We can then combine <xref ref="eq_rbg30">equations</xref>,
		<xref ref="eq_r2g"></xref> and <xref ref="eq_b3g"></xref>
		by replacing <m>r</m> in <xref ref="eq_rbg30"></xref>
		with <m>2g</m> as we did before,
		and replacing <m>b</m> with <m>3g</m> to get
		<md>
		  <mrow>r+b+g \amp = 30</mrow>
		  <mrow>2g + 3g+g \amp =30</mrow>
		  <mrow>6g\amp =30</mrow>
		  <mrow number="yes" xml:id="eq_g5">g\amp =5</mrow>
		</md>
	  </p>
	  <p>
		We can now use <xref ref="eq_g5">equation</xref>
		to find <m>r</m> and <m>b</m>;
		we know from <xref ref="eq_r2g"></xref> that
		<m>r = 2g = 10</m> and then since <m>r+b+g = 30</m>,
		we easily find that <m>b = 15</m>.
	  </p>
	</solution>
  </example>

  <p>
	All of the examples we've seen so far have involved <em>linear equations</em>. It turns out that
	linear equations are at the heart of many modern applications: data science, sports analytics, graphics,
	machine learning, artificial intelligence, and so on.  Let's define what linear equations are.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_lin_eq"><title> Linear Equation </title>
	<statement>
	  <p>
		A <term>linear equation</term> is an equation that can be written in the form
		<me>
		  a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n = c
		</me>
		where the <m>x_i</m> are variables (the unknowns), the <m>a_i</m> are coefficients (numbers), and <m>c</m> is a constant.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		A <term>system of linear equations</term>
		is a set of linear equations that involve the same variables.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		A <term>solution</term> to a system of linear equations is a set of values for the variables <m>x_i</m> such that each equation in the system is satisfied.
	  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
	So in <xref ref="ex_by_hand">Example</xref>, when we answered
	<q>how many marbles of each color are there?,</q> we were also answering
	<q>find a solution to a certain system of linear equations.</q>

  <!-- <p>
	The following are examples of linear equations:
	<md>
	  <mrow>2x+3y-7z\amp =29</mrow>
	  <mrow>x_1+\frac72x_2+x_3-x_4+17x_5\amp =\sqrt[3]{-10}</mrow>
	  <mrow>y_1+14^2y_4+4\amp =y_2+13-y_1</mrow>
	  <mrow>\sqrt{7}r+\pi s +\frac{3t}{5}\amp = \cos(45^\circ)</mrow>
	</md>
  </p>
  <p>
	Notice that the coefficients and constants can be fractions and irrational numbers (like <m>\pi</m>, <m>\sqrt[3]{-10}</m> and
	<m>\cos(45^\circ)</m>).
	The variables only come in the form of <m>a_ix_i</m>;
	that is, just one variable multiplied by a coefficient.
	(Note that <m>\frac{3t}{5} = \frac{3}{5}t</m>, just a variable multiplied by a coefficient.)
	Also, it doesn't really matter what side of the equation we put the variables and the constants,
	although most of the time we write them with the variables on the left and the constants on the right.
  </p>
  <p>
	We would not regard the above collection of equations to constitute a system of equations,
	since each equation uses differently named variables.
  </p>-->

  <p>
	An example of a system of linear equations is
	<md>
	  <mrow>x_1-x_2+x_3+x_4\amp =1</mrow>
	  <mrow>2x_1+3x_2+x_4 \amp = 25</mrow>
	  <mrow>x_2+x_3\amp =10</mrow>
	</md>
  </p>
  <p>
	It is important to notice that not all equations used all of the variables
	(it is more accurate to say that the coefficients can be <m>0</m>, so the last equation could have been written as <m>0x_1+x_2+x_3+0x_4 = 10</m>).
	Also, just because we have four unknowns does not mean we have to have four equations.
	We could have had fewer, even just one,
	and we could have had more.
  </p>
  <!--<p>
	To get a better feel for what a linear equation is,
	we point out some examples of what are
	<em>not</em> linear equations.
	<md>
	  <mrow>2xy+z\amp =1</mrow>
	  <mrow>5x^2+2y^5\amp =100</mrow>
	  <mrow>\frac1x+\sqrt{y}+24z\amp =3</mrow>
	  <mrow>\sin^2x_1+\cos^2x_2 \amp = 29</mrow>
	  <mrow>2^{x_1} + \ln x_2 \amp = 13</mrow>
	</md>
  </p>
  <p>
	The first example is not a linear equation since the variables <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are multiplied together.
	The second is not a linear equation because the variables are raised to powers other than 1;
	that is also a problem in the third equation
	(remember that <m>1/x = x^{-1}</m> and <m>\sqrt{x} = x^{1/2}</m>).
	Our variables cannot be the argument of function like <m>\sin</m>,
	<m>\cos</m> or <m>\ln</m>, nor can our variables be raised as an exponent.
  </p> -->

  <p>
	At this stage, we have yet to discuss how to <em>efficiently</em> find a solution to a system of linear equations.
	That is a goal for the upcoming sections.
	Right now we focus on identifying linear equations and solving some smaller systems of equations using substitution.

		  <em>Linear equations</em> are equations which can be written in the form <me>a_1x_1+a_2x_2+\cdots+a_nx_n = c</me>,
		  where the <m>x_i</m> are variables, the <m>a_i</m> are coefficients, and <m>c</m> is a constant.

		  A <em>system of linear equations</em> is a set of linear equations referring to the same variables.  <em>Solving a system</em>
		  of linear equations means finding values for the variables such that all the equations are true with those values.

		  Systems of linear equations are behind many important applications in physics, engineering, and computer science,
		  and solving linear systems will be a significant part of this course.  For now though, we use <em>substitution</em> and wait for a better way.
