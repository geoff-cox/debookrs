		Every linear differential equation looks like
		<me> 
			a_n(x)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}(x)y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_2(x)y'' + a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
		</me>.
		The first-order version of this is
		<me> 
			a_1(x)y' + a_0(x)y = f(x)
		</me>,
		but we can divide both sides of this equation by <m>a_1(x)</m>, like so
		<me>
			y' + \us{P(x)}{\ub{\frac{a_0(x)}{a_1(x)}}}y = \us{Q(x)}{\ub{\frac{f(x)}{a_1(x)}}}
		</me>.
		Since every first-order linear differential equations can always be written as
		<me> 
			y' + P(x)y = Q(x) 
		</me>,
		we call this the first-order linear <em>standard form</em>.
