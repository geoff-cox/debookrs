		An effective way to deepen your understanding of solutions is through visualization. Even though a family of solutions includes infinitely many curves, plotting just a few helps reveal how the general solution, particular solutions, and initial conditions are related.
	</p>

	<p>
		Think of a family of solutions like a map full of side-by-side paths. The map shows all possible routes a traveler could take, each one representing a particular solution. The general solution defines the layout of all these paths, and choosing an initial condition is like dropping a pin on the map: the curve that passes through that point is the specific path (or solution) you follow.

			Consider the differential equation:
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x,
			</me>
			which has the general solution:
			<me>
				y = c e^{x^2} + 3.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the constant <m>c</m> can take any value, there are many possible solutions (green curves in <xref ref="visualizing-solutions-fig"/>). Adjust the initial condition (i.e., point on the <m>y</m>-axis) to see the specific solutions it corresponds to (blue curve).
