		<title>Solutions to Algebraic Equations</title>

		<p>
			In algebra, we say that a value <em>satisfies</em> an equation if, when we substitute that value in place of the variable, it makes both sides of the equation equal. This gives a true statement, like <m>0=0</m> or <m>1=1</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, consider the equation:
			<me>
				y^3 = 3y + 2.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's check whether <m>y = 2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> are solutions by substituting them into the equation. Plugging them in, we get:
		</p>

		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> (2)^3	\amp = 3(2) + 2 </mrow>
					<mrow> 8		\amp = 6 + 2 </mrow>
					<mrow> 8		\amp = 8 \quad ✅</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> (0)^3	\amp = 3(0) + 2 </mrow>
					<mrow> 0		\amp = 0 + 2 </mrow>
					<mrow> 0		\amp \ne 2 \quad ❌</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			Since <m>8 = 8</m> is a true statement, <m>y = 2</m> satisfies the equation and is a solution. On the other hand, <m>y = 0</m> leads to a false statement (<m>0 = 2</m>), showing that it is not a solution.

		<title>Solutions to Differential Equations</title>

		<p>
			In differential equations, solutions are <em>functions</em> rather than single values. To verify a solution, we substitute the function into the dependent variable in the equation. If both sides simplify to the same expression, then the function is a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, consider the differential equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			y' = 3y.
		</me>

		<p>
			To check whether <m>y = x^3</m> or <m>y = e^{3x}</m> is a solution, we substitute each into the equation and compare both sides. In this case, we get:
		</p>

		<sidebyside>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[x^3\right]'	\amp = 3(x^3) </mrow>
					<mrow> 3x^2					\amp \ne 3x^3 \quad ❌</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
			<p>
				<md>
					<mrow> \left[e^{3x}\right]'	\amp = 3(e^{3x}) </mrow>
					<mrow> 3e^{3x}				\amp = 3e^{3x} \quad ✅</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			For differential equations, a solution satisfies the equation if both sides simplify to the <em>exact</em> same function.
			Since this only happened for the second function, we can conclude that <m>y = e^{3x}</m> is a solution, while <m>y = x^3</m> is not.
