			An effective way to deepen your understanding of solutions is through visualization. Even though a family of solutions includes infinitely many curves, plotting just a few helps reveal how the general solution, particular solutions, and initial conditions are related.

		Think of a family of solutions like a map full of side-by-side paths. The map shows all possible routes a traveler could take, each one representing a particular solution. The general solution defines the layout of all these paths, and choosing an initial condition is like dropping a pin on the map: the curve that passes through that point is the specific path (or solution) you follow.

			Consider the differential equation:
			<men xml:id="eqn-visualizing-solutions-1">
				\frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x,
			</men>
			which has the general solution:
			<me>
				y = c e^{x^2} + 3.
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Here, the constant <m>c</m> can be any real number. That gives us a family of solutions, one curve for each value of <m>c</m>. To see this, check out the following interactive figure.

			Adjust the initial condition in the interactive figure to help you answer the following:
					
			<task label="chkpt-visualizing-solutions-10"><title> Find the particular solution that passes through <m>(0,5)</m> </title>
				<statement>Use the figure to determine the particular solution of <m>y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> that passes through the point <m>(0,5)</m>?</statement>
				<choices randomize="yes">
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad\ds y = -2e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. The value of <m>c</m> must make the solution pass through <m>(0, 5)</m>. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad\ds y = 0.5e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. Remember that at <m>x = 0</m>, the exponential term <m>e^{x^2}</m> equals 1, so <m>y(0) = c + 3</m>. What value of <m>c</m> gives <m>y(0) = 5</m>? Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice correct="yes">
						<statement><m>\quad\ds y = 2e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
						<feedback>Correct! The value <m>c = 2</m> ensures that <m>y(0) = 2 + 3 = 5</m>, so this solution passes through <m>(0, 5)</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad\ds y = 5e^{x^2}+3</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. The general solution would pass through <m>(0, 4)</m> if <m>c = 1</m>. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(0,5)</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
				</choices>
			</task>

			<task label="chkpt-visualizing-solutions-20"><title> Find <m>c</m> for the particular solution that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> </title>
				<statement>Adjust the initial condition to determine the value of <m>c</m> that corresponds to the particular solution that passes through the point <m>(1,1)</m>?</statement>
				<choices randomize="yes">
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad c = -2</m></statement>

					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad c = 0.5</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> and look at the coefficient on <m>e^{x^2}</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad c = 2</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. Hover over the curve in the figure that passes through <m>(1,1)</m> and look at the coefficient on <m>e^{x^2}</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice correct="yes">
						<statement><m>\quad c = -1</m></statement>
						<feedback>Correct! Hovering over the curve passing through <m>(1,1)</m> shows the particular solution <m>\ds y = -e^{x^2}+3</m>, so <m>c=1</m>.</feedback>

			<task label="chkpt-visualizing-solutions-40"><title> Does the solution with <m>c=-1</m> pass through the origin? </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Does the particular solution corresponding to <m>c = -1</m> passes through the origin, <m>(0, 0)</m>?
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>You can answer this with or without adjusting the figure.</em>
					</p>
				</statement>
				<choices randomize="yes">
					<choice>
						<statement>Yes</statement>
						<feedback>
							Incorrect. Try recalculating <m>y(0)</m> when <m>c = -1</m>. Which point does it pass through on the <m>y</m>-axis?
						</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice correct="yes">
						<statement>No</statement>
						<feedback>
							Correct. If <m>c = -1</m>, then <m>y(0) = -1 + 3 = 2</m>, which passes through <m>(0,2)</m>.

			<task label="chkpt-visualizing-solutions-50"><title> A solution that satisfies <m>y(1) = 3</m> also satisfies which condition? </title>
				<statement>A solution that satisfies <m>y(1) = 3</m> also satisfies which condition?</statement>
				<choices randomize="yes">
					<choice correct="yes">
						<statement><m>\quad y(5)=3</m></statement>
						<feedback>Correct! The graph of the solution that satisfies <m>y(1) = 3</m> is a horizontal line at <m>y=3</m> so it satisfies <m>y(5) = 3</m>.</feedback>
					</choice>
					<choice>
						<statement><m>\quad y(1)=0</m></statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. The solution does not satisfy <m>y(1)=0</m>.</feedback>

						<feedback>Incorrect. The solution does not satisfy <m>y(0)=0</m>.</feedback>

				<statement>What role do initial conditions play in solving differential equations?</statement>
				<choices randomize="yes">
					<choice>
						<statement>They determine the general form of the solution.</statement>
						<feedback>Incorrect. Initial conditions are not used to find the general solution.</feedback>

						<feedback>Correct! Initial conditions are used to find the specific solution that applies to a particular scenario.</feedback>
