  <title>Separation of Variables</title>
  <label>chap-separation-variables</label>
  <overview>Introduces the separation of variables method for solving first-order differential equations, starting with how to recognize separable equations, then applying the method systematically, and handling nuances like implicit solutions and absolute values.</overview>
  <dependencies>Requires knowledge of basic differential equation concepts and calculus techniques like integration, substitution, and algebraic manipulation.</dependencies>
</METADATA>

<overview>
  <p>Some differential equations are nice enough to let us peel apart the variables, solve each side separately, and reassemble the solution. This chapter explores those equations and the method of separation of variables, which turns them into solvable integrals.</p>
