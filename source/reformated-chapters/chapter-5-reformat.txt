  <title>Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient Equations</title>
  <label>chap-lhcc</label>
  <overview>Explores linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients (LHCC), showing why exponentials arise as natural solutions, how the characteristic equation determines the solution structure, and how to handle second- and higher-order cases.</overview>
  <dependencies>Assumes understanding of linearity, homogeneity, derivatives, and exponential functions, as well as familiarity with earlier solution methods like separation of variables and integrating factors.</dependencies>

<overview>
  <p>Some of the most important differential equations you’ll see are linear, homogeneous, and have constant coefficients — known as LHCC equations. This chapter shows how these equations work, why exponentials are the key to solving them, and how to systematically build solutions for second-order and higher-order cases.</p>
