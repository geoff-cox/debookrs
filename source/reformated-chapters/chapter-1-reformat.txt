<overview>
  <p>This chapter answers a deceptively simple question: what is a differential equation? We’ll start by connecting it to algebra and calculus, provide a clear definition, and break down its essential components like terms, coefficients, and order.</p>

  <section label="whats-a-de">
    <title>What is a Differential Equation?</title>
    <overview>Explains the concept of a differential equation, starting from algebraic roots and moving to a formal definition.</overview>

    <examples>
      <example role="algebra-connection">
        <title>Connecting Algebra and DEs</title>
        <statement>Show how solving y' + 2t = 11 is like solving an algebraic equation, but using calculus tools.</statement>
      </example>
    </examples>

    <section-summary>
      <ul>
        <li>A differential equation contains an unknown function and at least one derivative.</li>
        <li>Identifying it often starts with recognizing the derivative notation and the equals sign.</li>
      </ul>

  <section label="de-components">
    <title>Differential Equation Components</title>
    <overview>Breaks down what makes up a differential equation: variables, terms, and coefficients.</overview>

    <examples>
      <example role="identify-variables">
        <title>Dependent vs. Independent Variables</title>
        <statement>Identify dependent and independent variables in example equations like dP/ds + P/s^2 = 17s.</statement>
      </example>
    </examples>

    <section-summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The dependent variable is the unknown we solve for; the independent variable is what it depends on.</li>
        <li>Terms can involve the dependent variable, its derivatives, or just constants.</li>
        <li>Coefficients multiply the dependent variable or its derivatives and depend only on the independent variable.</li>
      </ul>

  <section label="order-linearity">
    <title>Order & Linearity</title>
    <overview>Introduces the classification of differential equations by order (highest derivative) and linearity (how the dependent variable appears).</overview>

    <examples>
      <example role="identify-order">
        <title>Identify the Order</title>
        <statement>Classify given DEs by their highest derivative, such as y''' + 3y' - 4y = 0.</statement>
      </example>
      <example role="linear-vs-nonlinear">
        <title>Linear or Nonlinear?</title>
        <statement>Analyze DEs and determine if any terms make them nonlinear.</statement>
      </example>
    </examples>

    <section-summary>
      <ul>
        <li>The order of a DE is the highest derivative present.</li>
        <li>Linear terms contain the dependent variable or derivatives to the first power, not inside other functions.</li>
        <li>A DE is nonlinear if even one term breaks that rule.</li>
      </ul>

<cheatsheet>
  <formula>Order = highest derivative; Linearity requires all terms involving the dependent variable to be linear.</formula>
  <workflow>Recognize → Identify components → Classify by order → Classify by linearity</workflow>
  <alerts>Watch for exponents on y or derivatives hidden inside functions — they usually signal nonlinearity.</alerts>
