	<p>
		Up to this point, we've focused on finding exact solutions to differential equations. By <q>exact</q>, we mean solutions that are expressed in terms of standard mathematical functions, like <m>y(t) = e^{-3t} \sin(2t)</m>. This kind of solution is called an <term>analytic solution</term> and is sometimes referred to as a <term>closed-form solution</term> ,  meaning it is expressed using standard mathematical symbols and functions. These formula-like solutions are valuable because you can plug in <em>any</em> <m>t</m>-value to get the <em>exact</em> <m>y</m>-value.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, many differential equations, such as
	</p>

	<me>
		y' = e^{-y^2}, \quad y(0) = 0.
	</me>

	<p>
		do not have a nice closed-form solution. In cases like these, we turn to a different kind of tool: a <term>numerical method</term>. This approach doesn't give you a formula for <m>y(t)</m> ,  instead, it starts with a known value and repeatedly uses the differential equation to estimate the next one ,  one step at a time. We call this a <term>numerical solution</term>.
	</p>

	<note><title> How does this process work? </title>
		<p> 
			To compute a numerical solution, we typically follow a simple idea: we start with an initial value, then use the differential equation to estimate what happens shortly afterward, then repeat the process. The next few subsections will show how this is done ,  step-by-step.

		<p>
			Graphically, the analytic solution <m>y(t)=e^t</m> is represented by a continuous curve, while the numerical solution is a collection of points. And unlike analytic methods, numerical methods work even when no formula exists.
		</p>

		<note><title> Precision vs Practicality </title>
			<p>
				Remember: a numerical solution is just an estimate. It won't be perfect, but it's often good enough ,  and it's sometimes the only option we have. This tradeoff between exactness and usability is a recurring theme in numerical methods.

	<paragraphs><title> Why Do We Need Numerical Methods? </title>
		<p>
			After comparing the two types of solutions, it might seem like analytic solutions are always better than numerical ones. However, even when a closed-form solution exists, there are many reasons why numerical methods are useful ,  and often preferred. Here are just a few:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>A closed-form solution may be very difficult or even impossible to find.</li>
			<li>Outside of an academic setting, it is rare to solve a differential equation by hand.</li>
			<li>In real-world applications, solving an equation is typically just one step in a larger computational pipeline.</li>
			<li>Numerical methods are easier to adjust when your equation changes.</li>
		</ol>

		<exercise><title>Why use numerical methods?</title>
			<statement>
				Which of the following are good reasons to use a numerical method?
			</statement>
			<choices randomize="yes" select="multiple">
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>
						They can approximate a solution when no closed-form solution exists.
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						This is True ,  numerical methods are often the only way to find a solution when no closed-form solution exists.
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>
						They can be automated on a computer.
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						This is True ,  numerical methods are ideal for computer-based simulation and analysis.
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice correct="yes">
					<statement>
						They are easier to adjust when the form of the equation changes.
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						This is True ,  they are often more flexible and adaptable than symbolic techniques.
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>
						They take less time to compute.
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						This is not necessarily true ,  Closed-form solutions may be easy to find depending on the equation. Unless you have already setup a computer to solve an equation numerically, a numerical method has a significant initial investment.
					</feedback>
				</choice>
				<choice>
					<statement>
						They produce more accurate solutions than analytic methods.
					</statement>
					<feedback>
						This is not true ,  In fact, it is likely the biggest drawback of numerical methods. Since numerical solutions are approximations, they always introduce some amount of error (albeit, usually very small). Analytic solutions, on the other hand, are exact when they exist.
