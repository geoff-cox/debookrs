				<p>
					This is a bit of a trick question to remind you of the first-order requirement of a separable equation. Since this equation is second-order, <em>separability does not apply</em>.
				</p>
			</solution>

			<solution><title> <term>Isolate the Derivative First</term> </title>
				<p>
					To see that this equation is separable, we need to check that it can be rearranged in <xref ref="separable" text="custom">separable form</xref>. Isolating <m> s' </m> we get
					<me> s' = \frac{s + t}{s} </me>
					and it should be clear that there is no way to separate <m>t</m> and <m>s</m> by <em>multiplication</em> in the numerator, so this equation <em>is not separable</em>.
				</p>
			</solution>

			<solution><title> <term>Everything but the Kitchen Sink</term> </title>

				<p>
					This example uses a little of everything we discussed, so strap in. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Noticing that the equation is first-order, we start by isolating <m>dy/dx</m>
					<md>
						<mrow>
							y\frac{dy}{dx} + 8x^2e^{x + \cos y} = 6x^2e^x 
						</mrow>
						<mrow>
							\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{6x^2e^x - 8x^2e^{x + \cos y}}{y}
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					Next, we can rewrite the exponent in the numerator as a product
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{6x^2e^x - 8x^2e^{x}e^{\cos y}}{y}
					</me>
					and recognize that there is a common factor in the numerator
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2x^2e^x(3 - 4e^{\cos y})}{y}
					</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					From here, we write the result as a product of fractions,
					<me>
						\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{2x^2e^x}{1} \cdot \frac{3 - 4e^{\cos y}}{y} 
					</me>,
					and see that the equation is now <em>separable</em>.
				</p>

	<example><title> Verify our solution </title>

		<p>
			<p>
				Verify that 
				<me>z = \tan(t+C)</me>
				is the particular solution to the initial value problem
				<me>z' - 1 = z^2, \quad z(4) = 9</me>
			</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					As in the previous example, we don't have to check our answer, but one of the best parts about DEs is that we always can check, which means we can really know if we have the right solution. Let's check this one. We will substitute our solution back into the DE and verify that when we do, we get the same thing on both sides of the equation.
		
					<md>
						<mrow> LHS	=\amp\ z' -1</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \frac{d}{dt}\Big( \tan(t+C) \Big) - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \sec^2(t+C)\cdot \frac{d}{dt}(t+C) - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \sec^2(t+C)\cdot (1+0) - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \sec^2(t+C) - 1</mrow>
					</md>
		
					<md>
						<mrow> RHS	=\amp\ z^2</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \Big( \tan(t+C) \Big)^2</mrow>
						<mrow> =\amp\ \tan^2(t+C)</mrow>
					</md>
		
				</p>
		
				<p>
					At first glance, it looks like we have different expressions on the left and right hand sides of the equation. However, if we recall the trigonometric identity
		
						<me>\tan^2 x = \sec^2 x - 1,</me>
		
					then we can see that these expressions are, in fact equivalent. Thus, we have verified that <m>z = \tan(t+C)</m>, where <m>C</m> is any constant, is a solution to the DE <m>z' -1 = z^2</m>.
				</p>
		
				<p>
					Now that we've practiced this solution technique a couple of times, let's summarize.
				</p>
			</solution>
		</p>

	</example>

	<example>

		<p>
			<p>
				Solve the following initial value problem.
				<me>\frac{dz}{dy} - yz = y, \hspace{1cm} z(0) = 5</me>
			</p>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<solution>
				<p>
					It's always worth it when you first start solving DEs to step back and make sure you identify independent and dependent variables. Here <m>z</m> is dependent and <m>y</m> is independent. That means when we're done we hope to have a function
					<me>
					z = \underbrace{\hspace{4.0cm}}_{\text{some function of } y}
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					Also, even though the terminology we use is <em>initial</em> condition, we typically won't use that piece of information until the very end.

					<aside>
						<p>
							* Until we get to Laplace Transforms...
						</p>
					</aside>
				</p>

				<p>
					First let's verify that the DE is first order (it is!), and then we go about solving for the derivative.
					<md>
						<mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} - yz	=\amp\ y</mrow>
						<mrow> \frac{dz}{dy} 	=\amp\ y + yz</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now that we have solved for the derivative, is it possible write the right hand side of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, <m>z</m> and the other function does not contain the independent variable, <m>y</m>?  That is, we'd like to write the DE in the form suggested below.
					<me>
						\frac{dz}{dy} = \Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no z's}} \Big) \cdot
						\Big( \underbrace{\hspace{2.0cm}}_{\mbox{no x's}} \Big)
					</me>
					Hopefully you can see that there is a way, by factoring <m>y</m> out of each term on the right hand side, as below.
					<me>\frac{dz}{dy} = y(1 + z)</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we need to completely separate variables.
					<me>\frac{1}{1+z}dz = ydy</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					The next step will be to integrate both sides of the equation. (If the integral on the right hand side is at all questionable to you, you should do take an extra step and actually do the substitution <m>u = 1+z.</m>)
					<md>
						<mrow> \int \frac{1}{1+z}dz	=\amp\ \int ydy</mrow>
						<mrow> \ln|1+z|	=\amp\ \frac{1}{2}y^2 + c</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					As before, we write only one constant of integration (recall that we're skipping a couple of steps here; details provided in Example 6).
				</p>

				<p>
					Remember that our goal is to solve for the unknown function <m>z</m>. Since it's currently inside of a logarithm, we exponentiate both sides of the equation.
					<md>
						<mrow> \ln|1+z|	=\amp\ \frac{1}{2}y^2 + c</mrow>
						<mrow> e^{\ln|1+z|}	=\amp\ e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2 + c}</mrow>
						<mrow> |1+z|	=\amp\ e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}\cdot e^c</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					We continue solving for <m>z</m>.
					<md>
						<mrow> 1+z	=\amp\ \underbrace{\pm e^c}_{\text{rename } A} \cdot e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}</mrow>
						<mrow> 1+z	=\amp\ Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2}		</mrow>
						<mrow> z	=\amp\ Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					Now we can use that initial condition, <m>z(0) = 5</m>, to solve for <m>A</m>. The initial condition can be read,
					"when <m>y</m> is zero, <m>z</m> is 5."  We substitute into our solution accordingly.
					<md>
						<mrow> z	=\amp\ Ae^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> 5	=\amp\ Ae^{\frac{1}{2}\cdot 0^2} - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> 5	=\amp\ Ae^0 - 1</mrow>
						<mrow> 6	=\amp\ A\cdot 1</mrow>
						<mrow> 6	=\amp\ A</mrow>
					</md>
					<aside>
						<p>
							* mention that we can't call <m>A = 6</m> our solution!
						</p>
					</aside>
				</p>

				<p>
					Therefore, the solution to the IVP is
					<me>z = 6e^{\frac{1}{2}y^2} - 1.</me>
				</p>
			</solution>
