			<title> Textbook Aim &amp; Scope </title>
			
			<p>
				This book is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their applications. It covers the fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques used to solve ODEs, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving skills.
			</p>

			<p>
				This interactive online text is intended to be used to learn the introductory concepts of ordinary differential equations. The book is designed for students who have completed single-variable calculus and is suitable for a one semester course in differential equations. The book is written in a straightforward, readable style and has a large number of worked examples and exercises.

			<title> Intended Audience </title>
			
			<p>
				This book is intended for undergraduate students who are studying differential equations for the first time. It is designed to be accessible to students with a background in single-variable calculus, and it assumes no prior knowledge of differential equations. The book is suitable for use in a one-semester course on ordinary differential equations.

			<title> Philosophy </title>
			
			<p>
				We believe that the best way to learn differential equations is to work through examples and exercises. This book is designed to be interactive, allowing you to explore the concepts and methods of differential equations in a hands-on way. We encourage you to work through the examples and exercises, and to use the interactive features of the book to deepen your understanding.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also believe that it is important to understand the underlying concepts and methods of differential equations, rather than just memorizing formulas and techniques. This book is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of the subject, so that you can apply the concepts and methods to a wide range of problems.
			</p>
			<p>
				We hope that this book will be a valuable resource for you as you learn differential equations, and that it will help you develop the skills and understanding you need to succeed in your studies and future career.	
			</p>

			<title> Textbook Structure and Approach </title>
			
			<p>
				The book is structured to guide you through the process of solving differential equations, starting with the basic concepts and building up to more advanced techniques. Each section includes examples and exercises that illustrate the concepts and methods, and we encourage you to work through these examples and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of the material.
			</p>

			<p>
				Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.
