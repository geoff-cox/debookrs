		This chapter introduces the next solution method called the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em> (IF method). This important technique solves any first-order linear differential equation using a reversed version of the product rule followed by direct integration.

	<p>
		Recall, <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref> provides a straightforward way to solve differential equations when the equation can be written in the form:
	</p>

	<p>
		<me> \frac{d}{dx}[g(x,y)] = f(x) </me>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In such cases, solving the equation is as simple as integrating both sides with respect to <m>x</m>. As you will see in the discussion that follow, the integrating factor method is essentially a direct integration problem in disguise. The difference here is that you must perform an initial step to rewrite the differential equation into a form for which direct integration applies.
	</p>

	<p>
		The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The key idea is to multiply the differential equation by an integrating factor that simplifies it into a form that can be solved by direct integration. In the next sections, we will explore how this is done, step by step.
