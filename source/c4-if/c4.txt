<chapter><title> Integrating Factor </title>

	<introduction>
			
			<p>
				This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
			</p>

			<p>
				To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
			</men>

			<p>
				The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="di-eqn">
				\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
			</men>

			<p>
				Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.
			</p>

	</introduction>

	<section><title> Completing the Derivative </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Many algebraic equations can be solved by strategically grouping or combining terms. For example, consider the quadratic equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				x^2 + 10x + 25 = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				One way to solve this equation is by factoring the left-hand side:
			</p>

			<me>
				(x + 5)^2 = 0.
			</me>

			<p>
				This way of grouping is useful because it allows us to solve for <m>x</m> directly by taking a square root.
			</p> 

			<p>
				Certain <term>first-order differential equations</term> benefit from a similar strategy. Instead of grouping algebraic terms into a square, we restructure a differential equation so that one side appears as a <em>single derivative</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2 y = 5
			</me>

			<p>
				can be rewritten as:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} [e^{2x} y] = 5e^{2x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				This transformation is powerful because it allows us to solve for <m>y</m> using <em>direct integration</em>, just as factoring allowed us to solve for <m>x</m> in the quadratic example.
			</p>

			<p>
				For this discussion we will refer to this process as <term>completing the derivative</term>. It consists of two key steps:
			</p>

			<p>
				<line> 1️⃣ <term>Introducing a missing function</term> needed to bundle terms into a derivative.</line>
				<line> 2️⃣ <term>Applying the reverse product rule</term> to construct a combined derivative.</line>
			</p>

			<p>
				This section explores both of these crucial steps. We begin by reviewing how to recognize and reverse the product rule within a differential equation. Then, we introduce cases where an additional function is required before the derivative can be constructed.
			</p>

		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> The Product Rule: A Quick Review </title>

			<p>
				The <term>product rule</term> is a fundamental differentiation technique that describes how to differentiate a product of two functions. If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are differentiable, their derivative satisfies:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) g(x) \right] = f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				Let's warm up with a few examples to refresh our memory.
			</p>

			<example><title> Forward Product Rule </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Compute each of the derivatives below.
						</p>
						<me>
							1. \quad \left[x^6 e^{3x}\right]' \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^3} y(x)\right]
						</me>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the product rule:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds
										\left( x^6 e^{3x} \right)' =
										x^6 \cdot 3e^{3x} + 6x^5 e^{3x}
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}
										\left( e^{x^3} y(x) \right) =
										e^{x^3} y'(x) + 3x^2 e^{x^3} y(x)
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</solution>

		<subsection><title>Recognizing and Reversing the Product Rule</title>

			<p>
				Normally, we apply the product rule <em>in the forward direction</em>, starting with a product and differentiating it into separate terms. However, when solving differential equations, we often need to work <em>in reverse</em>—that is, given a sum of terms, we determine whether they originate from a product rule derivative. This process is crucial in the integrating factor method, where we aim to rewrite an equation so that one side is a derivative of a product.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, the expression:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{1}{x} \sin x + \cos x \ln x
			</me>

			<p>
				can be rewritten as:
			</p>

			<me>
				\left[ \sin x \cdot \ln x \right]'.
			</me>

			<p>
				The product rule expands the derivative of a product into two distinct terms:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f \cdot g \right] = \ul{f \cdot g'} + \ul{f' \cdot g}.
			</me>

			<p>
				Recognizing when a product rule can be reversed involves:
			</p>

			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Identifying two terms that could correspond to <m>f \cdot g'</m> and <m>f' \cdot g</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Choose candidate functions for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in separate terms.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Using your choices, test that <m>[f \cdot g]'</m> produces the original terms.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p>
				Let's practice these steps with a few examples.
			</p>

			<example><title> Basic Reverse Product Rule (ver 1) </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) g(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{x}\cos x + e^{x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>

							<p>
								First, select an <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in different terms, like so
							</p>

							<p>
								<me>
									e^x\
									\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\cos x}}}
									+
									\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
									\sin x
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								For this to work, <m>f'</m> should be <m>\sin x</m>, next to our choosen <m>g</m>. However,
								<me>
									f' = [\cos x]' = -\sin x
								</me>
							</p>

							<p>
								So this labeling doesn't work and we instead try the labels
							</p>

							<p>
								<me>
									\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
									\cos x
									+
									e^x\
									\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\sin x}}}
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								Noting that <m>f' = [e^x]' = e^x</m> is the other part of the second term and <m>g' = [\sin x]' = \cos x</m> is in the first term confirms this is a valid product rule. Therefore, we can reverse the product rule as
							</p>

							<me>
								e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x = [e^x \cos x]'
							</me>.


						</solution>

						<solution>

							<p>
								To make this easier, let's separate the terms as
								<me>
									\frac{1}{x} e^{x^2} + \ln x (2 x e^{x^2})
								</me>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								So, as before, we first set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{1}{x}\
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^{x^2}}}}
								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\ln x}}}\
								2 x e^{x^2}
							</me>,

							<p>
								then verify the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are in the other terms,
							</p>

							<me>
								f' = \left[e^{x^2}\right]' = 2 x e^{x^2} \quad ✅ \qquad g' = \left[\ln x\right]' = \frac{1}{x} \quad ✅
							</me>.

							<p>
								Therefore,
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2} = \left[e^{x^2} \ln x\right]'
							</me>.
						</solution>
					</p>
				</solution>
				
			</example>

			<example><title> Basic Reverse Product Rule </title>

									+
									\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
									\sin x
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								Based on these choices, we test <m>[f\cdot g]'</m>,
							</p>

							<me>
								[e^x \cos x]' = e^x \cos x + e^x (-\sin x) \neq e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x \quad ❌ 
							</me>
							
							<p>
								and see that this choice doesn't work. Switching our labels to
							</p>

							<me>
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
								\cos x
								+
								e^x\
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\sin x}}}
							</me>,

							<p>
								identifies the correct <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, since
							</p>

							<me>
								[e^x \sin x]' = e^x \sin x + e^x \cos x = e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x \quad ✅
							</me>.

							<p>
								Therefore, 
								<me>
									e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x = [e^x \cos x]' \vphantom{\frac11}
								</me>.
							</p>

						</solution>

						<solution>
							
							<p>
								First, rearrange the terms a bit and set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{1}{x}\cdot
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{e^{x^2}}{1}}}}
								+ 2 x 
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\ln x}}}\
								e^{x^2}
							</me>.

							<p>
								Next, verify the derivative of <m>f \cdot g</m>,
							</p>

							<me>
								\left[e^{x^2}\ln x\right]' = e^{x^2}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + e^{x^2}(2 x) \ln x \os{✅}{=} \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2}
							</me>.

							<p>
								Therefore,
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2} = \left[e^{x^2} \ln x\right]'
							</me>.
						</solution>

			</example>

			<p>
				The next example involves an expression that contains a variable, making it more relevant to differential equations.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="reversed-product-rule-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule with a Variable </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) y(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9y e^{9x} \hspace{5em} 2. \quad e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Since <m>dy/dx</m> and <m>y</m> are in separate terms, setting <m>g</m> to <m>y</m> gives you <m>g'</m> and <m>f</m> for free since
							</p>

							<me>
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{9x}}}}\
								\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}\
								(9 e^{9x})
							</me>.

							<p>
								The only thing you need to check is
								<me>
									f' = [e^{9x}]' = 9e^{9x} \quad ✅
								</me>
								which is sitting right next to <m>g</m>. Therefore, we have
							</p>

							<me>
								e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9 e^{9x} y = \left[e^{9x} y\right]'
							</me>.

						</solution>

						<solution>

							<p>
								Again, set <m>g</m> to <m>y</m> and the rest fall into place as

								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{1/x}}}}\
								\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y'}}}
								+
								\left(-\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}\right)\
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
							</me>.

							<p>
								The only thing left to do is verify the derivative of <m>f</m>:
								<me>
									f' = \left[e^{1/x}\right]' = e^{1/x}\left[\frac{1}{x}\right]^\prime = e^{1/x}\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2} \quad ✅
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								So, we can reverse the product rule as

							<me>
								e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y = \left[e^{1/x} y\right]'

				While reversing the product rule is not standard exercise, they are important for developing the intuition needed to understand the integrating factor method, as we will soon see.

		<subsection><title> A Complete Product Rule </title>

			<p>
				Now that you have seen how to combine two terms into a single derivative by reversing the product rule, you are ready to see how this could help you solve a differential equation. Suppose you are given the following equation
			</p>

			<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE">
				\ub{e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y}_{\text{expanded product rule?}} = 5e^{2x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				Seeing the two terms with a derivative suggests that it may be possible to apply a reverse product rule to the left side. In fact, it can and it is not hard to verify that equation <xref ref="reverse-product-rule-DE"/> is equivalent to
			</p>

			<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE-solution">
				\frac{d}{dx} [ e^{2x} y ] = 5e^{2x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				This transformation is powerful because it allows us to solve the equation through direct integration, as illustrated in the next example.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule in a Differential Equation </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find the general solution of the equation

							by rewriting the left-side as a single derivative and then direct integration.

					</statement>
				</p>

					</solution>
				</p>

			</example>

			<p>
				This example shows a differential equation that conveniently had all the pieces it needed to reverse the product rule. Unfortunately, equations are rarely presented in such a complete form and an additional component must be provided before an appoach like this will work. 
			</p>

			<p>
				To help us see how adding something to an equation can help us alter its form and solve it, we will first look at an analogy from algebra in the next section.
			</p>

		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> An Analogy: Completing the Square </title>

			<p>
				Suppose you wanted to solve the following quadratic equation
			</p>

			<men xml:id="quadratic-example">
				x^2 + 6x = -1.
			</men>

			<p>
				You could solve it using the quadratic formula. However, another approach is to <q>complete the square</q> by strategically placing a number on the left side which turns it into a perfect square. Following the rule from <q>completing the square</q>, we know <m>\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 9</m> does the trick, so we add it to both sides to get
			</p>

			<me>
				\ub{\os{{\large\text{incomplete}}}{\ob{x^2 + 6x}^{\large\text{square}}} + 9}_{\large\text{complete square}} = -1 + 9.
			</me>

			<p>
				Completing the square gets it name because it tells you the missing piece needed to factor our equation into the form
			</p>

			<men xml:id="perfect-square">
				(x + 3)^2 = 8.
			</men>

			<p>
				Now, taking a square root releases <m>x</m>, leading directly to the solutions
			</p>

			<me>
				x + 3 = \pm\sqrt{8} \quad \implies \quad x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
			</me>

			<p>
				Just as completing the square tells you that <m>9</m> is the missing piece that makes a <q>perfect</q> square in a quadratic equation, the integrating factor method tells you the missing piece you need to construct a <q>perfect</q> derivative in a differential equation.
			</p>

		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> An Incomplete Product Rule </title>

			<p>
				As mention to in the previous sections, most first-order linear differential equations must be modified before its terms can be combined into a single derivative. To make sense of this, we will look at a concrete example using the differential equation
			</p>

			<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="5% 15% 5% 45% 30%">

						\frac{dy}{dx} + 6y = -1
					</me>.
				</p>
				<p/>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				In this form, the left side resembles an expanded product rule, but if you attempt to reverse it you will see that no choice of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> will work. However, if you multiply both sides by <m>e^{6x}</m>, the equation becomes

				The inclusion of <m>e^{6x}</m> provides the missing piece needed to reverse a product rule and update the equation as

		<introduction>

			<p>
				In the previous section, we saw that rewriting a first-order linear differential equation so that one side is a <q>completed</q> derivative allows us to solve it using direct integration. However, many equations do not initially have this form.
			</p>

			<p>
				The key to overcoming this issue is finding a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that, when multiplied onto the equation, transforms it into a single derivative. That is, given the standard form:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-standard-form00">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x),
			</men>

			<p>
				we seek a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative">
				\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x).
			</men>

			<p>
				This section focuses on systematically determining <m>\mu(x)</m> for any first-order linear differential equation. We begin with an example that illustrates the core idea, then generalize the approach to derive a general formula.

			</p>

			<p>
				<line> ✅ A derivative can be <q>completed</q> in <em>any</em> first-order linear equation.</line>
				<line> ✅ The equation must be multiplied by a function to complete the derivative.</line>

				Now, let's explore how to find the integrating factor step by step.

		<subsection><title> A Motivating Example </title>
			
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In the previous section, we saw that certain first-order linear differential equations can be rewritten so that the left-hand side is a single derivative. However, most equations do not initially have this structure. Instead, they are missing a crucial function that allows us to apply the <em>product rule in reverse</em>.
				</p>

				<p>
					The goal now is to illustrate how to determine this missing function—known as the <term>integrating factor</term>—so that we can rewrite one of the sides as a single derivative.
				</p>

				<p>
					Consider the equation:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn">
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
				</men>

				<p>
					The claim is that the left side of this equation is currently an incomplete product rule that can be completed and reversed by multiplying a function <m>\mu</m> onto both sides of the equation. In short, this allows us to rewrite <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> as
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu y \right] = 5\mu.
				</me>

				<p>
					However, the question still remains: <em>Which function, <m>\mu</m>, does this?</em> Let's find out.
				</p>

		<subsection><title> The General Case </title>

			<introduction>

				<p>
					We are now ready to determine the general formula for <m>\mu</m> given any first-order linear differential equation in the standard form,
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-general-standard-form">
					\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x).
				</men>

				<p>
					Again, we seek a function, <m>\mu</m>, that we multiply onto this equation to transform it into
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-combined-form">
					\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right] = \mu Q(x).
				</men>

			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> Deriving the Integrating Factor </title>

				<p>
					As with the motivating example, we start by multiplying both sides of the differential equation by an unknown function <m>\mu</m>:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-mu-standard-form">
					\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y = \mu Q(x).
				</men>

				<p>
					The left side can only turn into <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right]</m>, if it is also equal to the expanded form of this derivative. In particular, we need:
				</p>

				<me>
					\ob{
						\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\mu P(x)}}\ y
					}^{\large\text{left-side of }<xref ref="if-mu-standard-form"/>} = 
					\ob{
						\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\frac{d\mu}{dx}}}\ y
					}^{\large\text{expanded }\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right]} 
				</me>.

				<p>
					As you can see, the two sides are identical, expect for the flagged 🚩 expressions. So, to rewrite the left side of <xref ref="if-mu-standard-form"/> as the combined derivative, <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right]</m>, the <m>\mu</m> that works must also satisfy
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn">
					\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu P(x).
				</men>

				<p>
					Therefore, <m>\mu</m>, is a solution to <xref ref="if-sov-eqn"/>, which we can solve using separation of variables, as follows:
				</p>

			<conclusion>
			
				<p>
					In this section, we derived the general formula for the integrating factor and demonstrated how to compute it with a few examples. The key takeaway is that the integrating factor always takes the form

				The integrating factor method is a versatile tool for solving first-order linear differential equations. By reducing the equation to a form that allows for direct integration, we can tackle a wide variety of problems with confidence. The examples in this chapter illustrate the broad applicability of this technique, and practice with a range of equations will solidify your understanding of how to use it effectively.
