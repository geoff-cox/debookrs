<chapter><title> Integrating Factor </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
		</p>

		<p>
			To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
		</men>

		<p>
			The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="di-eqn">
			\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
		</men>

		<p>
			Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			While the idea behind this method is simple to state, understanding how it works can be challenging. To help with this, we will draw an analogy from the algebraic technique knonw as <q>completing the square</q>. From there, we will gradually build the tools needed to transform any first-order linear equation into the solvable form given in <xref ref="di-eqn"/>.

	<section><title> Completing the Derivative &amp; The Integrating Factor </title>	
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The integrating factor method is a systematic process that converts a first-order linear differential equation into a direct integration problem. In terms of equation, it looks like
				<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative-eqn">
					\ub{\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x)}_{\text{Given Equation}} \quad 
					\os{\text{Integrating}}{\us{\text{Factor Method}}{\longrightarrow}} \quad 
					\ub{\frac{d}{dx}[ \mu(x) y ] = \mu(x) Q(x)}_{\text{Completed Derivative Equation}}
				</men>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The method gets its name from the function <m>\mu(x)</m> that must be included to get the <q>completed derivative equation</q> in <xref ref="if-completed-derivative-eqn"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of this section is to develop an intuition for the integrating factor method by first exploring the idea of <q>completing the derivative</q>. We will start by drawing a parallel to completing the square, then move on to reversing the product rule, and finally examine how to introduce the missing component—<em>the integrating factor</em>—that makes the method work.

			<p>
				Let's begin by exploring the completing the square analogy and how it relates to the integrating factor method.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> Reversed Product Rule </title>
			<p>
				At the heart of the integrating factor method lies the product rule, which states that if <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are two differentiable functions, then
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-product-rule">
				\left[ f(x) g(x) \right]^{\prime} = f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x).
			</men>

			<p>
				Most calculus problems apply the product rule in the <em>forward direction</em>: given <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>, compute their derivative. However, the integrating factor method requires us to work <em>in reverse</em>: given an expression that resembles the result of a product rule, attempt to undo it. For example, if
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-reverse-product-rule-before">
				\sin x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \cos x \cdot \ln x
			</men>,

			<p>
				then we want the product rule it came from. In this case, we want to rewrite it as
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-reverse-product-rule-after">
				\big[ \sin x \cdot \ln x \big]'
			</men>.

			<p>
				To build confidence in reversing the product rule, let's practice a few examples.
			</p>

			<example><title> Forward Product Rule </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Compute each of the derivatives below.
						</p>
						<me>
							1. \quad \left[x^6 e^{3x}\right]' \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^3} y(x)\right]
						</me>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the product rule:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds
										\left( x^6 e^{3x} \right)' =
										x^6 \cdot 3e^{3x} + 6x^5 e^{3x}
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}
										\left( e^{x^3} y(x) \right) =
										e^{x^3} y'(x) + 3x^2 e^{x^3} y(x)
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</solution>

			</example>

			<p>
				Now, let's reverse this process.
			</p>

			<example><title> Reversed Product Rule </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) g(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{x}\cos x + e^{x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln(x) e^{x^2}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>

							<p>
								One approach is to use trail-and-error to label <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, then check that the rest of the product rule is valid.
							</p>

							<p>
								First, try labeling <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as follows
								<md>
									<mrow>	
											e^x
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\cos x}}}\
											+
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}
											\sin x
											\amp = \big[
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\cos x}}}\
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}
											\big]'
									</mrow>,
								</md>
								but this doesn't work since <m>[\cos x\ e^x]' = \cos x\ e^x + (-\sin x)\ e^x</m>.
							</p>

							<p>
								Next, try the labels
								<md>
									<mrow>	
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}
											\cos x +
											e^x
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\sin x}}}\
											\amp = \big[
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}\
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\sin x}}}
											\big]'
									</mrow>.
								</md>
								A quick check of <m>[e^x \sin x]' = e^x\cos x + e^x \sin x</m>, confirms this works.
							</p>

						</solution>

						<solution>

							<p>
								The labels are easier to determine if we first rewrite the expression
								<me>
									\frac{1}{x} e^{x^2} + \ln(x) (2 x e^{x^2})
								</me>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								So, as before, we first set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
								<md>
									<mrow>	
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\text{verify } g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}\frac{1}{x}}}}
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}e^{x^2}}}} +
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln(x)}}}\
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\text{verify } f'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}(2 x e^{x^2})}}}
										\amp = \big[
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}e^{x^2}}}} \
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11}\ln(x)}}}
										\big]'
									</mrow>
								</md>
								then verify the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
								<me>
									f: \quad [e^{x^2}]' = 2 x e^{x^2} \qquad g:\quad [\ln(x)]' = \frac{1}{x}
								</me>
								we see that <m>[e^{x^2} \ln(x)]'</m> works.
							</p>
						</solution>
					</p>
				</solution>
				
			</example>

			<p>
				Here is an example that includes a variable in the expression. This is more like what you will see in a the integrating factor method.
			</p>

			<example><title> Reversed Product Rule with a Variable </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) y(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{x^2}\frac{dy}{dx} + 2 xy e^{x^2} \hspace{5em} 2. \quad e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>
							<p>
								The fact that we see <m>dy/dx</m> in the first term makes the labeling even easier since <m>f</m> must be <m>e^{x^2}</m> and <m>g</m> must be <m>y</m>. Confirming that the derivative of this <m>f</m> is <m>2xe^{x^2}</m> justifies the following reversed product rule
								<md>
									<mrow>	
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^{x^2}}}}\
											\frac{dy}{dx} +
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{y}}}\
											\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\text{verified } f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{(2xe^{x^2})}}}
											=\amp\ \frac{d}{dx}\Big[

									</mrow>
								</md>	
							</p>
						</solution>

						<solution>
							<p>
								Again, seeing <m>y'</m> in the first term means <m>f</m> must be <m>e^{1/x}</m> and <m>g</m> must be <m>y</m>. So we try the labeling
								<md>
									<mrow>

												\big]' \quad \leftarrow \text{answer.}
									</mrow>
								</md>
								As a review, here are the details of the derivative of <m>f</m>:
								<me>
									f' = \left[e^{1/x}\right]' = e^{1/x}\left[\frac{1}{x}\right]^\prime = e^{1/x}\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}
								</me>.

			<p>
				Let's extend this skill to an actual differential equation.

			</example>

			<p>
				This example illustrates the power of recognizing when an equation is already in a form that allows us to reverse the product rule. However, most differential equations do not start in this form. In the next section, we discuss how to modify an equation so that it becomes a perfect derivative.
			</p>
		</subsection>

		<subsection><title> <q>Completing the Square</q> Analogy </title>
			<p>
				Solving a differential equation using the integrating factor method is similar to solving a quadratic equation by <q>completing the square</q>. In both cases, you are including some missing component to get the equation into a form that makes it easier to solve. For example, consider the equation
				<men xml:id="if-analogy-quadratic-eqn">
					x^2 + 6x = -1
				</men>.
			</p>

			<p>
				One approach to solving this equation is to move <m>-1</m> to the left side and apply the quadratic formula. However, another way is to <q>complete the square</q> by strategically adding the one number to both sides in order to make the left-hand side a perfect square. In this case, adding <m>9</m> gives:
			</p>

			<me>
				x^2 + 6x + 9 = -1 + 9
			</me>.

			<p>
				This allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-analogy-perfect-sqr-eqn">
				(x + 3)^2 = 8
			</men>,

			<p>
				which is much easier to solve (take the square root of both sides).
			</p>

			<p>
				The key idea here is that we artifically added the specific number needed to create the prefect square. This is useful since the square can be eliminated by a square root, allowing us to isolate <m>x</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The integrating factor method follows a similar approach but applied to differential equations. Instead of <q>completing the square</q>, we aim to <q>complete the derivative</q> and use an integral to eliminate the derivative, allowing us to isolate for <m>y</m>. For example, the first-order linear differential equation,
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-analogy-first-order-linear-eqn">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 6y = -1
			</men>,

			<p>
				resembles a product rule derivative but is missing a key component. Our goal is to find and introduce this missing piece so that the left-hand side becomes a perfect derivative:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-analogy-di-eqn">
				\frac{d}{dx}[e^{6x} y] = -e^{6x}
			</men>.

			<p>
				This new form is immediately solvable through direct integration. The function we introduced, <m>e^{6x}</m>, is called the <term>integrating factor</term>, and its role is analogous to the <m>9</m> that we added to complete the square in the quadratic example.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just as completing the square helps solve quadratic equations by rewriting them in a more convenient form, completing the derivative helps solve first-order linear differential equations by making the left-hand side a perfect derivative. The next step is reviewing the product rule and exploring how to use it in the reverse direction.

		<introduction>
			<p>
				So far, we've applied the integrating factor method using intuition or by recognizing patterns. However, a natural question arises: <q>How do we determine the integrating factor for any first-order linear differential equation?</q> Fortunately, their is <em>a general formula</em> that can be derived using the ideas we've developed so far—namely, reversing the product rule and applying separation of variables.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this section, we will first <em>derive the formula for the integrating factor</em> in the context of a specific example, then generalize it to apply to any first-order linear differential equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				In the previous section, we saw how reversing the product rule allows us to rewrite a differential equation in a form that can be directly integrated. However, it is rare to encounter a differential equation where we can directly <q>complete the derivative</q> apply the  <em>not yet a complete derivative</em>, meaning that it does not immediately match the product rule.

			<subsubsection><title> An Equation with an Incomplete Derivative/A Motivating Example </title>
				<p>
					Consider the first-order linear equation:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
				</me>.

				<p>
					The left-hand side <em>almost</em> resembles the result of the product rule, but something is missing. If we attempt to rewrite it in the form <m>\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) y]</m>, we quickly run into a problem. Labeling <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as <m>g'</m>, we see that no corresponding <m>f</m> satisfies:
				</p>

				<md>
					<mrow>	
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} ? \ }}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
						+
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2 }}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
						=\amp\ 5
					</mrow>.
				</md>
				
				<p>
					The left-hand side lacks the function <m>f</m> that satisfies both parts of the product rule. To resolve this, let's create our own <m>f</m> function by multiplying both sides by it, like so
					<md>
						<mrow>	
							\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}}}}\
							\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
							+
							\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}} }}}\
							\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
							=\amp\ 5\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}
						</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>

				<p>
					For this to be a valid product rule, the derivative of <m>f</m> must be in the <m>f'</m> position. Can you think of a function has a derivative that is <m>2</m> times itself? There is only one, and that function is <m>e^{2x}</m>, since
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} \big[ {\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}} \big] = 2{\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}}
				</me>

				<p>
					Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> gives us
				</p>

				<me>
					e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
				</me>,

				<p>
					but this is the same equation as in <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"/>, which can be written as
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
				</me>

				<p>
					and solved using direct integration.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					This example demonstrates that <em>multiplying by the right function can complete a missing derivative</em>, allowing us to solve the equation. This function is called the <em>integrating factor</em>, and in the next section, we will formally define it and derive a general formula.
				</p>

				<p>
					<term>---------------------------------------------------------</term>
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Recall from the previous section that we encountered the equation:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn">
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
				</men>

				<p>
					The left-hand side <em>almost</em> resembles the result of the product rule, but it is missing a function that would allow us to rewrite it as a single derivative. To determine this function must be, we multiply the original equation by an unknown variable and see if it is possible to deduce what is must beSpecifically, we want to introduce a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu(x) y \right] = 5 \mu(x)
				</me>.

				<p>
					Our goal is to determine a general method to <em>find</em> <m>\mu(x)</m> so that this transformation always works.
				</p>

				<p>
					To achieve this, let's multiply both sides of the equation by <m>\mu(x)</m> and imagine the left-hand side as the result of the product rule <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu(x) y \right]</m>. Using the same labeling strategy as before, we have

					Now, recall that in order for this to be a valid product rule, we must have
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu^{\prime}= 2\mu \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d}{dx} [\mu] = 2\mu
				</me>,
				
				<p>
					where <m>\mu</m> is the unknown function we multiply the equation by. Notice that this is a differential equation! In particular, it is separable and we can find <m>\mu</m> with the separation of variables method, as follows
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu'(x) y.
				</me>

				<p>
					Comparing this with the left-hand side of our given equation,
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x) \cdot 2y = \mu(x) \cdot 5,
				</me>

				<p>
					we see that for these to match, <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy the equation:
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu'(x) = 2\mu(x).
				</me>

				<p>
					This is a <em>separable differential equation</em>, which we solve as follows:
				</p>

				<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
					<p>
						Separate Variables:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = 2 dx. </me>

				<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">

						Integrate Both Sides:

					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<p>
					Since <m>e^C</m> is an arbitrary constant, we can choose <m>C = 0</m> (since any constant multiple of an integrating factor still works), giving us:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="first-integrating-factor00">
					\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
				</men>

				<p>
					This function is called the <term>integrating factor</term>. It allows us to transform our equation into a perfect derivative, which can then be solved by direct integration.
				</p>
			</subsubsection>

			<subsubsection><title> The General Case </title>
				<p>
					The function <m>\mu(x) = e^{2x}</m> worked in our example because it allowed us to transform the equation into a perfect derivative. But <em>how do we find the integrating factor for any equation of the form</em>:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-standard-form00">
					y' + P(x)y = Q(x)?
				</men>

				<p>
					The same reasoning applies: multiplying both sides by some function <m>\mu(x)</m> should allow us to write the left-hand side as a product derivative:
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu(x)y' + \mu(x) P(x) y = \mu(x) Q(x).
				</me>

				<p>
					Comparing this with the product rule:
				</p>

				<me>
					\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) y' + \mu'(x) y,
				</me>

				<p>
					we conclude that <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy the equation:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-general-eqn00">
					\mu'(x) = P(x) \mu(x).
				</men>

				<p>
					This is again a separable differential equation, which we solve as follows:
				</p>

				<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
					<p>
						Separate Variables:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = P(x) dx. </me>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
					<p>
						Integrate Both Sides:
					</p>
					<p>
						<me> \int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = \int P(x) dx. </me>  
						<me> \ln|\mu| = \int P(x) dx + C. </me>

				</sidebyside>

				<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">

					</p>
					<p>
						<me> \mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx + C} = e^C e^{\int P(x) dx}. </me>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<p>
					Again, since <m>e^C</m> is an arbitrary constant, we choose <m>C = 0</m> by convention, giving us the <em>general formula for the integrating factor</em>:
				</p>

				<men xml:id="if-general-formula00">
					\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}.
				</men>
