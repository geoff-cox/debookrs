	<title> The Integrating Factor </title>	

	<introduction>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we saw how rewriting a first-order linear differential equation so that one side is a <q>completed</q> derivative helps us solve it. However, most equations do not initially have this structure. Instead, they are missing a crucial function that allows us to apply the <em>product rule in reverse</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal now is to illustrate how to determine this missing function, known as the <term>integrating factor</term>, so that we can rewrite one of the sides as a single derivative.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before moving on, let's recap these key points:

		<title> Quick Recap: Why We Need Integrating Factors </title>

		<p>
			In the last section, we explored how rewriting the left-hand side of a differential equation as a single derivative, what we called <q>completing the derivative</q>, made it easier to solve. But here's the catch: most equations aren't conveniently structured that way from the start.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, take the equation
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
		</me>

		<p>
			It's not immediately a single derivative, but it feels close. It turns out that if we multiply both sides by the right function, specifically, <m>e^{2x}</m>, we can transform the left side into:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}.
		</me>

		<p>
			Once in this form, the solution is just one integration away. The function we multiplied by, <m>e^{2x}</m>, is what we call an <term>integrating factor</term>. And the natural question is:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Where did <m>e^{2x}</m> come from?</em> Can we always find such a function? How?
		</p>

		<p>
			Just as completing the square in algebra involves adding a missing piece, completing the derivative involves multiplying a missing piece. The rest of this section is about finding that piece, systematically.
		</p>

	<paragraphs label="if-motivation-derivation">
		<title> Finding the Right Function to Multiply </title>

		<p>
			Let's go back to our earlier example:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
		</me>

		<p>
			In order to <q>complete the derivative</q>, we know we must multiply both sides by a function, but we don't know which one. Let's call this function <m>\mu(x)</m> and multiply it onto the entire equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + 2\mu(x)\,y = 5\mu(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			Now try labeling the left-hand side like we did when reversing the product rule. Let's set <m>g = y</m>, so <m>g' = dy/dx</m>, and try matching the rest:
		</p>

		<me>
			\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\mu(x)}}}\
			\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}} +
			\underset{\Large f^\prime}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{2\mu(x)}}}\
			\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
		</me>

		<p>
			The interesting part comes from the <m>f</m> and <m>f</m> labels:
		</p>

		<me>
			f = \mu(x) \quad\text{and}\quad f' = 2\mu(x)
		</me>

		<p>
			Taking the derivative of the first of these means we also have <m>f' = \mu'(x)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Setting these equal, an interesting equation emerges:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-condition-equation">
			\mu'(x) = 2\mu(x)
		</men>.

		<p>
			That's a differential equation! And it's separable, so we know how to solve it:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \frac{1}{\mu}\,d\mu \amp = \int 2\,dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \ln|\mu| \amp = 2x + c_1 </mrow>
			<mrow> \mu(x) \amp = ce^{2x} </mrow>
		</md>.

		<p>
			Any nonzero constant <m>c</m> will work, but we usually choose <m>c = 1</m> to keep things simple. So, our integrating factor is:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
		</me>

		<p>
			That's the function we needed all along. When we multiply it onto the original equation, it completes the derivative on the left-hand side for a reversed product rule.
		</p>

	<paragraphs label="if-general-formula0">
	<title> A Formula for Any Equation </title>

	<p>
		NOTE: The label matching approach works in the general case, except instead of <m>2</m>, we have <m>P(x)</m>. The separable equation that comes from setting the two versions of <m>f'</m> we get from the labels is:
		<me>
			\mu'(x) = P(x)\,\mu(x).
		</me>
		
	</p>
	<p>
		In the last example, we found the integrating factor <m>\mu(x)</m> by figuring out what function makes the left-hand side match a product rule. Let's now generalize that process to work for <em>any</em> first-order linear differential equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		We'll start with the standard form:
	</p>

	<me>
		\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)\,y = Q(x).
	</me>

	<p>
		The goal is to multiply both sides by a function <m>\mu(x)</m> so that the left side becomes the derivative of <m>\mu(x)\,y</m>. Applying the product rule to <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)\,y]</m> gives:
	</p>

	<me>
		\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu'(x)\,y.
	</me>

	<p>
		But multiplying the original equation by <m>\mu(x)</m> gives:
	</p>

	<me>
		\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)\,P(x)\,y = \mu(x)\,Q(x).
	</me>

	<p>
		To make these match, we need:
	</p>

	<me>
		\mu'(x)\,y = \mu(x)\,P(x)\,y.
	</me>

	<p>
		Again, assuming <m>y \ne 0</m>, we can cancel it out and get the condition:
	</p>

	<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn0">
		\mu'(x) = P(x)\,\mu(x).
	</men>

	<p>
		This is another separable equation. Solving it gives:
	</p>

	<md>
		<mrow> \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dx} \amp = P(x) </mrow>
		<mrow> \int \frac{1}{\mu} \, d\mu \amp = \int P(x) \, dx </mrow>
		<mrow> \ln|\mu| \amp = \int P(x)\, dx + C </mrow>
		<mrow> \mu(x) \amp = ce^{\int P(x)\, dx} </mrow>
	</md>

	<p>
		As before, any nonzero constant works, so we choose <m>c = 1</m> by convention. This gives us the formula:
	</p>

	<assemblage xml:id="integrating-factor-general-formula0">
		<title> ✳️ Integrating Factor: General Formula </title>
		<p>
		For a first-order linear equation written in the form
		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)\,y = Q(x),
		</me>
		the integrating factor is
		<me>
			\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\, dx}.
		</me>
		</p>
	</assemblage>

	<p>
		Once we have <m>\mu(x)</m>, we multiply it onto the entire equation. The left-hand side becomes <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)\,y]</m>, which we can then integrate. Let's try this out with a few examples.
	</p>

	<paragraphs label="if-formula-examples0">
	<title> Try Out the Formula </title>

	<p>
		Now that we've got the general formula
		<me>
		\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\, dx},
		</me>
		let's try using it on a few different equations to see how it works in practice. The key is to identify <m>P(x)</m>, the function in front of <m>y</m>, and plug it into the formula. The right-hand side, <m>Q(x)</m>, doesn't affect <m>\mu(x)</m> at all.

		<p>

		<me>
			\mu(x) = e^{\int \tan x\,dx} = e^{\ln |\sec x|} = \sec x.
		</me>
		</solution>

	<p>
		In each case, we followed the same process: identify <m>P(x)</m>, integrate it, and raise <m>e</m> to that power. No matter what <m>P(x)</m> is, constant, rational, trig, the same strategy works.

		<paragraphs><title> Deriving the Formula </title>

			<p>
				As with the motivating example, we start by multiplying both sides of the differential equation by an unknown function <m>\mu</m>:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-mu-standard-form">
				\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y = \mu Q(x).
			</men>

			<p>
				The left side can only turn into <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right]</m>, if it is also equal to this derivative's expanded product rule form. In particular, we need the following to be true:
			</p>

			<me>
				\ob{
					\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\mu P(x)}}\ y
				}^{\large\text{left-side of }<xref ref="if-mu-standard-form"/>} =

					\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\frac{d\mu}{dx}}}\ y
				}^{\large\text{expanded }\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu y \right]} 
			</me>.

			<p>
				As you can see, the two sides are identical, except for the flagged 🚩 expressions. This means, <xref ref="if-mu-standard-form"/> can only be written as <xref ref="if-combined-form"/> if <m>\mu</m> also satisfies

						<choice correct="yes">
							<statement>
								<p>
									The left-hand side becomes a single derivative of a product.
								</p>
							</statement>
							<feedback>

						</choice>
						<choice>
							<statement>
								<p>
									The equation transforms into a homogeneous equation.

				<task label="chkpt-general-integrating-factor-2"><title> <em>Standard Form Requirement</em> </title>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Why must a first-order linear differential equation be written in the form <m>y' + P(x)y = Q(x)</m> before using the integrating factor formula?
						</p>
					</statement>
					<choices>
						<choice correct="yes">
							<statement>
								<p>
									Because the formula was derived assuming this form.
								</p>
							</statement>
							<feedback>
								<p>
									Correct! The integrating factor formula is based on the standard form of a first-order linear equation and to compute it, <m>P(x)</m> is needed.
								</p>
							</feedback>
						</choice>
						<choice>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Because it ensures that the equation is linear.
								</p>
							</statement>
							<feedback>
								<p>
									No. You can ensure linearity without writing the equation in this form.
								</p>
							</feedback>
						</choice>
						<choice>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Because it guarantees the equation has a unique solution.
								</p>
							</statement>
							<feedback>
								<p>
									Incorrect. Writing the equation in this form does not determine uniqueness.
								</p>
							</feedback>
						</choice>
						<choice>
							<statement>
								<p>
									Because this is the standard form.
								</p>
							</statement>

					<choices>
						<choice>
							<statement>
								<p>
									A particular solution to the differential equation.
								</p>
