			In the previous section, we saw that rewriting a first-order linear differential equation so that one side is a <q>completed</q> derivative allows us to solve it using direct integration. However, many equations do not initially have this form. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The key to overcoming this issue is finding a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that, when multiplied onto the equation, allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as the derivative of a product. That is, given the standard form:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-standard-form000">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x),
		</men>

		<p>
			we seek a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that multiplying through by <m>\mu(x)</m> transforms it into:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative">
			\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			This section focuses on determining the appropriate function <m>\mu(x)</m> for any given first-order linear differential equation. We will begin with a motivating example, illustrating how to systematically determine the integrating factor. From there, we will derive a general formula that works for all equations in standard form.

			Before moving on, make sure the following points are clear:
		</p>

		<p>
			<line> 1️⃣ A derivative can be <q>completed</q> in <em>ANY</em> first order linear equation.</line>
			<line> 2️⃣ The equation must be multiplied by a function to complete the derivative.</line>
			<line> 3️⃣ The completed derivative is formed as a reverse product rule.</line>
		</p>

		<p>
			These ideas make up the fundamental strategy behind the integrating factor method. In fact, you have already seen examples of this strategy in action. What you haven't seen, however, is how to find the function that completes the derivative for any given first order linear equation. So the next step is to come up with a formula for finding it.

	<subsection><title> A Motivating Example </title>
		
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we saw that certain first-order linear differential equations can be rewritten so that the left-hand side is a single derivative. However, most equations do not initially have this structure. Instead, they are missing a crucial function that allows us to apply the <em>product rule in reverse</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of this subsection is to illustrate how to <em>determine the missing function</em> that completes the derivative. To do this, we will work through an example where we systematically construct the function needed to rewrite the equation in a solvable form.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
			</men>

			<p>
				We suspect that multiplying by some function <m>\mu(x)</m> will allow us to rewrite the left-hand side as a product derivative. That is, we seek <m>\mu(x)</m> such that:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu(x) y \right] = 5\mu(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				The key question is: <em>How do we determine</em> <m>\mu(x)</m>?

			<me>
				e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x},

			<p>
				Once in this form, the general solution is found by simple direct integration.

			<p>
				This example illustrates the strategy of finding the integrating factor for a specific equation. In the next subsection, we will generalize this process to find a formula for <m>\mu(x)</m> that works for any first-order linear differential equation.

	<subsection><title> The General Case </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous subsection, we worked through a specific example to find the function <m>\mu(x)</m> that allows us to rewrite a differential equation in a solvable form. Now, we generalize this process to determine the integrating factor for any first-order linear equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given a first-order linear differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x),
			</me>

			<p>
				our goal is to determine a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that multiplying through by <m>\mu(x)</m> transforms the equation into:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \big[ \mu(x) y \big] = \mu(x) Q(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				This will allow us to solve for <m>y</m> using direct integration.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<p>
			To determine <m>\mu(x)</m>, we start by multiplying both sides of the equation by an unknown function <m>\mu</m>:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y = \mu Q(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			For now, let's focus on the left side of this equation only by answering the question:
		</p>

		<me>
			\text{What must be true for}\quad \mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y\quad \text{to be equal to}\quad \frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu(x) y \right]
		</me>?

		<p>
			To answer this, we expand <m>\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu(x) y \right]</m> using the product rule and compare the two expressions, like so:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\mu P(x)}}\ y = \mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\frac{d\mu}{dx}}}\ y
		</me>.

		<p>
			As you can see, the two sides of the equation are identical, expect for the flagged 🚩 expressions. For this equation to be valid, these expressions must also be equal. So the answer to the question, above, is the requirement 
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn">
			\frac{d\mu}{dx} = \mu P(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			Since we only need one function to complete the derivative, we drop the absolute value and any arbitrary constant. The final formula for the integrating factor is:
		</p>

		<p>
			Just as with our motivating example, this <term>separable differential equation</term> can be <em>partially</em> solved by separation of variables as follows:
		</p>

		<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
			<p>
				Separate Variables:
			</p>
			<p>
				<me>
					\frac{1}{\mu}\ d\mu = P(x)\ dx
				</me>

		<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">

					<mrow>	\ln|\mu|					\amp = \int P(x) dx		</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
		</sidebyside>

		<aside>
			<p>
				<term>📌 Note.</term> The absolute value is dropped since the sign of the integrating factor is taken to be positive by convention.

				</me>.

				The <term>integrating factor</term> for a first-order linear differential equation in standard form

			</p>
		
			<solution>
				<p>
					The equation is in standard form with <m>P(x) = 4</m>. Using the formula:

				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int 4 dx} = e^{4x}
