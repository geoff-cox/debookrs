				Ask editor to review this section as a whole and see if it would be better to go from general to specific or vice versa.

		<p>
			In the previous section, we saw that rewriting a first-order linear differential equation so that one side is a <q>completed</q> derivative allows us to solve it using direct integration. However, many equations do not initially have this form. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The key to overcoming this issue is finding a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that, when multiplied onto the equation, allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as the derivative of a product. That is, given the standard form:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-standard-form000">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x),
		</men>

		<p>
			we seek a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that multiplying through by <m>\mu(x)</m> transforms it into:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative">
			\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			This section focuses on determining the appropriate function <m>\mu(x)</m> for any given first-order linear differential equation. We will begin with a motivating example, illustrating how to systematically determine the integrating factor. From there, we will derive a general formula that works for all equations in standard form.
		</p>

		<p>
			By the end of this section, you will be able to:

		</p>

		<p>
			Before moving on, make sure the following points are clear:
		</p>

		<p>
			<line> 1️⃣ A derivative can be <q>completed</q> in <em>ANY</em> first order linear equation.</line>
			<line> 2️⃣ The equation must be multiplied by a function to complete the derivative.</line>
			<line> 3️⃣ The completed derivative is formed as a reverse product rule.</line>
		</p>

		<p>
			These ideas make up the fundamental strategy behind the integrating factor method. In fact, you have already seen examples of this strategy in action. What you haven't seen, however, is how to find the function that completes the derivative for any given first order linear equation. So the next step is to come up with a formula for finding it.
		</p>

	<subsection><title> A Motivating Example </title>
		
		<p>
			Recall from the previous section that we encountered the equation:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
		</men>.

		<p>
			Even though we have already seen which function completes the derivative, assume it is unknown and it call <m>\mu</m>. Our goal is to find <m>\mu</m> as a function of <m>x</m> such that <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> can be rewritten as
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu(x) y \right] = 5\mu
		</me>

		<p>
			The strategy for determining <m>\mu(x)</m> is visualized in the following diagram

			The steps in <xref ref="if-strategy-1"/> are broken down, in order, as follows:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<sidebyside widths="2% 6% 92%">
				<p/>
				<p>
					1️⃣
				</p>
				<p>

				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<sidebyside widths="2% 6% 92%">
				<p/>
				<p>
					3️⃣
				</p>
				<p>
					In order for <xref ref="starting-equation"/> and <xref ref="goal-equation"/> to be equal, <xref ref="middle-equation-1"/> and <xref ref="middle-equation-2"/> must also be equal, which gives the condition equation:
					<men xml:id="condition-equation">
						\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu
					</men>.
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
		</p>

		<p>	
			This means that the function, <m>\mu</m>, we are looking for must satisfy equation <xref ref="condition-equation"/>, which can be solved by separation of variables as follows:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow>	\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu \quad \implies \quad
					\frac{1}{\mu}\ d\mu			\amp = 2 dx			</mrow>
			<mrow>	\int \frac{1}{\mu}\ d\mu	\amp = \int 2 dx	</mrow>
			<mrow>	\ln|\mu|					\amp = 2x + c		</mrow>
			<mrow>	\mu(x)						\amp = ce^{2x}		</mrow>
		</md>
		
		<p>
			Since we only need one function to reverse the product rule, any non-zero choice for <m>c</m> will work. However, the convention is to always chose <m>c=1</m>. Therefore, the integrating factor for equation <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> is <m>\mu(x) = e^{2x}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			To summarize, if we are given the equation
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5,
		</me>

		<p>
			we can multiply both sides by <m>e^{2x}</m> to get
		</p>

		<me>
			e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x},
		</me>

		<p>
			which can be rewritten as
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x},
		</me>

		<p>
			and solved by direct integration.

	<subsection><title> A Motivating Example (NEW) </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we saw that certain first-order linear differential equations can be rewritten so that the left-hand side is a single derivative. However, most equations do not initially have this structure. Instead, they are missing a crucial function that allows us to apply the <em>product rule in reverse</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				The goal of this subsection is to illustrate how to <em>determine the missing function</em> that completes the derivative. To do this, we will work through an example where we systematically construct the function needed to rewrite the equation in a solvable form.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn00">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
			</men>

			<p>
				We suspect that multiplying by some function <m>\mu(x)</m> will allow us to rewrite the left-hand side as a product derivative. That is, we seek <m>\mu(x)</m> such that:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu(x) y \right] = 5\mu(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				The key question is: <em>How do we determine</em> <m>\mu(x)</m>?
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title>Step-by-Step Breakdown</title>
			<p>
				To systematically determine <m>\mu(x)</m>, we analyze how it must interact with the given equation. The process is visualized below:
			</p>

			<!-- Placeholder for diagram -->
			<figure xml:id="if-strategy-100">
				<caption>A visual illustration of how to find <m>\mu(x)</m> given that we want to rewrite the <em>Starting Equation</em> <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> as the <em>Goal Equation</em>.</caption>
				<p>[Diagram remains unchanged]</p>
			</figure>

			<p>
				The key steps in this process are:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><term>Multiply by</term> <m>\mu(x)</m> to prepare the equation for rewriting as a derivative.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><term>Use the product rule</term> to recognize the left-hand side as a complete derivative.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><term>Solve for</term> <m>\mu(x)</m> using a simple differential equation.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Let's break down these steps in more detail.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>Solving for <m>\mu(x)</m></title>
			<p>
				From our analysis, we arrive at the condition:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="condition-equation00">
				\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu.
			</men>

			<p>
				This is a <term>separable differential equation</term>, which we can solve to find:
			</p>

			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				This confirms that multiplying both sides of the original equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				This final equation is in a form that can be solved using <term>direct integration</term>.
			</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>Key Takeaways</title>
			<p>
				This example illustrates the <term>core strategy</term> of the integrating factor method:
			</p>

			<objectives>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Multiplying by an appropriate function <m>\mu(x)</m> can transform a differential equation into a form where the left-hand side is a single derivative.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The function <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy a simple differential equation that can always be solved using separation of variables.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Once the equation is rewritten in completed derivative form, it can be solved using <em>direct integration</em>.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</objectives>

			<p>
				In the next subsection, we will generalize this process to find a formula for <m>\mu(x)</m> that works for any first-order linear differential equation.
			</p>
		</subsubsection>
	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> The General Case </title>

		<p>
			The claim is that if you multiply any first order linear differential equation,			
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
		</me>.
		
		<p>
			by some function <m>\mu(x)</m>, you complete the derivative on the left side as
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> {\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y} \amp = \mu Q(x) </mrow>
			<mrow> \downarrow \qquad\amp </mrow>
			<mrow> {\frac{d}{dx} \left[ \mu(x) y \right]} \amp = \mu Q(x) </mrow>
		</md>.

		<p>
			The question is, <em><q>What must be true for the left sides of the equations to be equal?</q></em>
		</p>

		<p>
			To answer this, set them equal to each other, like so
		</p>

		<me>
			\left[ \mu y \right]^{\prime} = \mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu P(x) y
		</me>.

		<p>
			Then, we expand the derivative on the left using the product rule and mark the differences on oppposite sides of the equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\mu^{\prime}}}\ y = \mu \frac{dy}{dx} + \us{\Large 🚩}{\ul{\mu P(x)}}\ y
		</me>.

		<p>
			As you can see, the two sides of the equation are identical, expect for the flagged 🚩 expressions. For this equation to be valid, these expressions must also be equal. So the answer to the question, above, is the requirement 
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn">
			\mu^{\prime} = \mu P(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			Just as with our motivating example, this is a differential equation that can be <em>partially</em> solved by separation of variables as follows:

	<subsection><title> The General Case (NEW) </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In the previous subsection, we worked through a specific example to find the function <m>\mu(x)</m> that allows us to rewrite a differential equation in a solvable form. Now, we generalize this process to determine the integrating factor for any first-order linear equation.
			</p>

			<p>
				Given a first-order linear differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x),
			</me>

			<p>
				our goal is to determine a function <m>\mu(x)</m> such that multiplying through by <m>\mu(x)</m> transforms the equation into:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \big[ \mu(x) y \big] = \mu(x) Q(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				This will allow us to solve for <m>y</m> using direct integration.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<p>
			To determine <m>\mu(x)</m>, we start by multiplying both sides of the equation by an unknown function <m>\mu(x)</m>:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x) P(x) y = \mu(x) Q(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			For the left-hand side to be a single derivative, <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn00">
			\frac{d}{dx} \big[ \mu(x) y \big] = \mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{d\mu}{dx} y.
		</men>

		<p>
			Comparing this with our transformed equation, we see that the two sides will match if:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d\mu}{dx} = P(x) \mu.
		</me>

		<p>
			This is a <term>separable differential equation</term>, which we solve using integration:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{1}{\mu} d\mu = P(x) dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \int \frac{1}{\mu} d\mu = \int P(x) dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \ln |\mu| = \int P(x) dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx} </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			Since we only need one function to complete the derivative, we drop the absolute value and any arbitrary constant. The final formula for the integrating factor is:
		</p>

		<assemblage xml:id="integrating-factor00"><title> Integrating Factor </title>
			<p>
				The <term>integrating factor</term> for a first-order linear differential equation in standard form
				<me>

				</me>
				is given by:
				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx}.
				</me>
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Now that we have a formula for the integrating factor, let's apply it to an example.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="integrating-factor-basic-example"><title> Basic Integrating Factor </title>

					</me>
				</statement>
			</p>
		
			<solution>
				<p>
					The equation is in standard form with <m>P(x) = 4</m>. Using the formula:
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int 4 dx} = e^{4x}

				</me>

				<p>
					Evaluating the integral:
				</p>

				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{2 \ln x} = x^2.

				</p>

				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int \tan x dx}.

				<p>
					Evaluating the integral:
