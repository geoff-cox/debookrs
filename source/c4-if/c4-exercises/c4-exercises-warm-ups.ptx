	<exercise><title> Reversed Product Rule in a Differential Equation </title>

		<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
					Rewrite the left-side of the differential equation
					<me>
						e^{\sin x} \frac{dy}{dx} + \cos x\ e^{\sin x} y = 0
					</me>
					as a reversed product rule. Then find the general solution of the equation by <xref ref="direct-integration" text="custom">direct integration</xref>.
				</p>
			</statement>
		</p>

		<p>
			<solution>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>
							To reverse the product rule on the left-side, let's label <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as before. This time, we get
						</p>

						<p>
							<md>
								<mrow>	
									\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^{\sin x}}}}\
									\frac{dy}{dx} +
									\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{y}}}\
									\cos x
									=\amp\ \big[
									\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^{\sin x}}}}\
									\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{y}}}
									\big]'
								</mrow>
							</md>
							which allows us to update the left-side of the equation as
							<me>
								\frac{d}{dx}\big[e^{\sin x} \cdot y \big]' = 0
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							To solve the differential equation, we can directly integrate both sides of the equation with respect to <m>x</m>. This gives us
							<me>
								\int e^{\sin x} \, dx = c
							</me>
							and then divide by <m>e^{\sin x}</m> to isolate <m>y</m>:
							<me>
								y = c e^{-\sin x}
							</me>.
						</p>
					</li>

		<statement>
			<p>
				Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation
				<me>
					y' = y^2 + x.
				</me>
			</p>
		</statement>

		<solution>
			<p>
				As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.
				<aside>
					<p>
						The <m>y^2</m> term makes the DE nonlinear.
					</p>
				</aside>
				This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> terms cannot be separated by multiplication.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.

	<exercise>

		<p>
			Suppose some product rule produced the following derivative
	
			<men xml:id="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq">
				2e^{2x} \cdot \sin x + e^{2x}\cdot \cos x.
			</men>

			Write down the product rule that this came from. That is, rewrite it in the form
			<me>[f \cdot g]^{\prime}.</me>
			
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				Our goal is to find <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> so that the <xref ref="review-product-rule" text="custom"> product rule </xref> gives us <xref ref="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/>. This requires that we match the terms of <m>f' \cdot g + f \cdot g'</m> and <xref ref="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Observing that <m>[e^{2x}]^{\prime} = 2e^{2x}</m>, and <m>[\sin x]^{\prime} = \cos x,</m> then it makes sense to match the terms like so
				<me>
					\underset{f^{'}}{\underline{2e^{2x}}} \cdot \underset{g}{\underline{\sin x}} + \underset{f}{\underline{e^{2x}}} \cdot \underset{g^\prime}{\underline{\cos x}}.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, we can rewrite <xref ref="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-01-eq"/> like so
				<me>
					2e^{2x} \cdot \sin x + e^{2x}\cdot \cos x = [e^{2x} \cdot \sin x]^{\prime},
				</me>
				and we have "reversed the product rule".
			</p>

		</solution>

	</exercise>

	<exercise>

		<p>
			Suppose the following expression is the derivative of a product of two functions, where <m>z</m> is a function of <m>t</m>:
			<me>6ze^{6t} + e^{6t} z'</me>
			Find the two functions and write down the derivative of their product, explicitly showing the steps involving the product rule.
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We are still trying to identify two functions, <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We may need to rearrange a little bit, but we do in fact have such functions, as shown below.
				<me>
					\us{\large f'}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{6e^{6t}}}} 	\cdot \us{\large g}{\us{\uparrow}{z}}
						+ \us{\large f}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{6t}}}}	\cdot \us{\large g'}{\us{\uparrow}{z'}}
				</me>
				Hence, <m>f=e^{6t}</m> and <m>g=z</m> and the derivative, using the product rule, is
				<me>
					\frac{d}{dt}\Big( e^{6t}\cdot z \Big) = 6ze^{6t} + e^{6t} z'
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Warning:  You've been looking at a very special class of expressions! Not every sum of terms comes from the product rule. For exercise, we cannot un-do the product rule in the expression
				<me>x^3\cdot y' + x^2\cdot y,</me>
				because the derivative of <m>x^3</m> is not <m>x^2</m>. You should pay close attention to whether you can or cannot un-do the product rule; this can help confirm if you have or have not made a mistake in solving a DE. We'll discuss this further later.

		<p>
			Rewrite the expression
			<men xml:id="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-03-eq">
				e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + 3x^2 e^{h(x)}\cdot y
			</men>
			as a "reversed product rule" in the form
			<me>\frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{h(x)}\right].</me>
		</p>

		<solution>
			<p>
				We will approach this as before and attempt to match the appropriate terms.
			</p>

			<p>
				The <xref ref="review-product-rule" text="custom"> product rule </xref> tells us that <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{h(x)}\right]</m> is the same as
				<me>y' \cdot e^{h(x)} + y \cdot e^{h(x)} \cdot h'.</me>
				<aside>
					<p>
						We used the chain rule to compute <m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{h(x)}\right].</m>
					</p>
				</aside>
				After arranging the terms, we match <xref ref="exercise-if-product-rule-reverse-03-eq"/> with
				<me>e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + \underline{h'(x)} e^{h(x)} \cdot y.</me>
				and see that <m>h'(x)</m> can only be matched to <m>3x^2</m>. So,
				<me>h'(x) = 3x^2,</me>
				and this means that <m>h</m> is the anti-derivative of <m>3x^2</m>, or
				<me>h(x) = x^3 + C.</me>
				This shows that there are many possible answers (one for each value of <m>C</m>), but only one is required. So we pick <m>C=0</m> which makes <m>h(x) = x^3</m> and conclude that
				<me>e^{h(x)} \cdot y' + 3x^2 e^{h(x)}\cdot y = \frac{d}{dx}\left[y \cdot e^{x^3}\right].</me>

			Suppose <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. Find one function <m>z(x)</m> such that the derivative of <m>z(x)\cdot y</m> has the form
			<men xml:id="undo_prod3"> z\cdot y' + z\sec^2 x\cdot y</men>
		</p>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				It may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.
				<me>
					\ub{z}_{\scriptsize f}\cdot \ub{y'}_{\scriptsize g'} + \ub{z\sec^2 x}_{\scriptsize f'}\cdot \ub{y}_{\scriptsize g}
				</me>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function <m>z</m> such that
				<me>\frac{dz}{dx} = z\sec^2 x.</me>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.
				<md>
					<mrow>\frac{1}{z}dz			\amp = \sec^2 x dx	</mrow>
					<mrow>\int \frac{1}{z}dz	\amp = \int \sec^2 x dx	</mrow>

					<mrow> z					\amp = A e^{\tan x}	</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Since we need only one function <m>z</m>, we can choose any value we like for <m>A</m>. Here we will choose <m>A = 1</m>, and therefore the function <m>z</m> is <m>z = e^{\tan x}</m>. We can check by un-doing the product rule.

			Suppose <m>P</m> and <m>y</m> are functions of <m>x</m>. Find one function <m>z(x)</m> such that the derivative of <m>z(x)\cdot y</m> has the form
			<men xml:id="undo_prod4"> z\cdot y' + z P(x)\cdot y	</men>
		</p>

	<solution>

		<p>
			This is a generic version of the previous exercise. If we can draw a conclusion using this generic version, we might be able to use it in future exercises.
		</p>

		<p>
			As before, it may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.
			<me>
				\ub{z}_{\scriptsize f}\cdot \ub{y'}_{\scriptsize g'} + \ub{zP(x)}_{\scriptsize f'}\cdot \ub{y}_{\scriptsize g}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function <m>z</m> such that
			<me>\frac{dz}{dx} = zP(x).</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.
			<md>
				<mrow>	\frac{1}{z}dz	\amp = P(x) dx	</mrow>
				<mrow>	\int \frac{1}{z}dz	\amp = \int P(x) dx	</mrow>
				<mrow>		\ln|z|	\amp = \int P(x) dx	</mrow>
				<mrow>		|z|	\amp =e^{\int P(x) dx}	</mrow>
				<mrow>		z	\amp = \pm e^{\int P(x) dx}	</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			Since we need only one function <m>z</m>, we usually choose the positive one and therefore we write <m>z = e^{\int P(x) dx}</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			This may not look like much, but let's see if it would work for the previous exercises already did. Recall that we were trying to un-do the product rule in the expression
			<men> z\cdot y' + z\sec^2 x\cdot y	</men>
		</p>

		<p>
			In this exercise, we would identify the function <m>P(x)</m> as <m>P(x) = \sec^2 x</m>. Then the function <m>z</m> we desire would be given by
			<me>\ds z = e^{\int P(x) dx} = e^{\int \sec^2 x dx} = e^{\tan x + C} = e^{\tan x}.</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			(Notice that we chose <m>C = 0</m> because we need only one function <m>z</m>, and this is the simplest choice for <m>C</m>).
		</p>

		<p>
			So our formula does give the same function <m>z</m> we found previously. Let's practice one more.
		</p>

	<p>
		Suppose <m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m>. Find one function <m>z(x)</m> such that the derivative of <m>z(x)\cdot y</m> has the form
		<me>z\cdot y' + z\cdot\frac{1}{x}\cdot y</me>
	</p>

	<solution>
		
		<p>
			In this exercise, the <m>\ds \frac{1}{x}</m> plays the same role as <m>P(x)</m> (in the previous exercise). Thus we can find <m>z</m> in a similar way.
			<me>\ds z = e^{\int 1/x\ dx} = e^{\ln|x| + C}.</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			As in the previous exercise, we need only one function <m>z</m>, so we can simplify this expression. In this case, we can choose <m>C = 0</m>, and we can also eliminate the absolute value. This lead us to <m>z = e^{\ln x}</m>, which further simplifies to <m>z = x</m>. As in the previous exercises, we can replace <m>z</m> in the original expression and then actually un-do the product rule.
