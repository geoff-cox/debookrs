		This chapter introduces a powerful method for solving first-order linear differential equations known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em>. At its core, the method transforms a differential equation into an expression that can be solved through direct integration.
	</p>

	<p>
		To provide some intuition, consider a first-order linear differential equation:
	</p>

	<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn">
		\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
	</men>

	<p>
		The goal is to rewrite this equation so that the left-hand side appears as the derivative of a product:
	</p>

	<men xml:id="di-eqn">
		\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
	</men>

	<p>
		Here, <m>\mu(x)</m> is a function—called the <term>integrating factor</term>—that we introduce specifically to make this transformation possible. Remarkably, such a function <em>always exists</em> for any first-order linear differential equation.
	</p>

	<p>
		While the idea behind this method is simple to state, understanding how it works can be challenging. To help with this, we will draw an analogy from the algebraic technique knonw as <q>completing the square</q>. From there, we will gradually build the tools needed to transform any first-order linear equation into the solvable form given in <xref ref="di-eqn"/>.
