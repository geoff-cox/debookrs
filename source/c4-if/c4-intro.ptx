		This chapter introduces a solution method known as the <em>Integrating Factor Method</em> which can solve any first-order linear differential equation. An overly simplified description of how it works goes as follows:
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a first-order linear differential equation,
		<men xml:id="first-order-std-eqn"> 
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)
		</men>,
		convert it into a direct integration problem,
		<men xml:id="di-eqn"> 
			\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) Q(x)
		</men>,
		where you just need to find <m>\mu(x)</m>. Surprisingly, this strategy is always possible with first-order linear differential equations!

		While the goal is easy to state, the process is not straightforward and can be tricky for a beginner. Nevertheless, by the end of this chapter, you will have the skills needed to convert any first-order linear differential equation <xref ref="first-order-std-eqn"/> into the direct integration form you see in <xref ref="di-eqn"/>.
