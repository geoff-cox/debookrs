			As you will see in the discussion that follow, the integrating factor method is essentially a direct integration problem in disguise. The difference here is that you must perform an initial step to rewrite the differential equation into a form for which direct integration applies.
		</p>

		<p>
			The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The key idea is to multiply the differential equation by an integrating factor that simplifies it into a form that can be solved by direct integration. In the next sections, we will explore how this is done, step by step.
		</p>

		<p> 
			We begin our discussion with a familiar concept that lies at the heart of the integrating factor (IF) methodâ€”the product rule. Recall that the product rule helps you differentiate the product of two functions. The IF method, however, does the reverse: it <q>undoes</q> the product rule to rewrite one side of the equation as a single derivative.
		</p>

		<p>
			This reversal is central to this method and can be challenging to grasp in the context of solving differential equations. In this section, we will first revisit the product rule, then practice reversing it in simple expressions, and finally, apply it in the context of differential equations.

			Unfortunately, most equations are not initially in a form where the reverse product rule can be directly applied. However, every first-order linear differential equation is just one function away from completing this form. This missing function is called the <term>integrating factor</term>, and finding it is key to solving such equations.

	<subsection><title> An Analogy </title>

		<p>
			Solving a differential equation using the integrating factor method is analogous to solving a quadratic equation by <q>completing the square</q>. In both cases, you are including some missing component to get the equation into a form that makes it easier to solve. For example, consider the equation
			<men xml:id="if-analogy-quadratic-eqn">
				x^2 + 6x = -1
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			We could solve this equation by moving <m>-1</m> to the left and applying the quadratic formula. However, another approach is to <q><xref ref="completing-the-square" text="custom">complete the square</xref></q> by adding a number to both sides of the equation that makes the left side a perfect square. For this equation, we add <m>9</m> to both sides to get
			<aside>
				<p>
					To complete the square of <me>x^2 + bx + c = 0</me>, you add and subtract <m>(\frac12b)^2</m> to get <me>x^2 + bx + (\frac12b)^2 = -c + (\frac12b)^2</me>. This simplifies to <me>(x + \frac12b)^2 = -c + (\frac12b)^2</me>.
				</p>
			</aside>
			<me>
				x^2 + 6x + 9 = -1 + 9
			</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Adding <m>9</m> <q>completes the square</q> of <m>x^2 + 6x</m>, since the equation can now be rewritten as
			<men xml:id="if-analogy-perfect-sqr-eqn">
				(x + 3)^2 = 8
			</men>
			and easily solved by taking the square root of both sides.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the case of the first-order differential equation, 
			<men xml:id="if-analogy-first-order-linear-eqn">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 6y = -1
			</men>,
			instead of <q>completing the square</q>, our goal is to <q>complete the derivative</q>. That is, we want to add something to the equation that allows us to rewrite the left side as the perfect derivative,
			<men xml:id="if-analogy-di-eqn">
				\frac{d}{dx}[e^{6x} y] = -e^{6x}
			</men>,
			which can be directly solved by integrating both sides. To summarize, here is a breakdown of the analogy:
		</p>

				Based on how <q>completing the square</q> works to solve a quadratic equation, the integrating factor method could be thought of as the completing the derivative method.

		<p>
			Comparing the integrating factor method to <q>completing the square</q> is a useful tool to help you understand the goal of this method, but we still need to figure out how to find the missing component (e.g., <m>\boxed{e^{6x}}</m>) that allows us to <q>complete the derivative</q>. Before we do this, it is helpful to review the product rule from calculus, as this is the exact the derivative we are trying to complete.

	<subsection><title> Reversed Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			Let <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> be two functions of <m>x</m>. The product rule states that
			<men xml:id="if-product-rule00">
				[f \cdot g]^{\prime} = f \cdot g^{\prime} + f^{\prime} \cdot g
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			A typical calculus problem looks something like this:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-product-rule-example">
			\big[ \sin x \cdot \ln x \big]' = \sin x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \cos x \cdot \ln x
		</men>.

		<p>
			However, to understand how the integrating factor method works, you will need to get in the mindset of the reversing this process. That is, given an expanded product rule, recombine it into a single derivative. In terms of our example, this would look like
		</p>
		
		<me>
			\ub{\sin x \cdot \frac{1}{x} + \cos x \cdot \ln x}_{\text{starting here}} = \ub{\big[ \sin x \cdot \ln x \big]'}_{\text{get here}}
		</me>.

		<p>
			To build some intuition for the reversed direction, we'll begin with examples of the product rule in its usual forward direction.
		</p>

		<example><title> Forward Product Rule </title>
			<p>
				<statement>

						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<p>
				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the <xref ref="if-product-rule" text="custom"> forward product rule </xref> and simplifying, we have

				</solution>
			</p>

		<p>
			Now that we've discussed the standard product rule, let's practice reversing it.
		</p>

		<example><title> Reversed Product Rule </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) \cdot g(x)]'</m>.
						<me>
							1. \quad e^{x}\cos x + e^{x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln(x) e^{x^2}
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					<solution>
						<p>
							We want to apply the reversed product rule. One approach is to use trail-and-error to label <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>. Then double-check that <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> are the other terms in the product rule.
						</p>

						<p>
							First, try labeling <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as follows
							<md>
								<mrow>

										\sin x
										\amp = \big[ 
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\cos x}}}\  
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}
										\big]'  \quad \leftarrow \text{doesn't work,}
								</mrow>
							</md>
							but this doesn't work since <m>[\cos x\ e^x]' = \cos x\ e^x + (-\sin x)\ e^x</m>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Next, try the labels
							<md>
								<mrow>	
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}
										\cos x + 
										e^x
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\sin x}}}\
										\amp = \big[ 
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{e^x}}}\
										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\sin x}}}
										\big]'  \quad \leftarrow \text{works.}
								</mrow>
							</md>
							A quick check of <m>[e^x \sin x]' = e^x\cos x + e^x \sin x</m>, confirms this works.
						</p>

					</solution>

					<solution>
						<p>
							The labels are easier to determine if we first rewrite the expression as

						<p>

									\amp = \big[

										\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ln(x)}}} 
									\big]'
								</mrow>
							</md>
							then verify the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
							<me>
								f: \quad [e^{x^2}]' = 2 x e^{x^2} \qquad g:\quad [\ln(x)]' = \frac{1}{x}

			Here is an example that includes a variable in the expression. This is more like what you will see in a the integrating factor method.

			This example demonstrates how reversing the product rule on one side of a differential equation opens a path to finding its solution. However, we were lucky in that the equation was already in a form where the product rule could be reversed directly. In general, first-order linear equations do not contain a complete derivative that can be reversed so easily. In the next section we show you an example where we introduce a missing piece that <q>completes the derivative</q>.

	<subsection><title> An Incomplete Derivative </title>

		<p>
			The previous examples illustrated how to solve a differential equation by combining one side as a single derivative and integrating. However, the left side was conveniently given as a perfectly expanded product rule, which is not the case for most differential equations. For a more typical example, consider the equation 
			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn"> 
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5 
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The left-hand side of the equation resembles a product rule, but it is incomplete. Labeling <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as <m>g'</m>, we see that no corresponding <m>f</m> satisfies:
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} ? \ }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2 }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5
				</mrow>.
			</md>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The left-hand side lacks the function <m>f</m> that satisfies both parts of the product rule. To resolve this, let's create our own <m>f</m> function by multiplying both sides by it, like so
			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}}}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}} }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}
				</mrow>
			</md>
		</p>

		<p>
			For this to be a valid product rule, the derivative of <m>f</m> must be in the <m>f'</m> position. Can you think of a function has a derivative that is <m>2</m> times itself? There is only one, and that function is <m>e^{2x}</m>, since
			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \big[ {\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}} \big] = 2{\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}}
			</me>
		</p>

		<p>
			Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> gives us
			<me>
				e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
			</me>,
			but this is the same equation as in <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"/>, which we already know can be rewritten as
			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
			</me>
			and solved using direct integration.
