			The integrating factor method is a systematic process that converts a first-order linear differential equation into a direct integration problem. In terms of equation, it looks like
			<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative-eqn2">
				\ub{\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x)}_{\text{Given Equation}} \quad 
				\os{\text{Integrating}}{\us{\text{Factor Method}}{\longrightarrow}} \quad 
				\ub{\frac{d}{dx}[ \mu(x) y ] = \mu(x) Q(x)}_{\text{Completed Derivative Equation}}
			</men>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The method gets its name from the function <m>\mu(x)</m> that must be included to get the <q>completed derivative equation</q> in <xref ref="if-completed-derivative-eqn1"/>.
		</p>

		<p>
			The goal of this section is to develop an intuition for the integrating factor method by first exploring the idea of <q>completing the derivative</q>. We will start by drawing a parallel to completing the square, then move on to reversing the product rule, and finally examine how to introduce the missing component—<em>the integrating factor</em>—that makes the method work.

	<subsection><title> Finding the Integrating Factor </title>

		<introduction>

			<p>
				Before we begin with the next topic, make sure the following points are clear:
			</p>

			<p>
				<line> 1️⃣ A derivative can be <q>completed</q> in <em>ANY</em> first order linear equation.</line>
				<line> 2️⃣ The equation must be multiplied by a function to complete the derivative.</line>
				<line> 3️⃣ The completed derivative is formed as a reverse product rule.</line>
			</p>

			<p>
				These ideas make up the fundamental strategy behind the integrating factor method. In fact, you have already seen examples of this strategy in action. What you haven't seen, however, is how to find the function that completes the derivative for any given first order linear equation. So the next step is to come up with a formula for finding it.
			</p>

		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title> A Motivating Example </title>
			
			<p>
				Recall from the previous section that we encountered the equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-example-incomplete-eqn">
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
			</men>.

			<p>
				Even though we have already seen which function completes the derivative, assume it is unknown and it call <m>\mu</m>. Our goal is to find <m>\mu</m> as a function of <m>x</m> such that <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> can be rewritten as
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[\mu y \right] = 5\mu
			</me>

			<p>
				The strategy for determining <m>\mu</m> is visualized in the following diagram
			</p>

			<figure xml:id="if-strategy-1">
				<caption>The following diagram gives a visual illustration of how to find <m>\mu</m> given that we want to rewrite the <em>Starting Equation</em> as the <em>Goal Equation</em>.</caption>

			</figure>

			<p>
				The steps in <xref ref="if-strategy-1"/> are broken down, in order, as follows:
			</p>
			
			<p>
				<sidebyside widths="2% 6% 92%">
					<p/>
					<p>
						1️⃣
					</p>
					<p>
						Multiply the original equation by <m>\mu</m> to get Middle Equation 1.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<sidebyside widths="2% 6% 92%">
					<p/>
					<p>
						2️⃣
					</p>
					<p>
						Use the product rule on Goal Equation's left side to get Middle Equation 2.
					</p>
				</sidebyside>

				<sidebyside widths="2% 6% 92%">
					<p/>
					<p>
						3️⃣
					</p>
					<p>
						In order for the Starting and Goal Equations to be equal, Middle Equations 1 and 2 must also be equal, which gives the Condition Equation:
						<me>
							\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu
						</me>.
						This is a separable differential equation that can be solved to find <m>\mu</m>!
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
			</p>

		
			
			<p>	
				Next, we find <m>\mu</m> by solving the Condition Equation using separation of variables.
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	\frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2\mu \quad \implies \quad
						\frac{1}{\mu}\ d\mu			\amp = 2 dx			</mrow>
				<mrow>	\int \frac{1}{\mu}\ d\mu	\amp = \int 2 dx	</mrow>
				<mrow>	\ln|\mu|					\amp = 2x + c		</mrow>
				<mrow>	\mu							\amp = ce^{2x}		</mrow>
			</md>
			
			<p>
				Since any non-zero <m>c</m> will be a solution, we chose <m>c=1</m>. Thus, the integrating factor that we multiply <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/> by to complete the product rule is
				<me>
					\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				While this integrating factor is specific to <xref ref="if-example-incomplete-eqn"/>, the general integrating factor is found in a similar manner, which we will now show.
			</p>

			<p>
				Consider the first-order linear equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5
			</me>.

			<p>
				The left-hand side <em>almost</em> resembles the result of the product rule, but something is missing. If we attempt to rewrite it in the form <m>\frac{d}{dx} [f(x) y]</m>, we quickly run into a problem. Labeling <m>y</m> as <m>g</m> and <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> as <m>g'</m>, we see that no corresponding <m>f</m> satisfies:
			</p>

			<md>
				<mrow>	
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} ? \ }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
					+
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2 }}}\
					\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
					=\amp\ 5
				</mrow>.
			</md>
			
			<p>
				The left-hand side lacks the function <m>f</m> that satisfies both parts of the product rule. To resolve this, let's create our own <m>f</m> function by multiplying both sides by it, like so
				<md>
					<mrow>	
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}}}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
						+
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large f^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} 2\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}} }}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large g}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
						=\amp\ 5\ \boxed{\phantom{\large|} \color{BurntOrange}{f} \phantom{\large|}}
					</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				For this to be a valid product rule, the derivative of <m>f</m> must be in the <m>f'</m> position. Can you think of a function has a derivative that is <m>2</m> times itself? There is only one, and that function is <m>e^{2x}</m>, since
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \big[ {\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}} \big] = 2{\color{BurntOrange}\us{\text{itself}}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{2x}}}}}
			</me>

			<p>
				Multiplying both sides of the equation by <m>e^{2x}</m> gives us
			</p>

			<me>
				e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
			</me>,

			<p>
				but this is the same equation as in <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"/>, which can be written as
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
			</me>

			<p>
				and solved using direct integration.
			</p>
				
			<p>
				This example demonstrates that <em>multiplying by the right function can complete a missing derivative</em>, allowing us to solve the equation. This function is called the <em>integrating factor</em>, and in the next section, we will formally define it and derive a general formula.

			<p>
				Now, recall that in order for this to be a valid product rule, we must have
			</p>

			<me>
				\mu^{\prime}= 2\mu \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{d}{dx} [\mu] = 2\mu
			</me>,
			
			<p>
				where <m>\mu</m> is the unknown function we multiply the equation by. Notice that this is a differential equation! In particular, it is separable and we can find <m>\mu</m> with the separation of variables method, as follows
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu'(x) y.
			</me>

			<p>
				Comparing this with the left-hand side of our given equation,
			</p>

			<me>
				\mu(x) \frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x) \cdot 2y = \mu(x) \cdot 5,
			</me>

			<p>
				we see that for these to match, <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy the equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\mu'(x) = 2\mu(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				This is a <em>separable differential equation</em>, which we solve as follows:
			</p>

			<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
				<p>
					Separate Variables:
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = 2 dx. </me>

				</p>
				<p>
					<me> \mu(x) = e^{2x + C} = e^C e^{2x}. </me>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Since <m>e^C</m> is an arbitrary constant, we can choose <m>C = 0</m> (since any constant multiple of an integrating factor still works), giving us:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="first-integrating-factor00">
				\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				This function is called the <term>integrating factor</term>. It allows us to transform our equation into a perfect derivative, which can then be solved by direct integration.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title> The General Case </title>

			<p>
				Every first-order linear differential equation has the form
				<me>
					y' + P(x)y = Q(x)
				</me>,
				and the left side is always one piece away from a complete product rule. To find this piece, we multiply both sides by <m>\mu</m>, and label the pieces of the product rule, as before,
				<md>
					<mrow>	
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} \mu }}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y'}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y'}}}
						+
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large \mu^{'}}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\ \vphantom{\frac11} P(x)\ \mu }}}\
						\underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\large y}}{ \underset{\color{BurntOrange}{\uparrow}}{\ul{\vphantom{\frac11} y\ }}}
						=\amp\ Q(x)\ \mu
					</mrow>.
				</md>
				We reason that in order for this to be a valid product rule, we must have
				<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn">
					\mu^{\prime} = P(x)\ \mu
				</men>.
				which is a differential equation that can be solved by separation of variables to find the integrating factor, <m>\mu</m>, as
				<men xml:id="def-integrating-factor">
					\mu = e\vphantom{\large|}^{\textstyle\int P(x)\ dx}
				</men>.
			</p>

			<theorem xml:id="integrating-factor"><title>Solution to Equation <xref ref="if-sov-eqn"/></title>

				<statement>

					<p>

			</theorem>

			<p>
				The function <m>\mu(x) = e^{2x}</m> worked in our example because it allowed us to transform the equation into a perfect derivative. But <em>how do we find the integrating factor for any equation of the form</em>:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-standard-form00">
				y' + P(x)y = Q(x)?
			</men>

			<p>
				The same reasoning applies: multiplying both sides by some function <m>\mu(x)</m> should allow us to write the left-hand side as a product derivative:
			</p>

			<me>
				\mu(x)y' + \mu(x) P(x) y = \mu(x) Q(x).
			</me>

			<p>
				Comparing this with the product rule:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{d}{dx} [\mu(x) y] = \mu(x) y' + \mu'(x) y,
			</me>

			<p>
				we conclude that <m>\mu(x)</m> must satisfy the equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-general-eqn00">
				\mu'(x) = P(x) \mu(x).
			</men>

			<p>
				This is again a separable differential equation, which we solve as follows:
			</p>

			<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">
				<p>
					Separate Variables:
				</p>
				<p>
					<me> \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = P(x) dx. </me>

			<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">

					<me> \int \frac{d\mu}{\mu} = \int P(x) dx. </me>  
					<me> \ln|\mu| = \int P(x) dx + C. </me>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<sidebyside widths="30% 70%" valigns="top middle">

				<p>
					<me> \mu(x) = e^{\int P(x) dx + C} = e^C e^{\int P(x) dx}. </me>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Again, since <m>e^C</m> is an arbitrary constant, we choose <m>C = 0</m> by convention, giving us the <em>general formula for the integrating factor</em>:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-general-formula00">
