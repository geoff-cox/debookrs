	<title> The Integrating Factor </title>	

	<introduction>

		<p>
			In the last section, we explored how rewriting the left-hand side of a differential equation as a single derivative (i.e., <q>completing the product rule</q>) made it easier to solve. But here's the catch: most equations aren't initially set-up for this.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, take the equation
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
		</me>

		<p>
			As it is, it's not a complete product rule, but it can be if we multiply both sides by <m>e^{2x}</m>:
		</p>

		<me>
			e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y = 5e^{2x}
		</me>.

		<p>
			Now, we can reverse product rule on the left, giving us
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ e^{2x} y \right] = 5e^{2x}
		</me>,

		<p>
			which is just one integration away from the solution. The function, <m>e^{2x}</m>, that we multiplied onto the equation is known as the <term>integrating factor</term>. And the natural question is:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>Where did <m>e^{2x}</m> come from?</em> Can we always find such a function? How?
		</p>

		<p>
			This section answers these questions and prepares you for next solution technique, the <term>integrating factor method</term>.

		<title> Finding the Right Function to Multiply </title>

		<p>
			To see where <m>e^{2x}</m> came from, let's go back to our example:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 5.
		</me>

		<p>
			In order to <q>complete the product rule</q>, we know we must multiply both sides by a function, but we don't know which one. Let's call this function <m>\mu(x)</m> and multiply it onto the entire equation to see if we can gain some insight to what it should be:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + 2\mu(x)\,y = 5\mu(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			If this is a product rule that can be reversed, then we should be able to label the parts as we did before. Let's set <m>g = y</m>, so <m>g' = dy/dx</m>, and try matching the rest:
		</p>

		<me>
			\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\mu(x)}}}\
			\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}} +
			\underset{\Large f^\prime}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{2\mu(x)}}}\
			\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
		</me>

		<p>
			The interesting part comes from the <m>f</m> and <m>f'</m> labels:
		</p>

		<me>
			f = \mu(x) \quad\text{and}\quad f' = 2\mu(x)
		</me>

		<p>
			Taking the derivative of the first of these means we also have <m>f' = \mu'(x)</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Setting the two versions of <m>f'</m> equal, an intriguing equation emerges:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-condition-equation">
			\mu'(x) = 2\mu(x)
		</men>.

		<p>
			That's a differential equation! And it's separable, so we know how to solve it for <m>\mu</m>:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dx} = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \int \frac{1}{\mu}\,d\mu \amp = \int 2\,dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \ln|\mu| \amp = 2x + c_1 </mrow>
			<mrow> \mu(x) \amp = ce^{2x} </mrow>
		</md>.

		<p>
			We just need one <m>\mu</m>, so we usually choose <m>c = 1</m> to keep things simple, but any nonzero <m>c</m> also works. So, our integrating factor is:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x) = e^{2x}.
		</me>

		<p>
			That's the function we needed all along. It is a function that we can multiply onto the original equation to complete the product rule.

		<title> A Formula for Any Equation </title>

		<p>
			NOTE: The label matching approach works in the general case, except instead of <m>2</m>, we have <m>P(x)</m>. The separable equation that comes from setting the two versions of <m>f'</m> we get from the labels is:
			<me>
				\mu'(x) = P(x)\,\mu(x).
			</me>
			
		</p>

		<p>
			In the last example, we found the integrating factor <m>\mu(x)</m> by figuring out what function makes the left-hand side match a product rule. Let's now generalize that process to work for <em>any</em> first-order linear differential equation.
		</p>

		<p>
			We'll start with the standard form:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)\,y = Q(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			The goal is to multiply both sides by a function <m>\mu(x)</m> so that the left side becomes the derivative of <m>\mu(x)\,y</m>. Applying the product rule to <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)\,y]</m> gives:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu'(x)\,y.
		</me>

		<p>
			But multiplying the original equation by <m>\mu(x)</m> gives:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu(x)\,\frac{dy}{dx} + \mu(x)\,P(x)\,y = \mu(x)\,Q(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			To make these match, we need:
		</p>

		<me>
			\mu'(x)\,y = \mu(x)\,P(x)\,y.
		</me>

		<p>
			Again, assuming <m>y \ne 0</m>, we can cancel it out and get the condition:
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-sov-eqn0">
			\mu'(x) = P(x)\,\mu(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			This is another separable equation. Solving it gives:
		</p>

		<md>
			<mrow> \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{d\mu}{dx} \amp = P(x) </mrow>
			<mrow> \int \frac{1}{\mu} \, d\mu \amp = \int P(x) \, dx </mrow>
			<mrow> \ln|\mu| \amp = \int P(x)\, dx + C </mrow>
			<mrow> \mu(x) \amp = ce^{\int P(x)\, dx} </mrow>
		</md>

		<p>
			As before, any nonzero constant works, so we choose <m>c = 1</m> by convention. This gives us the formula:
		</p>

			<title> ✳️ Integrating Factor: General Formula </title>
			<p>
			For a first-order linear equation written in the form
			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)\,y = Q(x),
			</me>
			the integrating factor is
			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\, dx}.
			</me>
			</p>
		</assemblage>

		<p>
			Once we have <m>\mu(x)</m>, we multiply it onto the entire equation. The left-hand side becomes <m>\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)\,y]</m>, which we can then integrate. Let's try this out with a few examples.

		<title> Try Out the Formula </title>

		<p>
			Now that we've got the general formula
			<me>
			\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)\, dx},
			</me>
			let's try using it on a few different equations to see how it works in practice. The key is to identify <m>P(x)</m>, the function in front of <m>y</m>, and plug it into the formula. The right-hand side, <m>Q(x)</m>, doesn't affect <m>\mu(x)</m> at all.
		</p>

		<example>
			<title> Constant Coefficient </title>
			<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
				Find the integrating factor for
				</p>
				<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 4y = x.
				</me>
			</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
			<p>
				Here, <m>P(x) = 4</m>, so the integrating factor is:
			</p>
			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{\int 4\,dx} = e^{4x}.
			</me>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<title> Logarithmic Result </title>
			<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
				Find the integrating factor for
				</p>
				<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + \frac{2}{x}\,y = x^3.
				</me>
				<p>
				(Assume <m>x > 0</m>.)
				</p>
			</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
			<p>
				The function multiplying <m>y</m> is <m>P(x) = \frac{2}{x}</m>. Plugging into the formula:
			</p>
			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{\int \frac{2}{x}\,dx} = e^{2\ln x} = x^2.
			</me>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<example>
			<title> Trigonometric Coefficient </title>
			<p>
			<statement>
				<p>
				Find the integrating factor for
				</p>
				<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + \tan x \cdot y = \cos x.
				</me>
			</statement>
			</p>
			<solution>
			<p>
				The function multiplying <m>y</m> is <m>P(x) = \tan x</m>. Then:
			</p>
			<me>
				\mu(x) = e^{\int \tan x\,dx} = e^{\ln |\sec x|} = \sec x.
			</me>
			</solution>
		</example>

		<p>
			In each case, we followed the same process: identify <m>P(x)</m>, integrate it, and raise <m>e</m> to that power. No matter what <m>P(x)</m> is, constant, rational, trig, the same strategy works.
