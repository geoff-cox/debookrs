			The <term>integrating factor method</term> is a systematic technique that transforms a first-order linear differential equation into a form that can be solved by <em>direct integration</em>. At its core, the method works by rewriting one side of the equation as the <q>derivative of a product</q>. Specifically, given the standard form of a first-order linear equation,

		<men xml:id="if-standard-form00">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x) y = Q(x)
		</men>

		<p>
			the goal is to introduce a function <m>\mu(x)</m>, called the <term>integrating factor</term>, that allows us to rewrite the equation as
		</p>

		<men xml:id="if-completed-derivative00">
			\frac{d}{dx} \big[ \mu(x) y \big] = \mu(x) Q(x).
		</men>

		<p>
			This process, which we call <q>completing the derivative</q>, is what makes the integrating factor method so powerful.

	<subsection><title> Reversing the Product Rule </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				The integrating factor method relies on rewriting a differential equation so that the left-hand side becomes the 
				<q>derivative of a product</q>. To do this, we need to recognize when an expression 
				<q>can be written as a product rule in reverse</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we will:
			</p>

			<p>
				<line>âœ… Review the product rule from calculus.</line>
				<line>âœ… Practice reversing the product rule on different expressions.</line>
				<line>âœ… Apply this idea to transform differential equations into a solvable form.</line>
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection><title>The Product Rule: A Quick Review</title>
			<p>
				The <term>product rule</term> states that if <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are differentiable functions, then:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="if-product-rule">
				\frac{d}{dx} [ f(x) g(x) ] = f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x).
			</men>

			<p>
				Most calculus problems apply the product rule <q>in the forward direction</q>â€”given <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m>, compute their derivative. However, in the integrating factor method, we must <q>work in reverse</q>.
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider the expression:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{1}{x} \sin x + \cos x \ln x.
			</me>

			<p>
				This can be rewritten as the derivative of a product:
			</p>

			<me>
				\big[\sin x \cdot \ln x \big]'.
			</me>

			<p>
				To get in the mindset of reversing the product rule, let's warm up with a few forward product rule problems.
			</p>

			<example><title> Forward Product Rule </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Compute each of the derivatives below.
						</p>
						<me>
							1. \quad \left[x^6 e^{3x}\right]' \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^3} y(x)\right]
						</me>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Using the product rule:
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds
										\left( x^6 e^{3x} \right)' =
										x^6 \cdot 3e^{3x} + 6x^5 e^{3x}
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									<m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}
										\left( e^{x^3} y(x) \right) =
										e^{x^3} y'(x) + 3x^2 e^{x^3} y(x)
									</m>
								</p>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				</solution>

			</example>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>Recognizing and Reversing the Product Rule</title>

			<p>
				Now, let's try reversing the product rule in the next few examples.
			</p>

			<example><title> Basic Reverse Product Rule </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) g(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{x}\cos x + e^{x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2}
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>

							<p>
								One approach is to guess <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> on different terms, then check that the corresponding <m>f'</m> and <m>g'</m> are in the other terms.
							</p>

							<p>
								First, try guessing <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> as follows
							</p>

							<p>
								<me>
									e^x\
									\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\cos x}}}
									+
									\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
									\sin x
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								To be a valid product rule, <m>f'</m> needs to be <m>\sin x</m>, but our choice of <m>f</m> results in <m>f' = [\cos x]' = -\sin x</m>, so this guess doesn't work.
							</p>

							<p>
								Next, try the labels
							</p>

							<p>
								<me>
									\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
									\cos x
									+
									e^x\
									\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\sin x}}}
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								Noting that <m>f' = [e^x]' = e^x</m> is the other part of the second term and <m>g' = [\sin x]' = \cos x</m> is in the first term confirms this is a valid product rule. Therefore, we can reverse the product rule as
							</p>

							<me>
								e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x = [e^x \cos x]'
							</me>.


						</solution>

						<solution>

							<p>
								To make this easier, let's separate the terms as
								<me>
									\frac{1}{x} e^{x^2} + \ln x (2 x e^{x^2})
								</me>.
							</p>
							
							<p>
								So, as before, we first set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{1}{x}\
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^{x^2}}}}
								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\ln x}}}\
								2 x e^{x^2}
							</me>,

							<p>
								then verify the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are in the other terms,
							</p>

							<me>
								f' = \left[e^{x^2}\right]' = 2 x e^{x^2} \quad âœ… \qquad g' = \left[\ln x\right]' = \frac{1}{x} \quad âœ…
							</me>.

							<p>
								Therefore,
							</p>

							<me>
								\frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2} = \left[e^{x^2} \ln x\right]'
							</me>.
						</solution>
					</p>
				</solution>
				
			</example>

			<p>
				The next example involves an expression that contains a variable, making it more relevant to differential equations.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="reversed-product-rule-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule with a Variable </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) y(x)]'</m>.
							<me>
								1. \quad e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9y e^{9x} \hspace{5em} 2. \quad e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y
							</me>
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<solution>
					<p>
						<solution>
							<p>
								Observe that <m>dy/dx</m> and <m>y</m> in opposite terms gives you <m>g</m> for free and so <m>f</m> must be the function next to <m>dy/dx</m>. That is,
							</p>

							<me>
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{9x}}}}\
								\frac{dy}{dx}
								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}\
								(9 e^{9x})
							</me>.

							<p>
								Clearly, <m>g'</m> is <m>dy/dx</m> in the first term and <m>f' = [e^{9x}]' = 9e^{9x}</m> is the other part in the second term, so we can conclude
							</p>

							<me>
								e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9 e^{9x} y = \left[e^{9x} y\right]'
							</me>.

						</solution>

						<solution>
							<p>
								Again, we can set <m>g'</m> to <m>y'</m> for free, so <m>g</m> must be <m>y</m> and <m>f</m> must be <m>e^{1/x}</m>, as shown
							</p>

							<me>
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{1/x}}}}\
								y'
								+
								\left(-\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}\right)\
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
							</me>.

							<p>
								The only thing left to do is verify the derivative of <m>f</m>:
								<me>
									f' = \left[e^{1/x}\right]' = e^{1/x}\left[\frac{1}{x}\right]^\prime = e^{1/x}\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2} \quad âœ…
								</me>.
							</p>

							<p>
								So, we can reverse the product rule as
							</p>

							<me>
								e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y = \left[e^{1/x} y\right]'
							</me>.

						</solution>
					</p>
				</solution>
				
			</example>
			
			<p>
				These exercises help develop an intuition for recognizing when a sum of terms can be rewritten as the derivative of a product. While reversing the product rule is not a method you need to master, it plays a central role in the integrating factor method.
			</p>

		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection><title>Why This Matters for Differential Equations</title>

			<p>
				Some differential equations contain expressions similar to those in <xref ref="reversed-product-rule-example"/>. When this is the case, it is often beneficial to rewrite the equation as a <q>completed</q> derivative.  
			</p>

			<p>
				For example, consider the equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE">
				\ub{e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y}_{\text{looks like a product rule}} = 5e^{2x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				The left-hand side resembles the derivative of <m>e^{2x} y</m>. Using the product rule in reverse, we can rewrite it as:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE-solution">
				\frac{d}{dx} [ e^{2x} y ] = 5e^{2x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				This transformation is powerful because it allows us to solve the equation through direct integration.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule in a Differential Equation </title>

				<p>
					<statement>
						<p>
							Find the general solution of the equation
							<men xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example-eqn">
								e^{x^4} \frac{dy}{dx} + 4x^3e^{x^4} y = 5x
							</men>
							by rewriting the left-side as a single derivative and then direct integration.
						</p>
					</statement>
				</p>

				<p>
					<solution>

						<p>
							To reverse the product rule on the left-side, set <m>g</m> and <m>f</m> as before
						</p>

						<me>
							\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{x^4}}}}\
							\frac{dy}{dx}
							+
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}\
							(4x^3 e^{x^4}) \quad \Big(f' = [e^{x^4}]' = 4x^3 e^{x^4} \ âœ… \Big)
						</me>

						<p>
							and so the left side can be written as the derivative <m>\ \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} y\right]</m>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Now, we update the differential equation and integrate as follows:
						</p>

						<md>
							<mrow>			\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} \cdot y \right]	\amp = 5x										</mrow>
							<mrow>	\int \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} \cdot y \right]\ dx	\amp = \int 5x \ dx								</mrow>
							<mrow>											e^{x^4} y	\amp = \frac{5}{2} x^2 + c						</mrow>
							<mrow>													y	\amp = \frac{5}{2} x^2 e^{-x^4} + c e^{-x^4}	</mrow>
						</md>.

					</solution>
				</p>

			</example>

		<conclusion>
			<p>
				Rewriting a differential equation so that one side is a <q>completed</q> derivative is a crucial step in the <em>integrating factor method</em>. The examples in this section show that when an equation already has the structure of a product rule, it can be solved easily. However, most first-order linear equations are <em>missing</em> a necessary function to complete the derivative.  
			</p>

			<p>
				In the next section, we will introduce the concept of an <em>integrating factor</em>, which allows us to <em>modify</em> a first-order linear equation so that it always fits the product rule structure.

	<subsection><title> Completing the Square Analogy </title>

		<introduction>
			<p>
				Solving a differential equation using the integrating factor method is similar to solving a quadratic equation by 
				<q>completing the square</q>. In both cases, we strategically modify the equation by introducing a missing component 
				to rewrite it in a form that is easier to solve.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this subsection, we will:
			</p>

			<p>
				<line>âœ… Review completing the square to solve quadratic equations.</line>
				<line>âœ… Compare it to completing the derivative to solve a differential equation.</line>
				<line>âœ… Motivate how the integrating factor method works through this analogy.</line>
			</p>
			
		</introduction>

		<subsubsection xml:id="quadratic-completing-square"><title>Completing the Square - Quadratic Equations</title>
			<p>
				Consider the quadratic equation:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="quadratic-example">
				x^2 + 6x = -1.
			</men>

			<p>
				One way to solve this equation is to move <m>-1</m> to the left-hand side and apply the quadratic formula. However, 
				another approach is to <q>complete the square</q> by strategically adding a missing term that turns the left-hand side into 
				a perfect square.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this case, the missing piece is <m>\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 9</m>, so we add it to both sides:
			</p>

			<me>
				x^2 + 6x + 9 = -1 + 9.
			</me>

			<p>
				Now, the left-hand side can be rewritten as a perfect square:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="perfect-square">
				(x + 3)^2 = 8.
			</men>

			<p>
				Taking the square root of both sides gives:
			</p>

			<me>
				x + 3 = \pm\sqrt{8} \quad \implies \quad x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
			</me>

			<p>
				The key idea here is that we introduced a carefully chosen term to rewrite the equation in a form that was easier to solve.
			</p>
		</subsubsection>

		<subsubsection xml:id="completing-the-derivative"><title>Completing the Derivative - Differential Equations</title>
			<p>
				The integrating factor method follows a similar idea, but instead of completing the square, we <q>complete the derivative</q>.
				To see this, consider the first-order linear differential equation:
			</p>

			<me>
				\frac{dy}{dx} + 6y = -1.
			</me>

			<p>
				We want to write the left-hand side as a single derivative, but in its current form, this is not possible. However, if we multiply both sides by <m>e^{6x}</m>, we obtain:
			</p>

			<me>
				e^{6x}\left(\frac{dy}{dx} + y\right) = -1\cdot e^{6x} \quad \implies \quad e^{6x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 6e^{6x}y = -e^{6x}.
			</me>

			<p>
				Now, the left-hand side resembles the product rule and can be rewritten as:
			</p>

			<men xml:id="completed-derivative">
				\frac{d}{dx} [e^{6x} y] = -e^{6x}.
			</men>

			<p>
				Just as completing the square introduced a missing term to make factoring possible, multiplying by the <em>integrating factor</em> <m>e^{6x}</m> introduced the missing term needed to rewrite the equation as a single derivative.
