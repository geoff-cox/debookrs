<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Completing the Derivative </title>	

	<introduction>

		<p>
			Many algebraic equations can be solved by strategically grouping or combining terms. For example, consider the quadratic equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			x^2 + 10x + 25 = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			One way to solve this equation is by factoring the left-hand side:
		</p>

		<me>
			(x + 5)^2 = 0.
		</me>

		<p>
			This way of grouping is useful because it allows us to solve for <m>x</m> directly by taking a square root.
		</p> 

		<p>
			Certain <term>first-order differential equations</term> benefit from a similar strategy. Instead of grouping algebraic terms into a square, we restructure a differential equation so that one side appears as a <em>single derivative</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the equation:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2 y = 5
		</me>

		<p>
			can be rewritten as:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} [e^{2x} y] = 5e^{2x}.
		</me>

		<p>
			This transformation is powerful because it allows us to solve for <m>y</m> using <em>direct integration</em>, just as factoring allowed us to solve for <m>x</m> in the quadratic example.
		</p>

		<p>
			For this discussion we will refer to this process as <term>completing the derivative</term>. It consists of two key steps:
		</p>

		<p>
			<line> 1️⃣ <term>Introducing a missing function</term> needed to bundle terms into a derivative.</line>
			<line> 2️⃣ <term>Applying the reverse product rule</term> to construct a combined derivative.</line>
		</p>

		<p>
			This section explores both of these crucial steps. We begin by reviewing how to recognize and reverse the product rule within a differential equation. Then, we introduce cases where an additional function is required before the derivative can be constructed.
		</p>

	</introduction>

	<subsection><title> The Product Rule: A Quick Review </title>

		<p>
			The <term>product rule</term> is a fundamental differentiation technique that describes how to differentiate a product of two functions. If <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> are differentiable, their derivative satisfies:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(x) g(x) \right] = f(x) g'(x) + f'(x) g(x).
		</me>

		<p>
			Let's warm up with a few examples to refresh our memory.
		</p>

		<example><title> Forward Product Rule </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Compute each of the derivatives below.
					</p>
					<me>
						1. \quad \left[x^6 e^{3x}\right]' \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^3} y(x)\right]
					</me>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					Using the product rule:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>\ds
									\left( x^6 e^{3x} \right)' =
									x^6 \cdot 3e^{3x} + 6x^5 e^{3x}
								</m>
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>
								<m>\ds\frac{d}{dx}
									\left( e^{x^3} y(x) \right) =
									e^{x^3} y'(x) + 3x^2 e^{x^3} y(x)
								</m>
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>

	<subsection><title> Recognizing and Reversing the Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			Normally, we apply the product rule <em>in the forward direction</em>, starting with a product and differentiating it into separate terms. However, when solving differential equations, we often need to work <em>in reverse</em>—that is, given a sum of terms, we determine whether they originate from a product rule derivative. This process is crucial in the integrating factor method, where we aim to rewrite an equation so that one side is a derivative of a product.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the expression:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{1}{x} \sin x + \cos x \ln x
		</me>

		<p>
			can be rewritten as:
		</p>

		<me>
			\left[ \sin x \cdot \ln x \right]'.
		</me>

		<p>
			The product rule expands the derivative of a product into two distinct terms:
		</p>

		<me>
			\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f \cdot g \right] = \ul{f \cdot g'} + \ul{f' \cdot g}.
		</me>

		<p>
			Recognizing when a product rule can be reversed involves:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>
					Identifying two terms that could correspond to <m>f \cdot g'</m> and <m>f' \cdot g</m>.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Choose candidate functions for <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in separate terms.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
					Using your choices, test that <m>[f \cdot g]'</m> produces the original terms.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Let's practice these steps with a few examples.
		</p>

		<example><title> Basic Reverse Product Rule (ver 1) </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) g(x)]'</m>.
						<me>
							1. \quad e^{x}\cos x + e^{x}\sin x \hspace{5em} 2. \quad \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2}
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					<solution>

						<p>
							First, select an <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> in different terms, like so
						</p>

						<p>
							<me>
								e^x\
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\cos x}}}
								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
								\sin x
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p>
							For this to work, <m>f'</m> should be <m>\sin x</m>, next to our choosen <m>g</m>. However,
							<me>
								f' = [\cos x]' = -\sin x
							</me>
						</p>

						<p>
							So this labeling doesn't work and we instead try the labels
						</p>

						<p>
							<me>
								\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
								\cos x
								+
								e^x\
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\sin x}}}
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Noting that <m>f' = [e^x]' = e^x</m> is the other part of the second term and <m>g' = [\sin x]' = \cos x</m> is in the first term confirms this is a valid product rule. Therefore, we can reverse the product rule as
						</p>

						<me>
							e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x = [e^x \cos x]'
						</me>.


					</solution>

					<solution>

						<p>
							To make this easier, let's separate the terms as
							<me>
								\frac{1}{x} e^{x^2} + \ln x (2 x e^{x^2})
							</me>.
						</p>
						
						<p>
							So, as before, we first set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
						</p>

						<me>
							\frac{1}{x}\
							\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^{x^2}}}}
							+
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\ln x}}}\
							2 x e^{x^2}
						</me>,

						<p>
							then verify the derivatives of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are in the other terms,
						</p>

						<me>
							f' = \left[e^{x^2}\right]' = 2 x e^{x^2} \quad ✅ \qquad g' = \left[\ln x\right]' = \frac{1}{x} \quad ✅
						</me>.

						<p>
							Therefore,
						</p>

						<me>
							\frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2} = \left[e^{x^2} \ln x\right]'
						</me>.
					</solution>
				</p>
			</solution>

								+
								\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
								\sin x
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p>
							Based on these choices, we test <m>[f\cdot g]'</m>,
						</p>

						<me>
							[e^x \cos x]' = e^x \cos x + e^x (-\sin x) \neq e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x \quad ❌ 
						</me>
						
						<p>
							and see that this choice doesn't work. Switching our labels to
						</p>

						<me>
							\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}e^x}}}\
							\cos x
							+
							e^x\
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\sin x}}}
						</me>,

						<p>
							identifies the correct <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>, since
						</p>

						<me>
							[e^x \sin x]' = e^x \sin x + e^x \cos x = e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x \quad ✅
						</me>.

						<p>
							Therefore, 
							<me>
								e^x \cos x + e^x \sin x = [e^x \cos x]' \vphantom{\frac11}
							</me>.
						</p>

					</solution>

					<solution>
						
						<p>
							First, rearrange the terms a bit and set <m>f</m> and <m>g</m>
						</p>

						<me>
							\frac{1}{x}\cdot

							+ 2 x 
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\ln x}}}\
							e^{x^2}
						</me>.

						<p>
							Next, verify the derivative of <m>f \cdot g</m>,
						</p>

						<me>
							\left[e^{x^2}\ln x\right]' = e^{x^2}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) + e^{x^2}(2 x) \ln x \os{✅}{=} \frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2}
						</me>.

						<p>
							Therefore,
						</p>

						<me>
							\frac{e^{x^2}}{x} + 2 x \ln x e^{x^2} = \left[e^{x^2} \ln x\right]'

		</example>

		<p>
			The next example involves an expression that contains a variable, making it more relevant to differential equations.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="reversed-product-rule-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule with a Variable </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Rewrite each expression in the form <m>[f(x) y(x)]'</m>.
						<me>
							1. \quad e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9y e^{9x} \hspace{5em} 2. \quad e^{1/x}y' - \frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}y
						</me>
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<solution>
				<p>
					<solution>
						<p>
							Since <m>dy/dx</m> and <m>y</m> are in separate terms, setting <m>g</m> to <m>y</m> gives you <m>g'</m> and <m>f</m> for free since
						</p>

						<me>
							\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{9x}}}}\
							\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
							+
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}\
							(9 e^{9x})
						</me>.

						<p>
							The only thing you need to check is
							<me>
								f' = [e^{9x}]' = 9e^{9x} \quad ✅
							</me>
							which is sitting right next to <m>g</m>. Therefore, we have
						</p>

						<me>
							e^{9x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 9 e^{9x} y = \left[e^{9x} y\right]'
						</me>.

					</solution>

					<solution>

						<p>
							Again, set <m>g</m> to <m>y</m> and the rest fall into place as

						<me>
							\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{1/x}}}}\
							\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y'}}}

							\left(-\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2}\right)\
							\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}
						</me>.

						<p>
							The only thing left to do is verify the derivative of <m>f</m>:
							<me>
								f' = \left[e^{1/x}\right]' = e^{1/x}\left[\frac{1}{x}\right]^\prime = e^{1/x}\left(-\frac{1}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{e^{1/x}}{x^2} \quad ✅
							</me>.
						</p>

						<p>
							So, we can reverse the product rule as

					</solution>

		<p>
			While reversing the product rule is not standard exercise, they are important for developing the intuition needed to understand the integrating factor method, as we will soon see.

	<subsection><title> A Complete Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			Now that you have seen how to combine two terms into a single derivative by reversing the product rule, you are ready to see how this could help you solve a differential equation. Suppose you are given the following equation
		</p>

		<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE">
			\ub{e^{2x} \frac{dy}{dx} + 2e^{2x} y}_{\text{expanded product rule?}} = 5e^{2x}.
		</men>

		<p>
			Seeing the two terms with a derivative suggests that it may be possible to apply a reverse product rule to the left side. In fact, it can and it is not hard to verify that equation <xref ref="reverse-product-rule-DE"/> is equivalent to
		</p>

		<men xml:id="reverse-product-rule-DE-solution">
			\frac{d}{dx} [ e^{2x} y ] = 5e^{2x}.
		</men>

		<p>
			This transformation is powerful because it allows us to solve the equation through direct integration, as illustrated in the next example.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example"><title> Reversed Product Rule in a Differential Equation </title>

			<p>
				<statement>
					<p>
						Find the general solution of the equation
						<men xml:id="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example-eqn">
							e^{x^4} \frac{dy}{dx} + 4x^3e^{x^4} y = 5x
						</men>
						by rewriting the left-side as a single derivative and then direct integration.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</p>

			<p>
				<solution>

					<p>
						To reverse the product rule on the left-side, set <m>g</m> to <m>y</m>, as before, to get 
					</p>

					<me>
						\underset{\Large f}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{x^4}}}}\
						\underset{\Large g'}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}\frac{dy}{dx}}}}
						+
						\underset{\Large g}{ \underset{\uparrow}{\ul{\vphantom{|}y}}}\
						(4x^3 e^{x^4})
					</me>

					<p>
						and checking <m>\ f' = [e^{x^4}]' = 4x^3 e^{x^4}\ </m> confirms that the left side can be combined as a single derivative:
					</p>

					<me>
						e^{x^4} \frac{dy}{dx} + 4x^3e^{x^4} y = \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} y\right]
					</me>.

					<p>
						Now, we update the differential equation <xref ref="reversing-the-product-rule-in-a-DE-example-eqn"/> and integrate as follows:
					</p>

					<md>
						<mrow>			\frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} \cdot y \right]	\amp = 5x										</mrow>
						<mrow>	\int \frac{d}{dx}\left[e^{x^4} \cdot y \right]\ dx	\amp = \int 5x \ dx								</mrow>

						<mrow>													y	\amp = \frac{5}{2} x^2 e^{-x^4} + c e^{-x^4}	</mrow>
					</md>.

				</solution>
			</p>

		</example>

		<p>
			This example shows a differential equation that conveniently had all the pieces it needed to reverse the product rule. Unfortunately, equations are rarely presented in such a complete form and an additional component must be provided before an appoach like this will work. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To help us see how adding something to an equation can help us alter its form and solve it, we will first look at an analogy from algebra in the next section.
		</p>

	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> An Analogy: Completing the Square </title>

		<p>
			Suppose you wanted to solve the following quadratic equation
		</p>

		<men xml:id="quadratic-example">
			x^2 + 6x = -1.
		</men>

		<p>
			You could solve it using the quadratic formula. However, another approach is to <q>complete the square</q> by strategically placing a number on the left side which turns it into a perfect square. Following the rule from <q>completing the square</q>, we know <m>\left(\frac{6}{2}\right)^2 = 9</m> does the trick, so we add it to both sides to get
		</p>

		<me>
			\ub{\os{{\large\text{incomplete}}}{\ob{x^2 + 6x}^{\large\text{square}}} + 9}_{\large\text{complete square}} = -1 + 9.
		</me>

		<p>
			Completing the square gets it name because it tells you the missing piece needed to factor our equation into the form  
		</p>

		<men xml:id="perfect-square">
			(x + 3)^2 = 8.
		</men>

		<p>
			Now, taking a square root releases <m>x</m>, leading directly to the solutions
		</p>

		<me>
			x + 3 = \pm\sqrt{8} \quad \implies \quad x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
		</me>

		<p>
			Just as completing the square tells you that <m>9</m> is the missing piece that makes a <q>perfect</q> square in a quadratic equation, the integrating factor method tells you the missing piece you need to construct a <q>perfect</q> derivative in a differential equation.
		</p>

	</subsection>

	<subsection><title> An Incomplete Product Rule </title>

		<p>
			As mention to in the previous sections, most first-order linear differential equations must be modified before its terms can be combined into a single derivative. To make sense of this, we will look at a concrete example using the differential equation
		</p>

		<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="5% 15% 5% 45% 30%">

			</p>
			<p>
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 6y = -1
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			In this form, the left side resembles an expanded product rule, but if you attempt to reverse it you will see that no choice of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> will work. However, if you multiply both sides by <m>e^{6x}</m>, the equation becomes
		</p>

		<sidebyside valign="middle" widths="5% 15% 5% 45% 30%">

				<me>
					e^{6x}\frac{dy}{dx} + 6e^{6x}y = -e^{6x}
				</me>.
			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			The inclusion of <m>e^{6x}</m> provides the missing piece needed to reverse a product rule and update the equation as

					\frac{d}{dx} [e^{6x} y] = -e^{6x}

			</p>
			<p/>
		</sidebyside>

			With the left side as a single derivative, we can integrate both sides to find <m>y</m>.

	<conclusion>

		<p>
			In sum, solving a differential equation using the integrating factor method is similar to solving a quadratic equation by 
			<q>completing the square</q>. In both cases, we strategically augment the equations by introducing a missing component

		</p>

		<p>
			In the next section, we will learn that this missing factor is known as the <term>integrating factor</term> and we will derive a general formula for finding it.
