	<chapter><title> What's a Differential Equation? </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				In this introductory section, we'll describe what a differential equation is from the perspective of algebra and calculus. Then, we'll delve into the concepts of independent and dependent variables, which play crucial roles in the structure and solutions of differential equations. By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of these fundamental ideas, setting the stage for learning the methods to find and analyze solutions of differential equations.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> An Analogy </title>
			<p>
				When you're learning something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. 
				To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might 
				feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for <m>y</m>:
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<p><me>y + 3 = 11</me></p>
				<p><me>y + 3x = 11</me></p>
				<p><me>y^\prime + 3x = 11</me></p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				All three are equations with the same goal—finding the unknown <m>y</m>. However, only the third equation 
				is a <em>differential equation</em> because it contains a derivative. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's try solving for <m>y</m> in each case.
			</p>

			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y + 3 =\amp\ 11</mrow>
						<mrow>y =\amp\ 8</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y + 3x =\amp\ 11</mrow>
						<mrow>y =\amp\ 11 - 3x</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>y^\prime + 3x =\amp\ 11</mrow>
						<mrow>y^\prime =\amp\ 11 - 3x</mrow>
						<mrow>y =\amp\ ?</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				In the first equation, we found that <m>y</m> is a number, and in the second, it's a function of <m>x</m>. 
				But in the third equation, how do we solve for <m>y</m> when there is a derivative attached to it? 
				This is exactly the kind of question that differential equations aim to answer. 
			</p>

			<p>
				We'll dive deeper into solving these types of equations soon. For now, there's still plenty more to learn 
				about the basics, so let's keep going!

			<p>
				Here is the formal definition of a differential equation.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="def-de">
				<title>Differential Equation</title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						A <term>differential equation (DE)</term> is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. If the function depends on a single variable, the equation is an <term>ordinary differential equation (ODE)</term>. 
						Otherwise, it is called a <term>partial differential equation (PDE)</term>.
					</p>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				<note xml:id="de-convention"><title>Convention: DE means ODE</title>
					<p>
						Since this text focuses exclusively on ordinary differential equations, any use of <em>DE</em> will imply <em>ODE</em>.
					</p>
				</note>
				According to the definition, a differential equation must include at least one derivative (e.g., <m>f^\prime</m>, <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>) and an equality sign ("="). This distinction helps us identify the following expressions as differential equations:
				<me>
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime)
				</me>
				In contrast, the following are not differential equations because they either lack a derivative or an equality sign:
				<me>
					\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0
				</me>
			</p>

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Variables </title>
			<p>
				In this section, we'll explore the two types of variables found in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. Understanding the roles of these variables is crucial when solving and interpreting differential equations.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Consider the differential equation:
				<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
					\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 3x^2.
				</men>
				This equation involves two variables: <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. One of these variables is the unknown that we are trying to solve for, but which one?
			</p>

			<p>
				Typically, the variable you want to solve for is the one with a derivative applied to it. Here, the term <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> in <xref ref="variables-de-1" /> indicates:
				<ol>
					<li><p>The derivative is being taken with respect to <m>x</m>, and</p></li>
					<li><p><m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> (since it wouldn't make sense to take the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> unless <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>).</p></li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, <m>y</m> is called the <em>dependent variable</em> because it depends on <m>x</m>. On the other hand, <m>x</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="types-of-variables"><title> Dependent &amp; Independent Variables </title>
				<statement>
					<dl>

						</li>
						<li xml:id="def-independent-variable"><title>Independent Variable:</title>
							<p>
								The variable that the dependent variable is a function of. It does not have a derivative applied to it.

											<li><m>u</m> is a function of <m>t</m> and is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
											<li><m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Terms &amp; Coefficients </title>
			<p>
				This text will frequently refer to <q>terms</q> and <q>coefficients</q>. Here is the definition.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="def-terms-coefficients"><title> Terms &amp; Coefficients </title>
				<statement>
					<p>
						In differential equations, terms and coefficients are defined as follows:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<li xml:id="def-terms"><title>Terms</title>
							<p>
								The expressions separated by <m>+</m>, <m>-</m>, or <m>=</m> signs.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="def-coefficients"><title>Coefficients</title>
							<p>
								The objects multiplied by the dependent variable or one of its derivatives.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li xml:id="def-constant-term"><title>Constant Term</title>
							<p>
								A term without a dependent variable is called a <term>constant term</term> and is not a coefficient.
							</p>
						</li>
					</dl>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				Consider the differential equation:
				<men xml:id="terms-and-coefficients-equation">
					\us{y^{(6)}	\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ \frac{3}{x}	{\color{blue}\ y^{(6)}	}	}	} +
					\us{y''		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		5.3	{\color{blue}\ y''		} 	}	} +
					\us{y' 		\text{ term}	}{\ub{\ 		x^2	{\color{blue}\ y'		} 	}	} -
					\us{y 		\text{ term}	}{\us{\uparrow}{	{\color{blue}\ \ul{y}	} 	}	} =
					\us{\text{constant term}	}{\ub{\ \frac12\ln(x)\ 							}	}
				</men>.
				This equation has five terms and four coefficients: <m>\frac{3}{x}</m>, <m>5.3</m>, <m>x^2</m>, and <m>-1</m>. Notice that coefficients can be <em>functions of the independent variable</em> (like <m>\frac{3}{x}</m> and <m>x^2</m>) or <em>constants</em> (like <m>5.3</m> and <m>-1</m>). The distinction between constant and variable coefficients will become crucial when we study a group of differential equations known as <em>constant-coefficient equations</em>.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="terms-and-coefficients"><title> <em>Terms &amp; Coefficients in a Differential Equation</em> </title>
			
				<statement>
					<p>
						Identify the terms and coefficients of the differential equation
					</p>
					<me>
						3t^2\ y' - 4\cos t + \frac{y'y}{t} - 515 y = 0
					</me>
				</statement>

				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						The equation can be broken down as follows:
						<me>
							\us{y' \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 3t^2{\color{blue} y'}\ }} -
							\us{\text{constant term}}{\ub{\ 4\cos t\ }} +
							\us{y'y \text{ term}}{\ub{\ \frac{1}{t}{\color{blue} y'y}\ }} - 
							\us{y \text{ term}}{\ub{\ 515{\color{blue} y}\ }} = 0
						</me>.
						The coefficients are <m>3t^2</m>, <m>\frac{1}{t}</m>, and <m>-515</m>. Notice that <m>3t^2</m> and <m>\frac{1}{t}</m> are functions of the independent variable <m>t</m>, whereas <m>-515</m> is a constant.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Order </title>
			<p>
				In this section, we'll explore a key concept in differential equations known as <term>order</term>. Think of the order of a differential equation as the number of layers or steps you need to peel away to reveal the original function. The more layers there are, the higher the order, and usually, the more complex the equation.
			</p>
			
			<definition xml:id="def-order">
				<statement>
					<p>
						The <term>order</term> of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative that appears in the equation. For example, if the highest derivative is the first derivative, it's called a <em>first-order</em> differential equation. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, it's called a <em>second-order</em> differential equation, and so on.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Linear Terms </title>
			<p>
				The most informative label you can place on a differential equation is whether it is linear or nonlinear. While linearity often refers to equations that graph as straight lines, the concept of linearity in differential equations is more nuanced. Understanding this distinction is crucial as it significantly influences how the equations are solved and interpreted.
			</p>

			<p>
				Before jumping in, it may be helpful to revisit meaning of <xref ref="def-dependent-variable" text="custom">dependent</xref> variables, <xref ref="def-terms" text="custom">terms</xref> and <xref ref="def-coefficients" text="custom">coefficients</xref> as we will be referencing them throughout this discussion.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now, let's define what it means for a term in a differential equation to be linear.
			</p>
			
			<definition><title> Linear Term </title>
				<statement>
					<dl width="normal">
						<li xml:id="def-linear-term"><title>Linear Term</title>
							<p>
								A term that has one of the forms
							</p>
							<p>
								<me>a(t)\ y,\ a(t)\ y',\ a(t)\ y'',\ a(t)\ y''',\ \ldots</me>
							</p>
							<p>
								where <m>y</m> is the dependent variable. The coefficient, <m>a(t)</m>, can be a function of the independent variable, <m>t</m>, but not the dependent variable.
							</p>
						</li>
					</dl>
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<note><title> The linearity of a term depends entirely on the dependent variable </title>
				<p>
					The linearity of a term is determined by the presence of a single <m>y</m> or derivative of <m>y</m> to the power of <m>1</m>. The coefficients, <m>a(t)</m> play no part in the linearity.
				</p>
			</note>

			<example>

				<m>\ \ </m>Given the differential equation,
				<me>
					e^{t}y^{(7)} + (t+1)y'y''' - t \ln y'' - y' \sin t - \tan y + \frac{4}{y} = \frac{3}{t}
				</me>,
				identify each term and label the term as linear or nonlinear.

				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						To determine the linearity of a term we only need to consider the dependent variables (column <m>3</m> below). We are looking for a single <m>y</m> or derivative of <m>y</m> raised to the power of <m>1</m>. If we find such a term, we label it as linear. Otherwise, it is nonlinear. Let's separate the different parts in the following table.

			<p>
				In the world of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is vital. This distinction will often guide you on how to approach solving the equation and what methods to use. The good news is, all the work we did in the previous section will make this task much easier.
			</p>

			<definition xml:id="def-linear">
				<statement>
					A differential equation is <term> linear </term> if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be expressed as
					<men xml:id="linear-equation">
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_n(t)y^{(n)}}} + \cdots + 
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_2(t)y''}} + 
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_1(t)y'}} +
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{a_0(t)y}} = 
						\underset{\text{linear term}}{\underbrace{f(t).}}
					</men>
					If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is <term> nonlinear </term>.
				</statement>
			</definition>

			<p>
				This definition might seem abstract at first, but it encompasses all possible linear differential equations. In practice, most equations you'll encounter will involve only a few terms, and the challenge lies in identifying whether any of those terms break the rule of linearity. If they do, the equation is nonlinear.
			</p>

			<example>
				<m>\ \ </m>Let's determine whether the following differential equation is linear:
				
				<me>y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y = 17t</me>
			
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						To classify this equation, we need to verify if every term involving <m>y</m> and its derivatives is linear. Let's break it down term by term:
					</p>
					<md>
						<mrow> y'' + \frac{y'}{t^2} + y =\ 17t </mrow>
						<mrow> 
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y''}}} + 
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{\frac{1}{t^2} y'}}} + 
							\underset{\text{linear}}{\underline{\color{blue}{y}}} = 
							\underset{\text{constant term}}{\underline{\color{blue}{17t}}}
						</mrow>
					</md>
					<p>
						Since each term involving <m>y</m> or its derivatives is linear, this differential equation is indeed linear.
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>
			
			<p>
				In summary, recognizing whether a differential equation is linear or nonlinear will help you determine the appropriate methods for solving it. Linear equations allow for a more straightforward approach, while nonlinear equations often require specialized techniques.

	<chapter><title> Solutions </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				The primary goal of any introductory differential equations course is to explore a variety of techniques for solving differential equations. In fact, the majority of questions you will see in this course begin with "Solve the following Differential Equation." You may be so conditioned to this statement that you will find the solution, circle the answer and move on. This leads many students to struggle with the following natural follow-up question:
				<blockquote>
					<em> <q>What does it mean to be a solution to a Differential Equation?</q> </em>
				</blockquote>
				This section will guide you through different aspects of solutions, including general solutions, particular solutions, and the role of initial conditions in specifying a unique solution. By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of how solutions behave and how they are characterized, which will set the stage for more advanced methods of finding these solutions in later chapters.
			</p>
		</introduction>
		
		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> What is a Solution? </title>
			<p>
				Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that <q>satisfies</q> the equation. The term <em>satisfies</em> simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true.
				<fn>This <q>undeniably true</q> statement is sometimes called an identity.</fn> 
				For example, suppose I want to check if <m>y=2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> are solutions to the equation 
				<me>
					y^3 = 3y + 2 
				</me>.
				To do this, we verify that both <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> <em>satisfy</em> the equation by separately plugging <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> in for each <m>y</m>, simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> (2)^3 	=\amp\ 3(2) + 2								</mrow>
							<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 6 + 2								</mrow>
							<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 8	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow> (0)^3 	=\amp\ 3(0) + 2								</mrow>
							<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 0 + 2								</mrow>
							<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 2	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				Since <m>y=2</m> yields an true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, <m>y=0</m> does not give a true statement, so it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that <em>solutions to differential equations are functions instead of numbers</em>. To see this, let's verify if <m>y = 3x</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> are solutions to the differential equation
				<m>
					\displaystyle y^\prime = 3y
				</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Separately plugging <m>3x</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m> into the equation yields
				<sidebyside>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>				y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y									</mrow>
							<mrow> \left[3x\right]^\prime 	=\amp\ 3(3x)								</mrow>
							<mrow> 3 						=\amp\ 9x	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						<md>
							<mrow>							y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y										</mrow>
							<mrow> \left[e^{3x}\right]^\prime 			=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
							<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot \left[3x\right]^\prime	=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
							<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot 3						=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
							<mrow> 3e^{3x}								=\amp\ 3e^{3x}	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</sidebyside>
				Since <m>y=3x</m> results in a false statement, it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution. However, <m>y=e^{3x}</m> does satisfy the equation and is a solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				To summarize, verifying a solution involves substituting the function into the differential equation and ensuring that the equality is satisfied.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Verifying Solutions </title>
			<p>
				In the previous section, we discussed what it means for a function to be a solution to a differential equation. Now, we turn our attention to how we can verify that a proposed function is indeed a solution.
			</p>

			<p>
				The process of verifying a solution is straightforward: you substitute the proposed function into the differential equation and check whether the equation holds true. This simple test helps ensure that the function satisfies the relationship defined by the differential equation.

				<note xml:id="move-terms-when-verifying"><title>Tip: Before verifying, move all terms to one side</title>
					Remember, the following differential equations are identical:
					<me>
						y^\prime = 3y \quad \text{and} \quad y^\prime - 3y = 0
					</me>.
					Meaning that you are free to use either form when verifying solutions. For beginners, it is often easier to verify solutions using the second form, as you just have to show the left-side of equation simplifies to zero, giving you <m>0=0</m>.
				</note>
				Let's look at a few examples.
			</p>

			<example>

				<p>
					Verify the given solutions for each differential equation.
					A. Verify that <m>\ y= 2x^2\ </m> is a solution to <m>\ xy' - 2x^2 = y</m>.
				</p>
				
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						Let's begin by moving all terms to the left-side of the equation.
						<me>xy' - 2x^2 - y = 0</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						To reduce errors and break the problem into more manageable steps, we will compute and simplify the derivatives appearing in the equation.
						<me>
							y	= 2x^2,	\quad	y' = 4x
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Finally, we substitute in <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> and simplify.
						<md>
							<mrow> 									xy' - 2x^2 - y	=\amp\ 0								</mrow>
							<mrow> x\left(4x\right) - 2x^2 - \left( 2x^2 \right)	=\amp\ 0 								</mrow>
							<mrow>								4x^2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2	=\amp\ 0								</mrow>
							<mrow>												0	=\amp\ 0\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
						</md>
						Therefore, <m>y= 2x^2</m> is a solution to <m>xy' - 2x^2 = y.</m>
					</p>
				</solution>

				<p>
					B. Verify that <m>\ P = \sin t\ </m> is a solution to <m>\ 2P'' + P = \sin t</m>.
				</p>

				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						As before, we compute <m>P''</m> since it appears in the equation and move all terms to the left-side.
						<me>	
							P = \sin t, \quad P' = \cos t, \quad P'' = -\sin t
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Plug <m>P</m> and <m>P''</m> in and simplify.
						<md>
							<mrow> 							2P'' + P - \sin t	=\amp\ 0									</mrow>
							<mrow> 2\left( -\sin t \right) + \sin t - \sin t	=\amp\ 0									</mrow>

							<mrow> 									-2\sin t	=\amp\ 0\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
						</md>
						Therefore, <m>P = \sin t</m> is <term> not a solution </term> to <m>2P'' + P = \sin t.</m>
					</p>
				</solution>

			</example>

			<example xml:id="de-two-solutions">

				<m>\ \ </m>Verify that both <m>y= 2e^{-3t}</m> and <m>y= e^{4t}</m> are solutions to

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Types of Solutions </title>
			<p>
				At this point, you should comfortable with the idea that <em> a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies it </em>. You have also seen that <xref ref="de-two-solutions" text="custom"> a single differential equation can have more than one solution </xref>. However, this begs the question: 
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						<em><q>How many solutions does a differential equation have?</q></em>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				The answer depends on the context of the problem, and that's what we will explore in this section. Let's kick things off with an example.
			</p>

			<example xml:id="verification-with-a-constant">
				<m>\ \ </m> Show that the functions 
				<me>y = e^{2x},\ \ y = 2e^{2x},\ \ y = 3e^{2x},\ \ y = -7e^{2x},\ \ y = 0.3e^{2x},\ \ y = \pi e^{2x} </me> 
				are solutions to the differential equation
				<m>\quad y' - 2y = 0</m>.
				<solution><title> Solution </title>
					<p>
						Verifying each function individually would be repetitive because they all follow the same pattern: 
						<me>y = (\text{some number})\ e^{2x} \quad \text{or} \quad y = c e^{2x} </me>, where <m>c</m> can be any constant. Let's prove that <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution.
					</p>
					<p>
						First, compute <m>y'</m>:
						<md>
							<mrow>	y		=\amp\	c e^{2x}						</mrow>
							<mrow>	y'		=\amp\	2c e^{2x}	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
					<p>
						Now, substitute <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> into the differential equation:
						<md>
							<mrow> 					y' - 2y	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2(c e^{2x})	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2c e^{2x}	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
							<mrow> 						0	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						</md>
						<p>
							Therefore, <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution, and the specific value of <m>c</m> does not matter.
						</p>
				</solution>

			</example>

			<p>
				From the above example, you can see that the function <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> satisfies the differential equation for any value of <m>c</m>. This leads to an important observation:
				<blockquote>
					<em><q>How many choices for <m>c</m> are there?</q></em>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Of course, the answer is infinitely many! This means the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m> has an infinite number of solutions. This brings us to some key terms related to solutions of differential equations.</p>

			<note><title> <em>Don't assume a function that satisfies a DE is a general solution!</em> </title>
				<p>
					A function that contains constants and satisfies a differential equation <em>does not mean it is the general solution</em> since it could be missing a term. For example, you could easily show that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x</m> is a solution to 
					<me>\quad y'' = 1</me>, 
					but you already know from <xref ref="two-constant-solution-verification"/> that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2</m> is a solution, which is more general than <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x</m>.
				</p>
			</note>

			<definition xml:id="types-of-solutions"><title>Types of Solutions</title>

			<p>
				Applying these terms to our previous example, we can summarize that:
				<ul>
					<li><m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is the <em>general solution</em> of the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m>.</li>
					<li><m>y = 5e^{2x}</m> is one <em>particular solution</em> in the <em>family of solutions</em>.</li>
					<li>The <em>family of solutions</em> consists of all functions of the form <m>y = c e^{2x}</m>.</li>

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Visualizing Solutions </title>
			<p>
				A powerful way to understand solutions to differential equations is by visualizing them. Consider the differential equation
				<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
				which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> (<xref ref="p1-c2-s4-details-1" text="custom">solution verification details</xref>).
			</p>	

			<p>
				Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ (see <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" />).
			</p>
			
			<sidebyside widths="46% 2% 50%" margins="0%">

					</p>
					<ul marker="square">
						<li> 
							Each green curve in the figure represents a particular solution, with its own specific value of <m>c</m>.
						</li>
						<li>

			</sidebyside>

			<p>
				Although the figure only shows a few members of the infinite family of solutions, notice that the green curves never overlap. This means that each curve represents a unique solution. If you were to randomly select a point on the plot, you would, in effect, be selecting a single curve—only one solution can pass through that specific point. This idea is at the heart of where particular solution come from and it will be the focus of the next section.

		<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Initial Conditions &amp; Particular Solutions </title>
			<p>
				Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines all the possible solutions (family of solutions). For example, later on in this text, we will show that the differential equation
				<men xml:id="initial-condition-de">y'' - y' - 12y = 0</men>
				has the general solution
				<men xml:id="initial-condition-gen-sol">y(t) = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}.</men>
				While the general solution gives us a family of possible solutions, in practical scenarios, we are usually interested in the specific solution where the constants are known. This is where initial conditions come into play—they allow us to determine the particular solution that applies to the problem at hand.
			</p>

			<p>
				An <term>initial condition</term> is a starting value of the solution or its derivatives. For example, consider the free fall of an object due to gravity where <m>s(t)</m> is the position (distance from the ground) of this object at time <m>t</m>. Assuming the ball is dropped from the top of a 100 ft building, what initial information do you know? Let <m>t=0</m> be the time when the ball is dropped, then the initial conditions are given in the following table.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following table summarizes the initial conditions for our example, highlighting the key information required to determine the particular solution:
			</p>

			<p>
				<tabular>
					<col right="minor" halign="center"/>
					<col halign="center"/>
					<row bottom="minor">
					<cell>Information at <m>t=0</m></cell>
					<cell>Initial Condition</cell>
					</row>
					<row>
					<cell>The ball is at the top of a 100 ft building.</cell>
					<cell><m>s(0) = 100 \text{ ft}</m></cell>
					</row>
					<row>
					<cell>The ball is dropped from rest (initial velocity is zero).</cell>
					<cell><m>s'(0) = 0 \text{ ft/s}</m></cell>
					</row>
				</tabular>
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Without these initial conditions, the solution is incomplete and not applicable to any specific scenario. Assuming the solution must be consistent with these conditions forces the constants in the general solution to take specific values, giving us a particular solution.
			</p>
			
			<example>
			
				<m>\ \ </m>Solve the initial value problem
				<me> y'' - y' - 12y = 0, \quad y(0) = 4, \quad y'(0) = -2</me>.

					<p>

						<me>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</me>. 
						If you are interested in the verification steps, see the solution below.
					</p>
				
					<solution><title>Verification as a solution</title>

						<p>

								<mrow> y''	=\amp\ 9c_1e^{-3t} + 16c_2e^{4t}	</mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
					
						<p>
							and substitute these into <m>y'' - y' - 12y</m> and simplify:
							<md>
								<mrow>

								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ 0
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Which shows <m>0 = 0</m> and so <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m> is a solution.
						</p>
				</solution>

					<p>
						We would like determine the spcific values of <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> that correspond to the initial conditions <m>y(0) = 4</m> and <m>y'(0) = -2</m>. 
					</p>

					<p>
						Since one initial condition involves the derivative, we will need to compute this before applying this condition.
						<me>y' = -3c_1e^{-3t} + 4c_2e^{4t}.</me>
					</p>
				
					<p>
						Now let's apply the initial conditions:
						<md>
						<mrow>y(0)	=\amp\ 4		\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 	4

						<mrow>			\amp	\amp	-5	=\amp\ -3c_1 + 4c_2	</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				
					<p>
						We now have two equations and two unknowns,

							<mrow>	 c_1 +	c_2	=\amp\ 	4 	</mrow>
							<mrow> -3c_1 + 4c_2	=\amp\ -5 	</mrow>
						</md>
						There are multiple ways to solve this system of equations, and the reader is encouraged to verify that	<m>c_1 = 3</m> and <m>c_2 = 1</m>. Here is one
				
						<solution><title>Solving for <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m></title>

				In summary, the process of solving a differential equation typically begins with finding a general solution. However, to apply this solution to real-world problems, we rely on initial conditions to determine a particular solution that accurately represents the system's specific circumstances.

						Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the general solution of a differential equation.
					</p>
					<answer><title>Answer</title>
						<p>
							<line>
							The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the
							solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the
							constants in the general solution.
							</line>
							<line>
							Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the
							family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a
							single particular solution.

						Find the particular solution such that <m>y(0) = 7</m>.
					</p>
					<answer><title>Answer</title>
						<p>
							<line>b. <m>\ds y=\frac{1}{1+ce^{-x}}</m></line>
						<line>
						<m>c = \frac{1}{7}-1 \approx -0.857</m>, so
						<m>\ds y = \frac{1}{1+(-0.857)e^{-x}} </m> is the particular solution
						</line>
						</p>
					</answer>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
					<line>Try <m>y=\frac{1}{c+x^2}</m> first.</line>
						<line>Compute</line>
						<line> <m>y^\prime = \frac{-4x}{(c+x^2)^2}</m> </line>
						<line> <m>y-y^2 = \frac{1}{c+x^2} - \frac{1}{(c+x^2)^2}
										= \frac{c+x^2}{(c+x^2)^2} - \frac{1}{(c+x^2)^2}
										= \frac{c+x^2-1}{(c+x^2)^2}</m></line>
						<line>So <m>y^\prime\neq y-y^2</m> for this function, it is not the solution.</line>
						<line>Now try <m>y=\frac{1}{1+ce^{-x}}</m>. Then</line>

						<line><m>y^\prime = \frac{ce^{-x}}{1+ce^{-x}}</m></line>
						<line>while</line>
						<line><m>y-y^2=\frac{1}{1+ce^{-x}}-\frac{1}{(1+ce^{-x})^2}
									=\frac{1+ce^{-x}}{(1+ce^{-x})^2}-\frac{1}{(1+ce^{-x})^2}
									=\frac{ce^{-x}}{(1+ce^{-x})^2}</m></line>
						<line>So this function is the solution</line>
						<line>Setting <m>y(0)=$y0</m> we get</line>
						<line><m>$y0 = \frac{1}{1+c}</m></line>
						<line>Solve for c, <m>c = \frac{1}{$y0}-1=$c</m></line>
						<line>So the solution for the IVP is <m>y = \frac{1}{1+(-0.857)e^{-x}}</m></line>

						We need to substitute into the DE. In order to substitute into the left hand side, we need to know the second derivative. So we begin by finding that.

							</md>
							
							Now we can substitute into the DE:
							
							<md>
							<mrow>\text{LHS}=\amp\ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y								</mrow>

							<mrow>			=\amp\ \text{RHS}										</mrow>

							Since when we substitute in to the DE, we find that the LHS is equal to the RHS, we have verified that <m>y = c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x</m> is a solution to the DE <m>\ds \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y = 0.</m>

							We proceed as in the previous question. First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE.
							<md>
								<mrow>						y	=\amp\ x^m								</mrow>
								<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y'	=\amp\ mx^{m-1}							</mrow>
								<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y''	=\amp\ m(m-1)x^{m-2}						</mrow>	
							</md> 
							Now we can substitute into the DE:
							<md>
								<mrow>				3x^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}	=\amp\ 
									-11x \frac{dy}{dx} + 3y						</mrow>
								<mrow>		3x^2\Big[ m(m-1)x^{m-2} \Big]	=\amp\

								<mrow>					3m(m-1)x^2 x^{m-2}	=\amp\ 
									-11mx^1\cdot x^{m-1} + 3x^m					</mrow>
								<mrow>				(3m^2 - 3m)x^{2+(m-2)}	=\amp\

								<mrow>					(3m^2 - 3m)x^{m}	=\amp\ -11m x^{m} + 3x^m		</mrow>
								<mrow>(3m^2 - 3m)x^{m} + 11m x^{m} - 3x^m	=\amp\ 0						</mrow>

								<mrow>						(3m -1)(m+3)x^m	=\amp\ 0						</mrow>	
							</md>
							Note that there is no value of <m>m</m> that can guarantee that <m>x^m</m> is 0.
