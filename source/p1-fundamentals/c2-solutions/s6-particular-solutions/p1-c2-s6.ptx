	<p>
		When you <q>solve</q> a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" /> shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the <m>t, y</m>-plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose we want the solution to the differential equation 
		<me> \displaystyle \frac{dy}{dt} = 2ty - 6t, \quad y(0) = 2 </me>.
		Etcept for the initial condition, this is the same equation we solved in the previous section, which has the general solution 
		<men xml:id="p1-c2-s5-example-1">y = ce^{t^2} + 3</men>. 
		The initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, tells us that "<m>y</m> must equal 2 when <m>t</m> is 0". When we substitute <m>y=2</m> and <m>t=0</m> into <xref ref="p1-c2-s5-example-1" />, we see that we can solve for <m>c</m>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<md>
			<mrow> y =  ce^{t^2} + 3 \quad \overset{y\ =\ 2,\ t\ =\ 0}{\Rightarrow} \quad	2	=\amp\  ce^{0^2} + 3	</mrow>
			<mrow>							 												2	=\amp\  c + 3		</mrow>
			<mrow>																			-1	=\amp\  c			</mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, <m>y(0) = 2</m> forces <m>c = -1</m> and we get the particular solution
		<me>y = -e^{t^2} + 3</me>.
		In <xref ref="initial-conditions-figure-1" /> can see the initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, as the point <m>(0,2)</m> on the <m>y</m>-axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.

				In the graph, the point on the <m>y</m>-axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the <m>y</m>-axis.
			</p>

			<p>
				As you drag the point, make the following observations:
			</p>

			<ul marker="square">
				<li> 
					Each new value of <m>y(0)</m> gives a new value of <m>c</m>, which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve). 
				</li>
				<li> 
					Only one particular solution from the family of solutions (green curves) passes through the initial condition.  
				</li>

	<exercise>

		<m>\ \ </m> Solve the differential equation <m>\ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x. </m>

		<solution>

			<p>
				The general solution to this differential equation is
				<me> y = Ce^{x^2} + 3. </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find the specific value of <m>C</m>, we need to use an initial condition. Let's say we know that <m>y(0) = 0</m>. This means that when <m>x = 0</m>, then <m>y = 0</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We can substitute these values of <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> into our general solution and solve for <m>C</m>.
				<md>
					<mrow> y =\amp\  Ce ^{x^2} + 3	\amp\Rightarrow \hspace{0.2cm} 0	=\amp\  Ce^{0^2} + 3</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp				\amp						 0	=\amp\  C + 3</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp				\amp						-3	=\amp\  C</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the particular solution that satisfies the differential equation and the initial condition is
				<me> y = -3e^{x^2} + 3. </me>
			</p>
			
		</solution>

        <p>
            In this example, we used the initial condition <m>y(0) = 0</m> to find the specific value of the constant <m>C</m> in the general solution. This allowed us to find a particular solution that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            In the exercises that follow, you will have the opportunity to practice finding particular solutions using initial conditions.
