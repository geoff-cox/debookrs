        The primary goal of any introductory differential equations course is to explore a variety of techniques for solving differential equations. In fact, the majority of questions you will see in this course begin with "Solve the following Differential Equation." You may be so conditioned to this statement that you will find the solution, circle the answer and move on. This leads many students to struggle with the following natural follow-up question:
        <blockquote>
            <em> <q>What does it mean to be a solution to a Differential Equation?</q> </em>
        </blockquote>
        This section will guide you through different aspects of solutions, including general solutions, particular solutions, and the role of initial conditions in specifying a unique solution. By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of how solutions behave and how they are characterized, which will set the stage for more advanced methods of finding these solutions in later chapters.
