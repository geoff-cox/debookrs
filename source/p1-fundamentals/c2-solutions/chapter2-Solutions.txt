<chapter><title> Solutions </title>
	<introduction>
		<p>
			The primary goal of any introductory differential equations course is to explore a variety of techniques for solving differential equations. In fact, the majority of questions you will see in this course begin with "Solve the following Differential Equation." You may be so conditioned to this statement that you will find the solution, circle the answer and move on. This leads many students to struggle with the following natural follow-up question:
			<blockquote>
				<em> <q>What does it mean to be a solution to a Differential Equation?</q> </em>
			</blockquote>
			This section will guide you through different aspects of solutions, including general solutions, particular solutions, and the role of initial conditions in specifying a unique solution. By the end of this section, you will have a deeper understanding of how solutions behave and how they are characterized, which will set the stage for more advanced methods of finding these solutions in later chapters.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> What is a Solution? </title>
		<p>
			Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that <q>satisfies</q> the equation. The term <em>satisfies</em> simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true.
			<fn>This <q>undeniably true</q> statement is sometimes called an identity.</fn> 
			For example, suppose I want to check if <m>y=2</m> and <m>y = 0</m> are solutions to the equation 
			<me>
				y^3 = 3y + 2 
			</me>.
			To do this, we verify that both <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> <em>satisfy</em> the equation by separately plugging <m>2</m> and <m>0</m> in for each <m>y</m>, simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> (2)^3 	=\amp\ 3(2) + 2								</mrow>
						<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 6 + 2								</mrow>
						<mrow> 8 		=\amp\ 8	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow> (0)^3 	=\amp\ 3(0) + 2								</mrow>
						<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 0 + 2								</mrow>
						<mrow> 0 		=\amp\ 2	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Since <m>y=2</m> yields an true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, <m>y=0</m> does not give a true statement, so it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that <em>solutions to differential equations are functions instead of numbers</em>. To see this, let's verify if <m>y = 3x</m> and <m>y = e^{3x}</m> are solutions to the differential equation
			<m>
				\displaystyle y^\prime = 3y
			</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Separately plugging <m>3x</m> and <m>e^{3x}</m> into the equation yields
			<sidebyside>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>				y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y									</mrow>
						<mrow> \left[3x\right]^\prime 	=\amp\ 3(3x)								</mrow>
						<mrow> 3 						=\amp\ 9x	\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					<md>
						<mrow>							y^\prime 	=\amp\ 3y										</mrow>
						<mrow> \left[e^{3x}\right]^\prime 			=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
						<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot \left[3x\right]^\prime	=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
						<mrow> e^{3x} \cdot 3						=\amp\ 3e^{3x}									</mrow>
						<mrow> 3e^{3x}								=\amp\ 3e^{3x}	\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
			</sidebyside>
			Since <m>y=3x</m> results in a false statement, it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution. However, <m>y=e^{3x}</m> does satisfy the equation and is a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			To summarize, verifying a solution involves substituting the function into the differential equation and ensuring that the equality is satisfied.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Verifying Solutions </title>
		<p>
			In the previous section, we discussed what it means for a function to be a solution to a differential equation. Now, we turn our attention to how we can verify that a proposed function is indeed a solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			The process of verifying a solution is straightforward: you substitute the proposed function into the differential equation and check whether the equation holds true. This simple test helps ensure that the function satisfies the relationship defined by the differential equation.

			<note xml:id="move-terms-when-verifying"><title>Tip: Before verifying, move all terms to one side</title>
				Remember, the following differential equations are identical:
				<me>
					y^\prime = 3y \quad \text{and} \quad y^\prime - 3y = 0
				</me>.
				Meaning that you are free to use either form when verifying solutions. For beginners, it is often easier to verify solutions using the second form, as you just have to show the left-side of equation simplifies to zero, giving you <m>0=0</m>.
			</note>
			Let's look at a few examples.
		</p>

		<example>

			<p>
				Verify the given solutions for each differential equation.
				A. Verify that <m>\ y= 2x^2\ </m> is a solution to <m>\ xy' - 2x^2 = y</m>.
			</p>
			
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					Let's begin by moving all terms to the left-side of the equation.
					<me>xy' - 2x^2 - y = 0</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					To reduce errors and break the problem into more manageable steps, we will compute and simplify the derivatives appearing in the equation.
					<me>
						y	= 2x^2,	\quad	y' = 4x
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					Finally, we substitute in <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> and simplify.
					<md>
						<mrow> 									xy' - 2x^2 - y	=\amp\ 0								</mrow>
						<mrow> x\left(4x\right) - 2x^2 - \left( 2x^2 \right)	=\amp\ 0 								</mrow>
						<mrow>								4x^2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2	=\amp\ 0								</mrow>
						<mrow>												0	=\amp\ 0\quad \leftarrow \text{true}	</mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>y= 2x^2</m> is a solution to <m>xy' - 2x^2 = y.</m>
				</p>
			</solution>

			<p>
				B. Verify that <m>\ P = \sin t\ </m> is a solution to <m>\ 2P'' + P = \sin t</m>.
			</p>

			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					As before, we compute <m>P''</m> since it appears in the equation and move all terms to the left-side.
					<me>	
						P = \sin t, \quad P' = \cos t, \quad P'' = -\sin t
					</me>
				</p>

				<p>
					Plug <m>P</m> and <m>P''</m> in and simplify.
					<md>
						<mrow> 							2P'' + P - \sin t	=\amp\ 0									</mrow>
						<mrow> 2\left( -\sin t \right) + \sin t - \sin t	=\amp\ 0									</mrow>

						<mrow> 									-2\sin t	=\amp\ 0\quad \leftarrow \text{false}	</mrow>
					</md>
					Therefore, <m>P = \sin t</m> is <term> not a solution </term> to <m>2P'' + P = \sin t.</m>
				</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<example xml:id="de-two-solutions">

			<m>\ \ </m>Verify that both <m>y= 2e^{-3t}</m> and <m>y= e^{4t}</m> are solutions to

		<p>
			You can even verify that a function is a solution to a differential equation when the function contains constants as the following example shows.

					<fn>
						In fact, it is the general solution, but we don't show that here.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Types of Solutions </title>
		<p>
			At this point, you should comfortable with the idea that <em> a solution to a differential equation is a function that satisfies it </em>. You have also seen that <xref ref="de-two-solutions" text="custom"> a single differential equation can have more than one solution </xref>. However, this begs the question: 
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<em><q>How many solutions does a differential equation have?</q></em>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			The answer depends on the context of the problem, and that's what we will explore in this section. Let's kick things off with an example.
		</p>

		<example xml:id="verification-with-a-constant">
			<m>\ \ </m> Show that the functions 
			<me>y = e^{2x},\ \ y = 2e^{2x},\ \ y = 3e^{2x},\ \ y = -7e^{2x},\ \ y = 0.3e^{2x},\ \ y = \pi e^{2x} </me> 
			are solutions to the differential equation
			<m>\quad y' - 2y = 0</m>.
			<solution><title> Solution </title>
				<p>
					Verifying each function individually would be repetitive because they all follow the same pattern: 
					<me>y = (\text{some number})\ e^{2x} \quad \text{or} \quad y = c e^{2x} </me>, where <m>c</m> can be any constant. Let's prove that <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					First, compute <m>y'</m>:
					<md>
						<mrow>	y		=\amp\	c e^{2x}						</mrow>
						<mrow>	y'		=\amp\	2c e^{2x}	</mrow>
					</md>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, substitute <m>y</m> and <m>y'</m> into the differential equation:
					<md>
						<mrow> 					y' - 2y	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2(c e^{2x})	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 	2c e^{2x} - 2c e^{2x}	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
						<mrow> 						0	=\amp\ 0	</mrow>
					</md>
					<p>
						Therefore, <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is a solution, and the specific value of <m>c</m> does not matter.
					</p>
			</solution>

		</example>

		<p>
			From the above example, you can see that the function <m>y = c e^{2x}</m> satisfies the differential equation for any value of <m>c</m>. This leads to an important observation:
			<blockquote>
				<em><q>How many choices for <m>c</m> are there?</q></em>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Of course, the answer is infinitely many! This means the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m> has an infinite number of solutions. This brings us to some key terms related to solutions of differential equations.</p>

		<note><title> <em>Don't assume a function that satisfies a DE is a general solution!</em> </title>
			<p>
				A function that contains constants and satisfies a differential equation <em>does not mean it is the general solution</em> since it could be missing a term. For example, you could easily show that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x</m> is a solution to 
				<me>\quad y'' = 1</me>, 
				but you already know from <xref ref="two-constant-solution-verification"/> that <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x + c_2</m> is a solution, which is more general than <m>y = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + c_1 x</m>.
			</p>
		</note>

		<definition xml:id="types-of-solutions"><title>Types of Solutions</title>
			<statement>
				<dl>
					<li xml:id="family-of-solutions">
						<title>Family of Solutions</title>
						<p>The collection of all possible solutions of a differential equation.</p>
					</li>
					<li xml:id="general-solution">

						<title>Particular Solution</title>
						<p>A single solution obtained by assigning specific values to the constants in the general solution.</p>
					</li>
				</dl>
			</statement>
		</definition>

		<p>
			Applying these terms to our previous example, we can summarize that:
			<ul>
				<li><m>y = c e^{2x}</m> is the <em>general solution</em> of the equation <m>y' - 2y = 0</m>.</li>
				<li><m>y = 5e^{2x}</m> is one <em>particular solution</em> in the <em>family of solutions</em>.</li>
				<li>The <em>family of solutions</em> consists of all functions of the form <m>y = c e^{2x}</m>.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
			Understanding the different types of solutions—general, particular, and families of solutions—is crucial as you continue to explore differential equations. In the upcoming sections, we'll talk more about where particular solutions come from.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Visualizing Solutions </title>
		<p>
			A powerful way to understand solutions to differential equations is by visualizing them. Consider the differential equation
			<me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
			which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3</m> (<xref ref="p1-c2-s4-details-1" text="custom">solution verification details</xref>).
		</p>	

		<p>
			Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ (see <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" />).
		</p>
		
		<sidebyside widths="46% 2% 50%" margins="0%">

				</p>
				<ul marker="square">
					<li> 
						Each green curve in the figure represents a particular solution, with its own specific value of <m>c</m>.

		</sidebyside>

		<p>
			Although the figure only shows a few members of the infinite family of solutions, notice that the green curves never overlap. This means that each curve represents a unique solution. If you were to randomly select a point on the plot, you would, in effect, be selecting a single curve—only one solution can pass through that specific point. This idea is at the heart of where particular solution come from and it will be the focus of the next section.

	<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Initial Conditions &amp; Particular Solutions </title>
		<p>
			Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines all the possible solutions (family of solutions). For example, later on in this text, we will show that the differential equation
			<men xml:id="initial-condition-de">y'' - y' - 12y = 0</men>
			has the general solution
			<men xml:id="initial-condition-gen-sol">y(t) = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}.</men>
			While the general solution gives us a family of possible solutions, in practical scenarios, we are usually interested in the specific solution where the constants are known. This is where initial conditions come into play—they allow us to determine the particular solution that applies to the problem at hand.
		</p>

		<p>
			An <term>initial condition</term> is a starting value of the solution or its derivatives. For example, consider the free fall of an object due to gravity where <m>s(t)</m> is the position (distance from the ground) of this object at time <m>t</m>. Assuming the ball is dropped from the top of a 100 ft building, what initial information do you know? Let <m>t=0</m> be the time when the ball is dropped, then the initial conditions are given in the following table.
		</p>

		<p>
			The following table summarizes the initial conditions for our example, highlighting the key information required to determine the particular solution:
		</p>

		<p>
			<tabular>
				<col right="minor" halign="center"/>
				<col halign="center"/>
				<row bottom="minor">
				<cell>Information at <m>t=0</m></cell>
				<cell>Initial Condition</cell>
				</row>
				<row>
				<cell>The ball is at the top of a 100 ft building.</cell>
				<cell><m>s(0) = 100 \text{ ft}</m></cell>
				</row>
				<row>
				<cell>The ball is dropped from rest (initial velocity is zero).</cell>
				<cell><m>s'(0) = 0 \text{ ft/s}</m></cell>
				</row>
			</tabular>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Without these initial conditions, the solution is incomplete and not applicable to any specific scenario. Assuming the solution must be consistent with these conditions forces the constants in the general solution to take specific values, giving us a particular solution.

		<example>

				<solution><title>Verification as a solution</title>

					<p>
						First find <m>y, y', \text{ and } y''</m>:
						<md>

						</md>
					</p>
				
					<p>
						and substitute these into <m>y'' - y' - 12y</m> and simplify:
						<md>
							<mrow>
								y'' - y' - 12y =\amp\ \left(9c_1e^{-3t} + 16c_2e^{4t}\right)

							<mrow>

						</md>
						Which shows <m>0 = 0</m> and so <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m> is a solution.
					</p>
			</solution>

				<p>
					We would like determine the spcific values of <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m> that correspond to the initial conditions <m>y(0) = 4</m> and <m>y'(0) = -2</m>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Since one initial condition involves the derivative, we will need to compute this before applying this condition.
					<me>y' = -3c_1e^{-3t} + 4c_2e^{4t}.</me>
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Now let's apply the initial conditions:

					<mrow>			\amp	\amp	-5	=\amp\ -3c_1 + 4c_2	</mrow>

					The initial condition, <m>y(0) = 2</m>, tells us that <q><m>y</m> must equal 2 when <m>x</m> is 0</q>. When we substitute <m>y=2</m> and <m>x=0</m> into the general solution, we see that we can solve for <m>c</m>.

			In summary, the process of solving a differential equation typically begins with finding a general solution. However, to apply this solution to real-world problems, we rely on initial conditions to determine a particular solution that accurately represents the system's specific circumstances.

					Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the general solution of a differential equation.
				</p>
				<answer>
					<line>
						The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the
						solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the
						constants in the general solution.
						</line>
						<line>
						Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the
						family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a
						single particular solution.

				<introduction>
					<p>
						We spend a lot of time solving equations, but do you even remember what it means to be a solution? Let's review what it means to be a solution to an algebraic equation (as in question <xref ref="alg_eqn_soln"/>), and then what it means to be a solution to a differential equation (as in question <xref ref="diff_eqn_soln"/>), and then we'll extend those ideas in questions <xref ref="soln_form1"/> and <xref ref="soln_form2"/>.
					</p>
				</introduction>

				<exercise>
					<p>
						Verify that <m>x = 3</m> is a solution to the equation 
						
						<men xml:id="alg_eqn_soln">2x^2 + 3 = 7x.</men>
					
					</p>
				
					<p>
						What confirms that <m>x = 3</m> is a solution? 
						<answer>
						the LHS = RHS after substituting <m>x = 3</m> into both sides of the equation.
						</answer>	
					</p>
				
					<p>	
						(<em> Note: Do not rearrange the equation to solve for <m>x</m>. That would be the
						process of finding a solution; you are asked to verify a solution.</em>)
					</p>

					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
					We substitute <m>x = 3</m> into the left hand side (LHS) of the equation, 
						and then into the right hand side (RHS) of the equation:
						
						<md>
							<mrow>\text{LHS}	=\amp\ 2x^2 + 3										</mrow>
							<mrow>				=\amp\ 2(3)^2 + 3									</mrow>
							<mrow>				=\amp\ 18 + 3										</mrow>

							<mrow>				\amp 												</mrow>
							<mrow>\text{RHS}	=\amp\ 7x											</mrow>
							<mrow>				=\amp\ 7(3)											</mrow>
							<mrow>				=\amp\ 21											</mrow>	
						</md>
						
						Since we get the same result when we substitute the solution into the RHS and 
						into the LHS, we have confirmed that <m>x = 3</m> is a solution to the equation.
						</p>
					</solution>

					<answer>
						Since we get the same result (21) when we substitute the solution into the 
						RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that <m>x = 3</m> is a solution to the equation.
					</answer>

				<exercise>
					<p>
						Verify that <m>y = c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x</m> is a solution to the DE 
						<men xml:id="diff_eqn_soln">\ds \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y = 0.</men>
					</p>
					
					<hint>
						Look back at the previous question and think about what it means to be a solution to a DE.
					</hint>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
					We need to substitute into the DE. In order to substitute into the left hand side, we need to know the second derivative. So we begin by finding that.
						
						<md>
						<mrow>						y	=\amp\ c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x			</mrow>
						<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y'	=\amp\ c_1 \cos x - c_2 \sin x			</mrow>
						<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y''	=\amp\ -c_1 \sin x - c_2 \cos x			</mrow>	
						</md>
						
						Now we can substitute into the DE:
						
						<md>
						<mrow>\text{LHS}=\amp\ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y								</mrow>
						<mrow>			=\amp\ \Big[ -c_1 \sin x - c_2 \cos x \Big] 
								+ \Big[ c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x \Big]		</mrow>
						<mrow>			=\amp\ 0													</mrow>
						<mrow>			=\amp\ \text{RHS}										</mrow>	
						</md>
						
						Since when we substitute in to the DE, we find that the LHS is equal to the RHS, we have verified that <m>y = c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x</m> is a solution to the DE <m>\ds \frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + y = 0.</m>
						</p>
					</solution>

					<answer>
						Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that <m>y = c_1 \sin x + c_2 \cos x</m> is a solution to the DE.
					</answer>

				<exercise> 
					<p>
						Consider the DE

						Find all values of <m>m</m> such that <m>y = e^{mx}</m> is a solution to the DE by taking derivatives and substituting into the DE, and then solving for <m>m</m>.
					</p>
						
					<hint>
						<m>e^{mx} \ne 0,</m> no matter the value of <m>x</m> or <m>m.</m> Therefore we might want to factor it out as it won't contribute to our answer.
					</hint>
					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
					First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE.
						<md>
						<mrow>						y	=\amp\ e^{mx}							</mrow>
						<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y'	=\amp\ me^{mx}							</mrow>
						<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y''	=\amp\ m^2 e^{mx}						</mrow>	
						</md> 
						Now we can substitute into the DE and solve for <m>m</m>:
						<md>
						<mrow>\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} 
							+ 6 \frac{dy}{dx} + 5y	=\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow>\Big[ m^2 e^{mx} \Big] + 6\Big[ m e^{mx} \Big] 
							+ 5\Big[ e^{mx} \Big]	=\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow>	e^{mx} \Big[ m^2 + 6m + 5 Big]	=\amp\ 0							</mrow>
						<mrow>				e^{mx} (m+5)(m+1)	=\amp\ 0							</mrow>	
						</md>
						Recall that <m>e^{mx} \ne 0,</m> no matter the value of <m>x</m> or <m>m.</m>
						Thus we have:
						<md>
						<mrow>	m+5 = 0 \amp \text{ or } m+1 = 0								</mrow>
						<mrow>	m = -5,	\amp \text{ or } m = -1									</mrow>	
						</md>
						So the two solutions are <m>m = -5, -1.</m>

						</p>
					</solution>

					<answer>
						<me> m = -5, -1 </me>
					</answer>

				</exercise>

				<exercise>
					<p>
						Now that you have (hopefully!) two values for <m>m,</m> choose one of the two values and then verify that <m>y = e^{mx}</m> is a solution for that value of <m>m.</m>
					</p>

					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
						The work here is for <m>m = -5,</m> and the work for <m>m = -1</m> is similar.
						</p>
						<p>
						First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE.
						<md>
							<mrow>							y	=\amp\ e^{-5x}						</mrow>
							<mrow>		\Rightarrow \quad   y'	=\amp\ -5e^{-5x}						</mrow>
							<mrow>		\Rightarrow \quad 	y''	=\amp\ 25 e^{-5x}					</mrow>	
						</md> 	
						Now we can substitute into the DE:
						<md>
							<mrow>\text{LHS}=\amp\ \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 6 \frac{dy}{dx} + 5y			</mrow>
							<mrow>			=\amp\ \Big[ 25e^{-5x} \Big] + 6\Big[ -5e^{-5x} \Big] 
									+ 5\Big[ e^{-5x} \Big]		</mrow>
							<mrow>			=\amp\ 25e^{-5x} - 30 e^{-5x} + 5e^{-5x}					</mrow>
							<mrow>			=\amp\ 0													</mrow>
							<mrow>			=\amp\ \text{RHS}										</mrow>	
						</md>
						Hence, we have shown that <m>y = e^{-5x}</m> is a solution to the DE 
						<m>\ds  \frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 6 \frac{dy}{dx} + 5y = 0.</m>
						</p>
					</solution>

					<answer>
						Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that <m>y = e^{-5x}</m> (or <m>y = e^{-x}</m>) is a solution to the DE.

					</p>

					<solution><title> Solution </title>
						<p>
						We proceed as in the previous question. First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE.
						<md>

							<mrow>	\Rightarrow \quad   y''	=\amp\ m(m-1)x^{m-2}						</mrow>	
						</md> 
						Now we can substitute into the DE:

							<mrow>				3x^2 \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}	=\amp\ 
								-11x \frac{dy}{dx} + 3y						</mrow>
							<mrow>		3x^2\Big[ m(m-1)x^{m-2} \Big]	=\amp\

						Note that there is no value of <m>m</m> that can guarantee that <m>x^m</m> is 0.
