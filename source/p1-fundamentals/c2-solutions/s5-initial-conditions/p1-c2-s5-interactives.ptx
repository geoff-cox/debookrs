                <statement>The starting point of the independent variable.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. The initial condition is related to the solution or its derivatives at a specific point.</feedback>
            </choice>
            <choice correct="yes">
                <statement>The starting value of the solution or its derivatives.</statement>
                <feedback>Correct! An initial condition specifies the value of the solution or its derivative at a particular point.</feedback>

                <statement>The final value of the solution.</statement>

                <statement>The point where the solution intersects the x-axis.</statement>
                <feedback>Incorrect. The initial condition is about the value at a specific point, not necessarily where it intersects the x-axis.</feedback>
