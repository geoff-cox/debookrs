			Verify that <m>\ds y = Ce^{x^2} + 3</m>, where <m>C</m> is any constant, is a solution to the DE

			<p>
				We'll approach this the same way we approached the algebraic equation in the example above: we will to substitute the function <m>\ds y = Ce^{x^2} + 3</m> in on the left and right hand sides of the equation

				Since both the <m>LHS</m> and <m>RHS</m> turn out to be	<m>2Cxe^{x^2}</m>, we have shown that <m>\ds y = Ce^{x^2} + 3</m> satisfies and is, thus, a	solution to	<m>\ds \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x.</m>

	<note><title>Example Notes</title>
	
		<p>
			Since we used a generic constant <m>C</m>, we have shown that <m>\ds y = Ce^{x^2} + 3</m> is a solution for any value we like for the constant <m>C</m>. In particular,
			<ul>
			<li>for <m>C=-41, \quad y = -41e^{x^2} + 3 \quad</m> is a solution.</li>
			<li>for <m>C=199, \quad y = 199e^{x^2} + 3 \quad</m> is a solution.</li>
			<li>for <m>C=0, \quad y = 3 \quad</m> is a solution.</li>
			</ul>
			Since there is no limit to what <m>C</m> we can choose, this DE must have an infinite number of solutions. In the next section, we will describe this idea further.

	<p>
		A powerful way to understand solutions to differential equations is by visualizing them. Consider the differential equation
        <me> \frac{dy}{dx} = 2xy - 6x </me>,
		which has the general solution, <m> y = ce^{x^2} + 3. </m>
	</p>  

	<p>
		Since each member of the family of solutions comes from a different value of <m>c</m>, we can plot a few of them to see how they differ (see <xref ref="family-of-solutions-figure-1" />).

				<li>

	<p>
		Although the figure only shows a few members of the infinite family of solutions, notice that the green curves never overlap. This means that each curve represents a unique solution. If you were to randomly select a point on the plot, you would, in effect, be selecting a single curveâ€”only one solution can pass through that specific point. This idea is at the heart of where particular solution come from and it will be the focus of the next section.
