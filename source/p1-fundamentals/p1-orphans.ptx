		<p>
			In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = <m>I</m>, and time = <m>t</m>.  For this discussion, let's assume time is in days.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since the number of infected, <m>I</m>, changes according to how much time, <m>t</m>, has	passed, then <m>I</m> depends on <m>t</m>. Therefore, <m>I</m> would the dependent variable and <m>t</m> would be the independent variable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be
			<me>I(t) = \text{some function of } t</me>.
			Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time.  Now, let's say we have the solution, <m>I</m>, plug <m>t=10</m>	into it, and see the following:
			<me> I(10) = 30. </me>
			This result would be interpreted as "after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected".
		</p>
	
	
		<p>
			Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>What is one value for the number of infected we should know?</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we	know
			<me>I(0) = 12</me>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any information about the initial value of a dependent variable is referred to as an <term> initial condition. </term>
		</p>

		<exercise>
		
			<statement>
			<p>
				Referring to the 2nd bullet point above, if you use initial conditions to find the constants of the general solution, then we can reasonably state that
				<sidebyside width="90%">
				<p>
					Initial conditions find a <m>\ul{\phantom{particular solution}}</m> from the general solution (or family of solutions).
				</p>
				</sidebyside>
			</p>
			</statement>
		
			<answer> particular solution </answer>
		
		</exercise>

		<p>
			To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points of the previous section that will be useful in this section.
			<ul>
			<li>
				The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.
			</li>
			<li>
				All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of possible solutions we called a family of solutions.
			</li>
			<li>
				Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.
			</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<remark xml:id="sect-01-04-01-remark-01">
			<p>
			Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is equal to the order of the differential equation<m>^{1}</m>.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is illustrated in ? since <m>y'' - y' - 12y = 0</m> is of 2nd order and the general solution, <m>y = c_1e^{-3t} + c_2e^{4t}</m>, has 2 constants, <m>c_1</m> and <m>c_2</m>.
