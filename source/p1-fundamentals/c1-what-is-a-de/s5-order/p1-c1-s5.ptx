	<p>
		In this section, we'll explore a key concept in differential equations known as <term>order</term>. Think of the order of a differential equation as the number of layers or steps you need to peel away to reveal the original function. The more layers there are, the higher the order, and usually, the more complex the equation.

	<definition xml:id="def-order">
		<statement>The <term>order</term> of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative that appears in the equation. For example, if the highest derivative is the first derivative, it's called a <em>first-order</em> differential equation. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, it's called a <em>second-order</em> differential equation, and so on.</statement>
	</definition>
	
	<example><title> <em>Identify the Order</em> </title>

		<solution><title> <m>\ds \frac{dy}{dx} + y = x</m> </title>
			<p>
				<term>Order = 1.</term> This is a <em>first-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\ds\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>

		<solution><title> <m>\ds x^2 y'' + y''' = \sin(x) + y^8</m> </title>
			<p>
				<term>Order = 3</term>. This is a <em>third-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>y'''</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>

		<solution><title> <m>\ds \frac{d^2 A}{dt^2} + \frac{dA}{dt} + A = 17</m> </title>
			<p>
				<term>Order = 2</term> This is a <em>second-order</em> differential equation because the highest derivative is <m>\ds\frac{d^2 A}{dt^2}</m>.
			</p>
		</solution>
		
	</example>

	<note><title>Caution, Don't Confuse Exponents with Derivatives</title>
		<p>
			It's important to distinguish between exponents and derivatives. For example, in the second example, <m>y^8</m> indicates that the dependent variable is raised to the 8th power, but this is not related to the order of the differential equation.
