	<p>
		In this section, we'll explore the two types of variables found in differential equations: dependent and independent variables. Understanding the roles of these variables is crucial when solving and interpreting differential equations.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Consider the differential equation:
		<men xml:id="variables-de-1">
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 3x^2.
		</men>
		This equation involves two variables: <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>. One of these variables is the unknown that we are trying to solve for, but which one?
	</p>

	<p>
		Typically, the variable you want to solve for is the one with a derivative applied to it. Here, the term <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m> in <xref ref="variables-de-1" /> indicates:
		<ol>
			<li><p>The derivative is being taken with respect to <m>x</m>, and</p></li>
			<li><p><m>y</m> is a function of <m>x</m> (since it wouldn't make sense to take the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m> unless <m>y</m> depends on <m>x</m>).</p></li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<p>
		Therefore, <m>y</m> is called the <em>dependent variable</em> because it depends on <m>x</m>. On the other hand, <m>x</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.
	</p>

		<statement>
			<dl>
				<li xml:id="def-dependent-variable"><title>Dependent Variable:</title>
					<p>
						The variable representing the unknown function we are trying to find. It is always the variable with a derivative applied to it.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="def-independent-variable"><title>Independent Variable:</title>
					<p>
						The variable that the dependent variable is a function of. It does not have a derivative applied to it.
					</p>
				</li>

		<m>\ \ </m>Identify the dependent and independent variables in each equation and state which variable represents the unknown.

						Since the derivative <m>\ds\frac{dP}{ds}</m> appears, it implies that:
							<ul>
								<li><m>P</m> is a function of <m>s</m> and is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
								<li><m>s</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
								<li><m>P(s)</m> represents the <em>unknown</em> to this differential equation.</li>

						<solution><title> Solution </title>
							<p>
								The second derivative <m>u''</m> suggests that:
								<ul>
									<li><m>u</m> is a function of <m>t</m> and is the <em>dependent variable</em>.</li>
									<li><m>t</m> is the <em>independent variable</em>.</li>
									<li><m>u(t)</m> represents the <em>unknown</em> to this differential equation.</li>

						<m>\hspace{27em}</m>
						<solution><title> Solution </title>
							<p>
								Here, <m>Q''</m> implies that <m>Q</m> is the <em>dependent variable</em>. Since no independent variable is explicitly shown, typically the context of the problem would provide it. If not, we can assume it ourselvesâ€”perhaps <m>t</m>, making <m>Q(t)</m> the <em>unknown</em>.
