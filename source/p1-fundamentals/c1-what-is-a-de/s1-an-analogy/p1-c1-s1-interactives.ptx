			<p><em>Which of the following best describes a differential equation?</em></p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						An equation involving only algebraic expressions.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>
						Incorrect. A differential equation involves derivatives.
					</p>
				</feedback>

			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>
					<p>
						An equation involving functions and their derivatives.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>
						Correct! A differential equation involves functions and their derivatives.
					</p>

			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						An equation involving trigonometric functions.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>
						Incorrect. A differential equation could involve trigonometric functions, but it is not a defining characteristic.
					</p>
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						An equation that changes over time.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					<p>

				<em>What distinguishes a differential equation from a standard equation?</em>
			</p>
		</statement>
		<choices>
			<choice>
				<statement>
					<p>
						It contains an unknown variable.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					Incorrect. Both standard and differential equations contain unknown variables.
				</feedback>
			</choice>
			<choice correct="yes">
				<statement>
					<p>
						It contains a derivative.
					</p>
				</statement>
				<feedback>
					Correct! A differential equation contains one or more derivatives, which differentiates it from a standard equation.
				</feedback>
