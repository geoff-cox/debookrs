		To begin our exploration of the Laplace Transform, we start with the first step in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace Transform Roadmap</xref>, known as the forward Laplace transform. This step is foundational, as it sets the stage for the subsequent transformations outlined in the roadmap.

		Applying the forward Laplace transform to a differential equation involves converting both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation into their Laplace-transformed counterparts.

		This section investigates how individual functions, like <m>-40e^{3t}</m> in step 1, are transformed into expressions such as <m>-\frac{40}{s-3}</m>. In the next section, we will show where the <m>s^2Y + 3sY + 2Y + 9</m> comes from in the forward transform.
