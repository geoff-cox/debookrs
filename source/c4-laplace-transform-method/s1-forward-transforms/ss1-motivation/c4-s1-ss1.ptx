		The power of the Laplace transform comes from combination of integration by parts and the derivative properties of exponential functions. To explain, recall the integration by parts formula, commonly given by
		<me> 
			\int u\ dv = uv - \int v\ du 
		</me>.
		If <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m>, then <m>dv=v'\, dt</m> and <m>du=u'\, dt</m>, and the formula can be written as
		<me> 
			\ub{\int u v'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }v} = u v - \ub{\int v u'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }u}
		</me>.
		Notice that on the left, the derivative is applied to <m>v</m>, but on the right, it is applied to <m>u</m>. Therefore, the integration by parts formula provides a way move derivatives from one function to another inside an integral.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's practice this in the integral
		<me> 
			\int e^{-st} y' dt
		</me>,
		by letting <m>u = e^{-st}</m> and <m>dv = y' dt</m> in the integration by parts formula, giving us
		<me> 
			\int \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y'}}}} \ 
			\us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y' dt}}} = 
			\us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y}}}} \
			\us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} - \int 
			\us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} \ 
			\us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{(-s e^{-st} \ dt \vphantom{y})}}}
		</me>.
		Comparing the integrals on the left and right, you can see that the derivative in the left integral got moved onto <m>e^{-st}</m>, producing an extra <m>-s</m> in the right integral. The most important thing to note is that the derivative <m>y'</m> no longer appears on the right side. This is the key idea behind the Laplace transform.
	</p>

	<p>
		Generally speaking, applying a Laplace transform to an equation amounts to multiplying both sides of it by <m>e^{-st}</m> and then integrating each side with respect to <m>t</m>. In terms of our model equation, this looks like 
		<md>
			<mrow> 
				e^{-st} \left( y'' + 3y' + 2y \right) =\amp\ e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right)
			</mrow>
			<mrow> 
				\int e^{-st} \left( y'' + 3y' + 2y \right) \ dt =\amp\ \int e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right) \ dt
			</mrow>
			<mrow> 
				\int e^{-st} y'' \ dt + 3 \int e^{-st} y' \ dt + 2 \int e^{-st} y \ dt =\amp\ \int e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right) \ dt
			</mrow>
		</md>.
		Then integration by parts moves the derivatives on the left-side onto <m>e^{-st}</m>. This initial step paves the way toward a process that allows you to recover the solution, <m>y</m>. In the next few sections, we will explore this process in more detail and see how it can be used to solve differential equations.
