<part><title> Laplace Transform Method </title> 
	<introduction>
		<p>
			Solving an algebraic equation often involves isolating the unknown variable. However, in differential equations, the unknown is entangled within derivatives, making isolation more challenging. The Laplace Transform offers a powerful technique to temporarily reframe the equation, effectively <q>unwrapping</q> the derivatives and enabling a more straightforward isolation of the unknown, similar to algebra.
		</p>

		<p>
			By applying the Laplace Transform, the dependent variable is extracted from its derivatives and embedded within a special integral. This integral serves as a <q>container</q> that encapsulates the unknown function we seek. In this transformed state, these containers can be manipulated algebraically, allowing us to isolate the unknown function within. Once isolated, we can then revert the transform, releasing the function and revealing the solution.
		</p>

		<p>
			In essence, the Laplace Transform alters the mathematical landscape of a differential equation, simplifying the process of solving for the unknown function. This method is particularly powerful for tackling linear non-constant coefficient (LNCC) equations with discontinuous right-hand side functions.

				To begin our exploration of the Laplace Transform, we start with the first step in the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace Transform Roadmap</xref>, known as the forward Laplace transform.

				Applying the forward Laplace transform to a differential equation involves converting both the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the equation into their Laplace-transformed counterparts.

		<subsection><title> Introduction </title>
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Differential equations are often difficult to solve because they involve unknown functions entangled with their derivatives. This complexity grows when the equation involves discontinuities or initial conditions. The Laplace Transform simplifies this process by converting the differential equation into an algebraic form, making it easier to solve. One of the key motivations for using the Laplace Transform is its ability to handle these discontinuities seamlessly, transforming functions piecewise into a single, continuous function in the complex plane. Through this, we can solve problems that would otherwise be very challenging with traditional methods.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> Motivation </title>
				<p>
					The Laplace transform is a powerful tool for solving differential equations by exploiting integration by parts and the properties of exponential functions. Before we dive into the details, let's recall the basic formula for integration by parts:
					<me>\int u\ dv = uv - \int v\ du</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					In this equation, <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> are functions of <m>t</m>. So <m>dv = v' \, dt</m>, and <m>du = u' \, dt</m>. Now, we can rewrite this formula as:
					<me> 
						\ub{\int u v'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }v} = u v - \ub{\int v u'\, dt}_{\text{derivative on }u}
					</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Notice how the derivative initially applied to <m>v</m> on the left-hand side shifts over to <m>u</m> on the right-hand side. This ability to transfer derivatives between functions within an integral forms the core idea behind the Laplace transform.
				</p>

				<p>
					Let's see this concept in action. Consider an integral of the form:
					<me>\int e^{-st} y' \, dt</me>,
					where <m>s</m> is a constant. By setting <m>u = e^{-st}</m> and <m>dv = y' \, dt</m> in our integration by parts formula, we get:
					<me> 
						\os{\quad (1)}{\int \us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y'}}}} \ \us{dv}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y' dt}}}} = 
						\us{u}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{e^{-st}\vphantom{y}}}} \ \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} - 
						\os{(2)}{\int \us{v}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{y}}} \ \us{du}{\us{\uparrow}{\ul{(-s e^{-st} \ dt \vphantom{y})}}}} =
						e^{-st} \, y + s \os{\quad (3)}{\int e^{-st} \, y \, dt}
					</me>.
				</p>

				<p>
					What's happening here? The derivative on <m>y'</m> in integral <m>(1)</m> is effectively transferred to the exponential function <m>e^{-st}</m> in integral <m>(2)</m>, leaving an extra factor of <m>s</m> next to integral <m>(3)</m>. 
				</p>

				<p>
					This process of transferring derivatives between functions is a reoccuring theme in the Laplace transform method and in the coming sections, we will uncover how it uses this idea to solve a wide range of differential equations.

			<subsubsection><title> Definition </title>
				<p>
					In the previous section, we mentioned the importance of integration by parts and <m>e^{-st}</m> to the Laplace transform process. To perform a Laplace transform is to multiply both sides of an equation by <m>e^{-st}</m> and integrate with respect to <m>t</m>. For instance, applying this process to the equation 
					<me>
						e^{-st} \left( y'' + 3y' + 2y \right) = -40e^{3t}
					</me>
					would look like this:
					<md>
						<mrow> 
							e^{-st} \left( y'' + 3y' + 2y \right) 
								=\amp\ e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right)
						</mrow>
						<mrow> 
							\int e^{-st} \left( y'' + 3y' + 2y \right) \, dt 
								=\amp\ \int e^{-st} \left( -40e^{3t} \right) \, dt
						</mrow>
						<mrow> 
							\ub{\int e^{-st} {\color{blue} y''} \, dt}_{\text{transform of } {\color{blue} y''}} + 
							3\ub{\int e^{-st} {\color{blue} y'} \, dt}_{\text{transform of } {\color{blue} y'}} + 
							2\ub{\int e^{-st} {\color{blue} y} \, dt}_{\text{transform of } {\color{blue} y}} 
								=\amp\ \ub{\int e^{-st} \left( {\color{blue} -40e^{3t}} \right) \, dt}_{\text{transform of } {\color{blue} -40e^{3t}}}
						</mrow>
					</md>.
					As this shows, applying the transform to the equation amounts to applying it to each term of our original equation (in blue). The following definition of the Laplace transform makes this more precise.
				</p>

				<definition><title>Laplace Transform</title>
					<statement>
						The <term>Laplace Transform</term> of a given function <m>f(t)</m> is defined as

						<me> \lap{ {\color{blue} f(t)} } = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} {\color{blue} f(t)}\ dt,</me>

						provided that the integral exists (i.e., the improper integral converges).
					</statement>
				</definition>

				<p>
					This definition may appear daunting at first glance, but let's break it down. The <m>\infty</m> in the upper limit signals that we are dealing with an improper integral. In calculus, we learned that improper integrals can be understood as limits. Specifically:
				</p>
				
				<me>
					\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\, dt = \ub{\lim_{b \to \infty} \ob{\int_0^b e^{-st} f(t)\, dt}^{\text{step 1: compute the integral}}}_{\text{step 2: compute the limit}}
				</me>
				
				<p>
					Notice that while the integral involves both <m>s</m> and <m>t</m>, the integration is performed with respect to <m>t</m>. If you're unfamiliar with handling multiple variables like this, simply treat <m>s</m> as a constant during the integration process. Now, let's walk through an example to see this concept in action.

		<subsection><title> Common Transforms </title>
			<introduction>
				<p>
					In this section, we will explore some of the most commonly encountered Laplace transforms. These functions frequently appear in differential equations, making their transforms especially valuable tools for solving such equations. Let's start with the Laplace transform of the exponential function, <m>e^{at}</m>, and gradually build up to more complex functions like power functions, sine, and cosine.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> Constant Function, <m>1</m> </title>
				<example>
					<m>\ \ </m>Compute <m>\ds \lap{1}</m>.

					<solution>
						<p>
							By the definition above, we have the improper integral
							<men xml:id="lt-1-example-eqn-1"> 
								\lap{1} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot 1\ dt = \lim_{b \to \infty} \ub{\int_0^b e^{-st}dt}_{I}
							</men>.
							To evaluate this, we treat <m>s</m> as a constant and integrate with respect to <m>t</m>.
							<md>
								<mrow>				
									I = \int_0^b e^{-st}dt
									=\amp\ -\frac{1}{s}e^{-st}\Big|_{t=0}^{t=b}
								</mrow>
								<mrow>			
									=\amp\ -\frac{1}{s}\left[ e^{-sb} - e^{-s\cdot 0} \right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>			
									=\amp\ -\frac{1}{s}\left[ e^{-sb} - 1 \right]
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Now that we have <m>I</m>, we can plug it into the limit above.
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lim_{b \to \infty} -\frac{1}{s}\left[ e^{-sb} - 1 \right]
									=\amp\ -\frac{1}{s} \lim_{b \to \infty} \Big[ e^{-sb} - 1 \Big] 
									\qquad \leftarrow <xref text="custom" ref="reason-factor-out-s">why?</xref>
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp\ -\frac{1}{s} \Big[ \ub{\lim_{b \to \infty} e^{-sb}}_{L} - \us{=\ 1}{\ub{\lim_{b \to \infty} 1}} \Big] 
								</mrow>
							</md>
						</p>
				
						<p>
							The value of the remaining limit, <m>L</m>, depends on whether <m>s</m> is positive or negative. So we consider both cases:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p>
										<line><m>s &lt; 0:\ </m> Since <m>\ds e^{-(\text{negative})b} = e^{(\text{positive})b} \to \infty</m> as <m>b \to \infty</m></line>
										<line><m>\hspace{4.0em} \implies\ </m> limit diverges (does not exist) when <m>s &lt; 0</m>.</line>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										<line><m>s &gt; 0:\ </m> Since <m>\ds e^{-(\text{positive})b} = e^{(\text{negative})b} \to 0</m> as <m>b \to \infty</m></line>
										<line><m>\hspace{4.0em} \implies\ </m> limit converges (exists) when <m>s &gt; 0</m>.</line>
									</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							To visualize this, here is a <xref ref="compare-exp-graphs" text="custom">graph</xref> comparing <m>s=-1.2\ </m> versus <m>\, +1.2</m>.
						</p>
				
						<p>
							Therefore, when <m>s &gt; 0</m> the Laplace transform exists and evaluates to
							<me>\lap{1} = -\frac{1}{s} [0 - 1] = \frac{1}{s} \quad \text{for } s \gt 0.</me>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>

				<p>
					Now that we've worked through an example, here are a few key takeaways:
				</p>
				
				<ul marker="square">
					<li>
					<p>
						The Laplace transform always results in a function of <m>s</m>. We typically denote the Laplace transform of <m>f(t)</m> as <m>F(s)</m>. For instance,
						<me> \lap{f(t)} = F(s) \quad \text{or} \quad \lap{q(t)} = Q(s).</me>
					</p>
					</li>
				
					<li>
					<p>
						The values of <m>s</m> for which the integral converges are crucial. While these values usually don't affect the solution to the differential equation, we will make a habit of noting them as we build our Laplace transform toolbox.
					</p>
					</li>
				
					<li>
					<p>
						The notation <m>\lap{}</m> includes curly braces to indicate the function being transformed. These braces are essential, not optional.
					</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>
					With this, we've introduced our first Laplace transform. In the next section, we will explore a collection of common transforms that are used to solve differential equations.

					<m>\ \ </m> Compute <m> \lap{ e^{7t}} </m>.
			
					<solution>
						<p>
							We begin by applying the definition of the Laplace transform:
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{ e^{7t} } 
									=\amp\ \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot e^{7t}\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
									=\amp\ \lim_{b \to \infty}\int_0^b e^{(-s+7)t}\ dt
								</mrow>
							</md>
							For this improper integral to converge, the exponent <m>-s+7</m> must be negative, meaning:
							<me> 
								-s+7 \lt 0 \hspace{0.5cm}\Rightarrow \hspace{0.5cm} -s \lt -7 \hspace{0.5cm}\Rightarrow \hspace{0.5cm} s \gt 7
							</me>.
							Thus, we proceed under the assumption that <m>s \gt 7</m>.
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{ e^{7t} } 
										=\amp\ \lim_{b \to \infty}\int_0^b e^{(-s+7)t}\, dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp\ \lim_{b \to \infty} \frac{1}{7-s} e^{(-s+7)t} \Bigg|_0^b
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp\ \frac{1}{-s+7} \left[ \lim_{b \to \infty} \left( e^{(-s+7)b} - e^{0} \right) \right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp\ \frac{1}{-s+7} \left[ \lim_{b \to \infty} e^{(-s+7)b} - 1 \right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
										=\amp\ \frac{1}{-s+7} \left[ 0 - 1 \right] \qquad \Big(e^{(\text{negative})b} \to 0\Big)
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
										=\amp\ -\frac{1}{-s+7} = \frac{1}{s-7}. \quad \text{for } s \gt 7
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Thus, the Laplace transform of <m>e^{7t}</m> is:

			<subsubsection><title> Power Function, <m>t^{n}</m> </title>
				<p>
					The power function <m>t^n</m> is another common function type found in differential equations. The Laplace transform of <m>t^n</m> follows a recursive pattern, which simplifies the computation for higher powers. We've already seen that <m>\ds\lap{1} = \sfrac{1}{s}</m>. Now, let's compute the transforms for <m>t</m> and <m>t^2</m>.
				</p>

				<example>

					<p>
						The Laplace transforms for <m>t</m> and <m>t^2</m> are as follows:
						<ul marker="square">
							<li>	
								<m> \ds \lap{t} 	= \frac{1}{s^2}, \quad s \gt 0 \quad </m> <xref ref="laplace-transform-of-t-power-1" text="custom">Details</xref>
							</li>
							<li>	
								<m> \ds \lap{t^2} = \frac{2}{s^3}, \quad s \gt 0 \quad </m> <xref ref="laplace-transform-of-t-power-2" text="custom">Details</xref>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
				</example>

				<p>
					If you look in each solution, before computing <m>L = 0</m>, you'll notice a relationship between the Laplace transforms of powers that differ by one. Namely,
					<me>
						\lap{t} = \frac{1}{s}\lap{1} \quad \text{and} \quad \lap{t^2} = \frac{2}{s}\lap{t}
					</me>,
					and if you compute the Laplace transform of <m>t^3</m>, you'll find that
					<me>
						\lap{t^3} = \frac{3}{s}\lap{t^2}
					</me>.
					In general, this recursive pattern continues for any power <m>n</m> as
					<me>
						\lap{t^n} = \frac{n}{s}\lap{t^{n-1}}
					</me>.
					So if we wanted the Laplace transform of <m>t^4</m>, we could find it like so
					<md>
						<mrow> 
							\lap{t^4}
								=\amp\ \frac{4}{s}\lap{t^3}
						</mrow>
						<mrow> 				
								=\amp\ \frac{4}{s}\left[\frac{3}{s}\lap{t^2}\right] 
								= \frac{4\cdot 3}{s^2}\left[\frac{2}{s}\lap{t}\right] 
								= \frac{4\cdot 3\cdot 2}{s^3}\cdot\frac{1}{s^2} 
								= \ob{\frac{4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1}{s^5}}^{\text{factorial}}
						</mrow>
					</md>.
					This pattern is true for higher powers of <m>t</m>, leading to the next laplace transform rule which makes use of the <xref ref="factorial" text="title"/>.

			<subsubsection><title> Sine and Cosine, <m>\sin(bt),\ \cos(bt)</m> </title>
				<p>
					Now, let's turn to the Laplace transforms of trigonometric functions, which frequently arise in systems involving oscillations or wave equations.
				</p>

				<example>
			
					<m>\ \ </m>Compute <m>\lap{\cos(3t)}</m>.
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							We start by applying the definition of the Laplace transform:
							<me>
								\lap{ \cos(3t)} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot \cos(3t)\ dt 
							</me>.
							Rather than directly integrating, we will use a modified <xref ref="eulers-formula" text="title"></xref> to express cosine in terms of <m>e</m>
							<me>
								\cos(3t) = \frac12\left(e^{3it} + e^{-3it}\right).
							</me>
							Substituting this into the integral gives:
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{ \cos(3t)} 
									=\amp\ \frac12 \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \frac12\left(e^{3it} + e^{-3it}\right)\ dt 
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \frac12\left[\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st}\cdot e^{3it}\ dt + \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st}\cdot e^{-3it}\ dt\right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \frac{1}{2} \left[\lap{e^{3it}} + \lap{e^{-3it}}\right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{1}{s - 3i} + \frac{1}{s + 3i}\right] \qquad (\text{by } <xref ref="L2" text="title"/>)
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{s + 3i + s - 3i}{(s - 3i)(s + 3i)}\right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \frac{s}{s^2 + 9}.
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Therefore, the Laplace transform of <m>\cos(3t)</m> is:
							<me>
								\lap{\cos(3t)} = \frac{s}{s^2 + 9}.
							</me>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>

				<p>
					The sine function is handled in a similar way, as the next example shows.
				</p>

				<example>

					<m>\ \ </m>Compute <m>\lap{\sin(-4t)}</m>.
				
					<solution>
						<p>
							As with cosine, we begin with the definition of the Laplace transform,
							<me>
								\lap{ \sin(-4t)} = \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot \sin(-4t)\ dt
							</me>
							and rewrite sine using Euler's formula,
							<me>
								\sin(-4t) = \frac{e^{-4it} - e^{4it}}{2i}.
							</me>
							Substituting this into the integral, we get:
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{ \sin(-4t)} 
									=\amp \frac{1}{2i} \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \left(e^{-4it} - e^{4it}\right)\, dt 
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp \frac{1}{2i} \left[\int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s + 4i)t}\, dt - \int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s - 4i)t}\, dt\right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp \frac{1}{2i} \left[\lap{e^{-4it}} - \lap{e^{4it}}\right].
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp \frac{1}{2i} \left[\frac{1}{s + 4i} - \frac{1}{s - 4i}\right] \qquad (\text{by } <xref ref="L2" text="title"/>)
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp \frac{1}{2i} \left[\frac{s - 4i - (s + 4i)}{(s + 4i)(s - 4i)}\right]
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp \frac{4}{s^2 + 16}.
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Thus, the Laplace transform of <m>\sin(-4t)</m> is:
							<me>
								\lap{\sin(-4t)} = \frac{4}{s^2 + 16}.
							</me>
						</p>
					</solution>

		<subsection><title> Properties of Laplace Transforms </title>
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Now that we've explored individual Laplace transforms, its time to delve into some of the key properties that make the Laplace transform such a powerful tool for solving differential equations. These properties allow us to manipulate and combine transforms in ways that simplify complex problems.
				</p>
			</introduction>
			
			<subsubsection><title> Linearity of the Laplace Transform </title>
				<p>
					The first property we'll explore is linearity. This property is foundational because it allows us to break down and combine transforms easily. The linearity of the Laplace transform is similar to the linearity of integrals, where we can distribute the transform across addition and subtraction, and pull out constants.
				</p>

				<example>
					<m>\ \ </m> Use the definition of the Laplace transform to compute:
					
					<me> \lap{15 + 6e^{7t} - 11t}. </me>
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							Let's start by applying the definition of the Laplace transform:
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{15\ +\amp\ 6e^{7t} - 11t}	
								</mrow>
								<mrow>		
										=\amp\ \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot \left(15 + 6e^{7t} - 11t\right)\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
										=\amp\ \int_0^{\infty} \left( 15e^{-st} + 6e^{-st} \cdot e^{7t} - 11e^{-st} \cdot t \right)\ dt
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Here, we've expanded the expression inside the integral. Notice that each term is something we've already encountered in previous sections. We can now use the linearity property to separate the integral:
							<md>
								<mrow>	
									=\amp\ 15\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st}\cdot 1\ dt + 6\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot e^{7t}\ dt - 11\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} \cdot t\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ 15\lap{1} + 6\lap{ e^{7t} } - 11\lap{ t }.
								</mrow>
							</md>
							We already know the Laplace transforms of these individual functions:
							<md>
								<mrow>
									=\amp\ \ub{\frac{15}{s}}_{s \gt 0} + 6\ub{\frac{1}{s - 7}}_{s \gt 7} - 11\ub{\frac{1}{s^2}}_{s \gt 0}.
								</mrow>
							</md>
							To satisfy all the conditions on <m>s</m>, we must have <m>s \gt 7</m> since that ensures all terms are defined. Therefore:
							<me>
								\lap{15 + 6e^{7t} - 11t} = \frac{15}{s} + 6\cdot \frac{1}{s-7} - \frac{11}{s^2}, \quad s \gt 7.
							</me>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
			
				<p>
					This example demonstrates the linearity property in action. The general statement of the linearity property is as follows: if <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are constants, then:
					<me> \lap{ a f(t) \pm b g(t) } = a \lap{ f(t) } \pm b \lap{ g(t) }, </me>
					or, equivalently:
					<me> \lap{ a f(t) \pm b g(t) } = a F(s) \pm b G(s). </me>

			<subsubsection><title> Multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> </title>
				<p>
					The translation property, also known as the first shifting theorem, allows us to handle functions multiplied by an exponential term, <m>e^{at}</m>. This property is particularly useful for simplifying the Laplace transforms of products of exponential functions and other functions, such as sine, cosine, or polynomials.
				</p>

				<example>
				
					<m>\ \ </m> Compute <m> \lap{e^{7t}\cos(3t)} </m>.
					
					<solution>
						<p>
							By the definition of the Laplace transform, we have:
							<md>
								<mrow> 
									\lap{e^{7t}\cos(3t)} 
										=\amp \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} e^{7t}\cos(3t)\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp \int_0^{\infty} e^{-st+7t} \cos(3t)\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp \int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s-7)t} \cos(3t)\ dt
								</mrow>
								<mrow> 
										=\amp \ub{\int_0^{\infty} e^{-(s_0)t} \cos(3t)\ dt}_{\lap{\cos(3t)}}, \quad \text{where } s_0 = s-7
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
										=\amp\ \frac{s_0}{s_0^2 + 9}  \qquad (s_0 \gt 0)
								</mrow>
								<mrow>
										=\amp\ \frac{s-7}{(s-7)^2 + 9} \qquad (s-7 \gt 0 \text{ or } s \gt 7)
								</mrow>
							</md>
							Thus, the Laplace transform of <m>e^{7t}\cos(3t)</m> is:
							<me>\ds \lap{e^{7t}\cos(3t)} = \frac{s-7}{(s-7)^2 + 9}, \quad s \gt 7.</me>
						</p>
					</solution>
				</example>
			
				<p>
					The translation property can be generalized for any function <m>f(t)</m> multiplied by <m>e^{at}</m>. The property is formally stated as:
					<me> \lap{ e^{at} f(t) } = F(s-a), </me>
					where <m>F(s)</m> is the Laplace transform of <m>f(t)</m>.
				</p>

					This result is crucial for solving differential equations. Essentially, it allows us to eliminate derivatives from an equation, transforming the problem into an algebraic form that's easier to solve. But there's more—this property also works recursively, allowing us to handle higher-order derivatives as well.
				</p>
				
				<p>

					<md>
						<mrow> 
							\lap{ f'(t) }

		<subsection><title>Forward Transforming Equations</title>
			<p>
				In the previous sections, we've focused on applying Laplace transforms to individual functions. Now, we shift our focus to solving differential equations by transforming the entire equation, along with its initial conditions. This process brings us back to the first step of the Laplace Transform Method roadmap.
			</p>

			<p>
				<image source="figures/Laplace-Roadmap-Step-1.png" width="100%">
					<shortdescription>Step 1: The Forward Laplace Transform</shortdescription>
				</image>
			</p>

			<p>
				To solve a differential equation using Laplace transforms, we apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation, leveraging the common transforms and properties we've discussed so far. Applying the transform to a function can be thought of as multiplying the function by <m>e^{-st}</m> and integrating with respect to <m>t</m>. However, instead of rewriting this process for each term, we simply apply the Laplace operator, <m>\laplacesym</m>, to both sides of the equation. Let's illustrate this with an example.
			</p>

			<example>
				<m>\ \ </m>Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem:
				<me>
					y'' + 3y' + 2y = -40e^{3t}, \quad y(0) = 0, \quad y'(0) = 1.
				</me>

				<solution>
					<p>
						First, we apply <m>\laplacesym</m> to both sides:
						<me>
							\lap{y'' + 3y' + 2y} = \lap{-40e^{3t}}.
						</me>
						Using the linearity property <xref ref="P1" text="custom">P<sub>1</sub></xref>, we break this into four separate transforms:
						<me>
							\ub{\lap{y''}}_{(1)} + 3\ub{\lap{y'}}_{(2)} + 2\ub{\lap{y}}_{(3)} = -40\ub{\lap{e^{3t}}}_{(4)}.
						</me>
					</p>

					<p>
						Now, let's compute each transform:
						<md>
							<mrow>
								(1):\quad \amp\ \lap{y''} = s^2Y - s\os{\large 0}{\os{\Large \shortparallel}{y(0)}} - \os{\large 1}{\os{\Large \shortparallel}{y'(0)}} = s^2Y - 1 \quad <xref ref="P4" text="title"/>.
							</mrow>
							<mrow>
								(2):\quad \amp\ \lap{y'} = sY - y(0) = sY \quad <xref ref="P3" text="title"/>.
							</mrow>
							<mrow>
								(3):\quad \amp\ \lap{y} = Y.
							</mrow>
							<mrow>
								(4):\quad \amp\ \lap{e^{3t}} = \frac{1}{s - 3} \quad <xref ref="L2" text="title"/>.
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>

					<p>
						Substituting these results back into the equation, we get:
						<md>
							<mrow>
								s^2Y - 1 + 3sY + 2Y =\amp\ \frac{-40}{s - 3}, \quad \text{or}
							</mrow>
							<mrow>
								s^2Y + 3sY + 2Y - 1 =\amp\ \frac{-40}{s - 3}.
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				Let's look at one more example for additional clarity.
			</p>

			<example>
				<m>\ \ </m>Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem:
				<me>
					y'' - 4y' + 6y = t^2, \quad y(0) = 2, \quad y'(0) = 0.
				</me>

				<solution>
					<p>
						Applying the Laplace transform to both sides:
						<md>
							<mrow>
								\lap{y'' - 4y' + 6y} =\amp\ \lap{t^2}, \\
								\lap{y''} - 4\lap{y'} + 6\lap{y} =\amp\ \lap{t^2}, \\
								s^2Y - s\os{\large 2}{\os{\Large \shortparallel}{y(0)}} - \os{\large 0}{\os{\Large \shortparallel}{y'(0)}} - 4(sY - \os{\large 2}{\os{\Large \shortparallel}{y(0)}}) + 6Y =\amp\ \frac{2}{s^3}, \\
								s^2Y - 2s - 4sY + 8 + 6Y =\amp\ \frac{2}{s^3}, \\
								s^2Y - 4sY + 6Y - 2s + 8 =\amp\ \frac{2}{s^3}.
							</mrow>
						</md>
					</p>
				</solution>
			</example>

			<p>
				In both examples, the differential equations have been transformed into algebraic equations. Solving for <m>Y(s)</m> is the next step in the Laplace Transform Roadmap.

					In this section, we introduced the concept of the forward Laplace transform and derived some common Laplace transforms that we will use throughtout this chapter. The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:
				</p>

				<p>
					<assemblage><title>Summary of the Key Ideas</title>
						<p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<term>Differential <m>\to</m> Algebraic Equations</term>. The Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation, simplifying the solution process by eliminating derivatives.
								</li>
								<li>
									<term>Laplace Transform Concept</term>. Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation involves transforming each term by multiplying by <m>e^{-st}</m> and integrating with respect to <m>t</m> from <m>0</m> to <m>\infty</m>, but is often simplified by directly applying the Laplace operator, <m>\laplacesym</m>.
								</li>
								<li>
									<term>Linearity Property</term>. The Laplace transform is linear, meaning it distributes across addition and subtraction, and allows for constants to be factored out. This property is essential for transforming complex equations.
								</li>
								<li>
									<term>Transforming Initial Conditions</term>. Initial conditions are incorporated directly into the Laplace-transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include initial values, making it easier to solve the resulting algebraic equation.
								</li>
								<li>
									<term>Common Function Transforms</term>. The Laplace transforms of common functions, such as exponentials, sines, cosines, and polynomials, are essential tools in transforming differential equations and are summarized in the provided table.
								</li>
								<li>
									<term>Transforming Derivatives</term>. The Laplace transform of a derivative, <m>y'(t)</m> or higher, transfers the derivative onto the Laplace variable <m>s</m>, reducing the order of the equation while introducing initial condition terms.

									<term>Multiplication by <m>e^{at}</m> and <m>t^n</m></term>. When multiplying a function by an exponential <m>e^{at}</m>, the Laplace transform shifts by <m>a</m> in the <m>s</m>-domain, and multiplying by <m>t^n</m> corresponds to differentiating the transform <m>n</m> times with respect to <m>s</m>, introducing a sign change.

								<li>
									<term>Transforming the Entire Equation</term>. The process of applying the Laplace transform to an entire differential equation with initial conditions involves systematically transforming each term and leads to a simplified algebraic equation in the <m>s</m>-domain, ready for solving.

	<chapter><title> Backward Transforms </title>
		<introduction>
			<p>
				Applying the Laplace transform method to a differential equation starts by transforming this equation into a new equation where the derivatives are replaced by algebraic expressions. To recover to the solution to the original equation the transformation must also be reversed. This process, which we will refer to as a <q>backwards transform</q>, corresponds to step 3 on the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace transform roadmap</xref>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Just as the forward Laplace transform simplifies a differential equation by converting it into an algebraic one, the backward transform completes the cycle by converting the algebraic solution back into its original form. This chapter will focus on the techniques used to perform the inverse Laplace transform, guiding you through the steps needed to move from the transformed function, <m>F(s)</m>, back to the original function, <m>f(t)</m>.
			</p>

			<p>
				We will explore key methods, such as partial fraction decomposition and the use of Laplace transform tables, to help simplify complex transformed functions. Additionally, we will highlight common challenges and how to overcome them, ensuring a smooth transition back to the original domain.
			</p>
		</introduction>

		<subsection><title> Selecting Forms </title> 
			<introduction>
				<p>
					Recall that the first step of the Laplace Transform Method involves a <xref ref="lt-roadmap-step1" text="custom">forward transformation</xref>, which converts the <m>y(t)</m>-equation into an equation containing <m>Y(S)</m> and <m>s</m>. Now, we skip ahead to the final step of the method, where we reverse this process to return to the <m>y(t)</m>-equation, revealing the solution to the original differential equation.
				</p>

				</figure>
				
				<p>
					This section will guide you through Step 3 of the Laplace Transform Method: identifying common forms, matching them to <m>Y(s)</m>, and ultimately recovering <m>y(t)</m>. Mastering this step will enable you to complete the solution of differential equations using the Laplace Transform Method.
				</p>
			</introduction>

			<subsubsection><title> Matched Forms </title> 
				<p>
					The Laplace Transform Method begins with the <xref ref="lt-roadmap-step1" text="custom">forward</xref> Laplace transform of a differential equation with an unknown function <m>y(t)</m> into an algebraic equation involving the transformed function <m>Y(s)</m>. Once we have solved for <m>Y(s)</m>, the final step is to recover the original function, <m>y(t)</m>, by applying the <xref ref="lt-roadmap-step3" text="custom">backward</xref> (inverse) Laplace transform, denoted as <m>\laplacesym^{-1}</m>.
				</p>

				<p>
					Much like how <m>\cos^{-1}</m> reverses the cosine function, applying <m>\laplacesym^{-1}</m> to both sides of a Laplace-transformed expression brings us back to the original function. For example, if
					<me>
						\lap{e^{-3t}} = \frac{1}{s+3},
					</me>
					then, applying the inverse Laplace transform gives:
					<me>
						\ilap{\frac{1}{s+3}} = e^{-3t}.
					</me>
					To identify the appropriate inverse Laplace transform, we rely on the common transforms in the table below, where we match the function of <m>s</m> on the right and the inverse is the function of <m>t</m> on the left.

					These examples demonstrate how to find the inverse Laplace Transform when the <m>s</m>-function matches a form on the right side of the common transforms table. However, not all functions will align perfectly with the table, and additional adjustments are needed to match the forms. In the next discussion, we will explore how to modify the <m>s</m>-function to match the common forms in the table.

			<subsubsection><title> Mismatched Forms </title>
				<p>
					When working with Laplace transforms, it's common to encounter algebraic expressions that don't perfectly match the standard forms we use for the inverse Laplace transform. In these cases, we need to manipulate the expression to make it fit one of the known forms.
				</p>

				<p>
					For example, consider the expression:
					<me> \frac{1}{s^2 + 25} \qquad \leftarrow \ \text{looks like} \quad \frac{b}{s^2 + b^2}. </me>
					While it's not an exact match, we can observe from the denominator that <m>b = 5.</m>
				</p>

				<p>
					However, the numerator doesn't match yet. To correct this, we need a 5 in the numerator. We can't just multiply the numerator by 5 without changing the value, so instead, we multiply the entire expression by <m>\frac{5}{5}</m>, which is equivalent to multiplying by 1:
					<md>
						<mrow>\frac{1}{s^2 + 25} 	=\amp\ \frac{1}{s^2 + 5^2} </mrow>
						<mrow>						=\amp\ \frac{5}{5} \cdot \frac{1}{s^2 + 5^2} </mrow>
						<mrow>						=\amp\ \frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{5}{s^2 + 5^2} \quad \us{\text{match}}{\os{\text{perfect}}{\leftarrow}}\ \frac{b}{s^2 + b^2}</mrow>
					</md>
					Multiplying by <m>\frac{5}{5}</m> doesn't change the value of the expression, but it allows us to match the standard form.
				</p>

				<p>
					One of the most common adjustments is introducing a missing constant in the numerator, as we did earlier. By multiplying both the numerator and denominator by this constant, we maintain the expression's value while transforming it into a recognizable form. Let's look at some examples:
				</p>

				<example>

					<m>\ \ </m>Compute the inverse Laplace transforms for each.

					<tabular>

						<row>
							<cell><m>\ds \frac{12}{s}</m></cell>
							<cell>
								<p>
									<m>\hspace{27em}</m>
									<solution>
										<p>
											The <m>s</m> in the denominator tells us that we need <m>L_1</m>. Before we do, let's factor out <m>12</m>:
											<me>\ds \ilap{\frac{12}{s}} = 12 \cdot \ilap{\frac{1}{s}} = 12 \cdot 1 = 12</me>.
										</p>
									</solution>

							<cell><m>\ds \frac{5}{s^2 + 4}</m></cell>
							<cell>
								<p>
									<m>\hspace{27em}</m>
									<solution>
										<p>
											Since the denominator has the form, <m>s^2 + \text{number}</m>, and there is no <m>s</m> in the numerator, we should apply <m>L_4</m>. As before, it is helpful to first factor out the constant <m>5</m>, 
											<me>\ds \ilap{\frac{5}{s^2 + 4}} = 5\ \ilap{\frac{1}{s^2 + 4}} \quad \leftarrow <xref ref="L4" text="custom"><m>L_4</m></xref> (b=2)</me>.
											According to <m>L_4</m>, we are missing <m>2</m> in the numerator. Let's put it there by multiplying by <m>2/2</m>, like so
											<md>
												<mrow> = 5\ \ilap{\frac{2}{2}\frac{1}{s^2 + 4}} =\amp\ 5\ \ilap{\frac{1}{2}\frac{2}{s^2 + 4}}</mrow>

							<cell><m>\ds \frac{17}{s^4}</m></cell>
							<cell>
								<p>
									<m>\hspace{27em}</m>
									<solution>
										<p>
											This denominator has the form <m>s^{\text{power}}</m>, which matches <m>L_3</m> with <m>n = 3</m>. 
											<me>\ds \ilap{\frac{17}{s^4}} = 17\ \ilap{\frac{1}{s^4}} \quad \leftarrow <xref ref="L3" text="custom"><m>L_3</m></xref> (n=3)</me>.
											In this case, the numerator is missing a <m>3!</m>. We can introduce it by multiplying by <m>3!/3!</m>, like so
											<md>
												<mrow> = 17\ \ilap{\frac{3!}{3!}\frac{1}{s^4}} = \frac{17}{3!} \ilap{\frac{3!}{s^4}} = \frac{17}{6} t^3</mrow>

											The denominator here is <m>s^2 + \text{number}</m>, which matches <m>L_5</m> with <m>b = 5</m>. Therefore,
											<md>
												<mrow> \ilap{\frac{7s}{s^2 + 25}}   =\amp\ 7\ \ilap{\frac{s}{s^2 + 25}} \quad \leftarrow <xref ref="L5" text="custom"><m>L_5</m></xref> (b=5)</mrow>

											The form of this denominator is <m>\ul{(s \pm \text{shift})^{2} + \text{number}}</m> and has no <m>s</m> in the numerator. This matches <m>L_7</m> with <m>a = 3</m> and <m>b = 5</m>. Therefore,
											<md>
												<mrow> \ilap{\frac{10}{(s - 3)^2 + 11}}</mrow>

											The denominator, <m>\ul{(s \pm \text{shift})^{\text{power}}}</m>, matches <m>L_6</m> with <m>a = -7</m> and <m>n = 4</m>. Therefore,
											<md>
