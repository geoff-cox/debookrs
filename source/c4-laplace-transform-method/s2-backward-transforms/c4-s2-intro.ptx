		Let's review the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">Laplace transform diagram</xref> to remember how we will leverage Laplace transforms to solve differential equations.
	</p>

	<p>
		The one last piece we need in order to solve DEs is to be able to take inverse Laplace transforms. We will focus on that piece now, and in the next section we will put all of our new skills together to solve DEs using Laplace transforms.
