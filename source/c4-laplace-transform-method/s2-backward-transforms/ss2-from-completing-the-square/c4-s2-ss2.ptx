<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms by Completing the Square </title>

    <p>
        We have shown how you can manipulate functions of <m>s</m>  to match properties in the Laplace transform table by taking advantage of the linearity of the Laplace transform. However, there are other algebraic manipulations you can (and sometimes must!) do, so we look at more examples here.
    </p>

    <example>
        <p>
            Find the inverse Laplace transform of <m>\ds H(s) = \frac{s-1}{s^2 - 2s + 5}</m>.
        </p>
        <solution>
            <p>
                As a general guideline, you are advised to consider the denominator when determining trying to determine which property or properties in the Laplace transform table might be appropriate. In this case, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator. None of the properties in the table looks <em> exactly</em> the same, but <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> and <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref> do have second-degree polynomials in the denominator. We just need to make our expression look like the form of those denominators, <m>(s - a)^2 + b^2.</m> This entails completing the square.

                    Margin note:  Notice that the sign on the 4 is positive. If the sign had been negative, this would not be a perfect match with the table and we'd have to use a different strategy. See Example (insert number here).

            <p>
                Now that we have changed the way <m>H(s)</m> looks, we see that it is a perfect match with <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>, with <m>a = 1</m> and <m>b = 2.</m>  Thus, we can take its inverse Laplace transform.

        <p>
            Find the inverse Laplace transform of <m>\ds P(s) = \frac{3s+2}{s^2 + 2s + 10}</m>.

        <solution>
            <p>
                As in the previous example, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, so we might try to make this expression match <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> and/or <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref> in the table. We begin by completing the square.

                    <mrow>\amp= \frac{3s+2}{(s^2 + 2s + 1) + 10 - 1}</mrow>

            </p>

            <p>
                Now we have the denominator in a format so that it matches with <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> or <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>, but unlike the previous example, the numerator is not an exact match with either <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> or <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>. We note that the numerator does have an <m>s</m> in it, so we will start by aiming to see if we can make it a match with <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>. If we did have a perfect match with <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>, then we would have <m>s+1</m> in the numerator. Let's focus on the numerator for a moment and consider the following.
                <me> 3s+2 = 3(s+1) + \msquare </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                In order to make the expressions equal, what value would the <m>\ds \msquare</m> have? If we distribute the three, we would have
                <me> 3s+2 = 3s + 3 + \msquare, </me>
                and thus it's clear that <m>\msquare</m> should be equal to <m>-1</m>. Let's use this to rewrite <m>P(s)</m> as follows.
                <md>
                    <mrow>P(s)	\amp= \frac{3s+2}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp= \frac{3(s+1) - 1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp= 3 \cdot \frac{s+1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2} - \frac{1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}.</mrow>
                </md>
            </p>

            <p>
                The advantage to writing <m>P(s)</m> this way is that the first fraction is now a perfect match for <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>. We need to find a perfect match for that second fraction. It looks close to <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref>, but not perfect. In order to be a perfect match for <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref>, we would need a 3 in the numerator. Luckily, we can multiply by one (in the form of <m>\frac{3}{3})</m> in order to get a 3 in the numerator, as follows.
                <md>
                    <mrow>P(s)	\amp= 3 \cdot \frac{s+1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2} - \frac{1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=  3 \cdot \frac{s+1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2} - \frac{3}{3}\cdot \frac{1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}</mrow>
                    <mrow>\amp=  3 \cdot \frac{s+1}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2} - \frac{1}{3}\cdot \frac{3}{(s+1)^2 + 3^2}.</mrow>

            </p>

            <p>
                Now that we have done some algebraic manipulation, we are now ready to take the inverse Laplace transform.

                As in the previous examples, the denominator is a second-degree polynomial; therefore it is sensible for us to begin by completing the square in the denominator as we did in the previous two examples.

                Take a careful look at the denominator here. It's really close to matching <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> or <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>, but it is not a match because of the negative sign in front of the <m>2^2.</m>  We need to change course when this happens. Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a <em> partial fraction decomposition.</em>

                We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.
                <me> \frac{s+9}{s^2 - 2s - 3}	= \frac{s+9}{(s-3)(s+1)}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is
                <me> \frac{s+9}{(s-3)(s+1)} = \frac{A}{s-3} + \frac{B}{s+1}. </me>

                Our next goal is to determine the coefficients <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here.

            <p>
                At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on <m>s</m> on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on <m>s</m> on the right hand side of the equation is <m>A+B</m>. Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, <m>A + B = 1.</m> Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have <m>A - 3B = 9.</m>  Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.
                <md>
                    <mrow>A + B	\amp= 1</mrow>

            <p>
                There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for <m>A</m>, and then substitute into the second equation,
                <md>
                    <mrow>A + B	\amp= 1		\amp 	A - 3B	\amp= 9</mrow>

                </md>
                hence we have
                <me> \frac{s+9}{(s-3)(s+1)} = \frac{3}{s-3} + \frac{-2}{s+1}. </me>

                Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform.

        In summary, when we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function with a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, we may complete the square or we may do a partial fraction decomposition. How will we know which is appropriate?	Here are a few guidelines for you to consider.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Does the denominator factor in an obvious way?  If so, factor the denominator and do a partial fraction decomposition if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the denominator does not factor in an obvious way, try completing the square. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If you end up with addition outside of the parentheses, as in <m>(s - a)^2 + b^2,</m> then you should aim to match <xref ref="LT-Table-L7" text="custom"><m>L7</m></xref> and/or <xref ref="LT-Table-L8" text="custom"><m>L8</m></xref>. 
            </li>
            <li>
                If instead you end up with subtraction outside the parentheses, as in <m>(s - a)^2 - b^2,</m> then you should factor and do a partial fraction decomposition. You may consider using the quadratic formula if the factorization is not obvious to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you end up with no terms outside the parentheses, as in <m>(s - a)^2,</m> then use <xref ref="LT-Table-L6" text="custom"><m>L6</m></xref>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        If you have a rational function where the denominator is of higher degree, then partial fraction decomposition should be used to break the single fraction into several simpler fractions. 
    </p>

    <example>
        <p>
            Find the inverse Laplace transform of
            <me> 
                R(s) = \frac{4s^3 - 13s^2 + 74s + 27}{s^4 - 4s^3 + 14s^2 + 44s + 25}	= \frac{4s^3 - 13s^2 + 74s + 27}{(s^2 - 6s + 25)(s+1)^2}. 
            </me>
        </p>
        <solution>
            <p>
                Note that as the quadratic term in the denominator does not factor, the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor and a repeated linear factor. We'll proceed by simplifying this complicated fraction with a Partial Fraction Decomposition of the form
                <me> \frac{4s^3 - 13s^2 + 74s + 27}{(s^2 - 6s + 25)(s+1)^2}
                    = \frac{As + B}{s^2 - 6s + 25} + \frac{C}{s+1} + \frac{D}{(s+1)^2}. </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                You may also consider using technology to find a partial fraction decomposition. You should get 
                <me> 
                    \frac{4s^3 - 13s^2 + 74s + 27}{(s^2 - 6s + 25)(s+1)^2} = \frac{s + 2}{s^2 - 6s + 25} + \frac{3}{s+1} + \frac{-2}{(s+1)^2}.

            </p>

            <p>
                With the partial fraction decomposition in hand, we are prepared to take the inverse Laplace transform, using the same types of algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the previous examples.

            As we progress through the Laplace Transform Method, the modifications required to match the s-function to a known form in the backward transform table become more intricate. One of the first major modifications we encounter is completing the square. This technique allows us to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a recognizable form that corresponds to the sine or cosine entries in the common Laplace transforms table.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Completing the square is a powerful tool when faced with quadratic expressions that don’t immediately match any of the standard forms. For example, if you see a quadratic expression like <m>s^2 + 4s + 8</m>, you can use completing the square to rewrite it as something resembling <m>(s+a)^2 + b^2</m>. The key to recognizing when this technique is needed lies in the structure of the quadratic expression: if the quadratic has both linear and constant terms but cannot be factored easily, completing the square is often the next step.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The strategy is straightforward: first, identify the coefficient of the linear term, then use it to complete the square. Specifically, given a quadratic of the form <m>s^2 + as + b</m>, you would take half of the linear coefficient, square it, and add and subtract it within the expression. This transforms the quadratic into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant, making it easier to handle in the context of Laplace transforms.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Let's walk through a few examples to illustrate how completing the square can simplify the inverse Laplace transform process.
        </p>
    
        <example>
            <m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 + 6s + 10</m> by completing the square.
            
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Start by taking half of the linear coefficient, <m>6/2 = 3</m>, and squaring it to get <m>9</m>. Then add and subtract <m>9</m> inside the expression:
                    <md>
                        s^2 + 6s + 10 = (s^2 + 6s + 9) + 1 = (s + 3)^2 + 1.
                    </md>
                    Now, the expression is in a form that matches the cosine or sine entries in the Laplace transform table.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <example>
            <m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 - 4s + 13</m> by completing the square.
            
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Take half of the linear coefficient, <m>-4/2 = -2</m>, and square it to get <m>4</m>. Add and subtract <m>4</m>:
                    <md>
                        s^2 - 4s + 13 = (s^2 - 4s + 4) + 9 = (s - 2)^2 + 9.
                    </md>
                    This expression now matches the standard form for inverse Laplace transforms involving sine or cosine.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <example>
            <m>\quad</m>Rewrite <m>s^2 + 8s + 20</m> by completing the square.
            
            <solution>
                <p>
                    Take half of the linear coefficient, <m>8/2 = 4</m>, and square it to get <m>16</m>. Add and subtract <m>16</m>:
                    <md>
                        s^2 + 8s + 20 = (s^2 + 8s + 16) + 4 = (s + 4)^2 + 4.
                    </md>
                    This allows you to apply the inverse Laplace transform for sine or cosine functions.
                </p>
            </solution>
        </example>
    
        <p>
            Completing the square is an essential technique for transforming quadratic expressions that don't directly match a form in the table of common Laplace transforms. However, it's not the only strategy available. In the next subsection, we'll explore another important technique: partial fraction decomposition. This method is useful for breaking down complex fractions into simpler components that can each be matched with forms in the Laplace transform table.
        </p>
    


            <p>
                In the previous subsections, we discussed minor modifications that could be made to the <m>s</m>-function in order to match it with a known form in the backward Laplace transform table. However, not all modifications are as simple. One such modification is completing the square in the denominator of an expression. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with quadratic expressions in the denominator that don't immediately fit a recognizable form in the Laplace transform table.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                The goal of completing the square is to rewrite the quadratic expression in a form that can be matched with a sine or cosine Laplace transform. This typically involves expressing the quadratic as <m>(s-a)^2 + b^2</m>, which corresponds to the standard forms for the inverse transforms of sine and cosine functions.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                Recognizing when completing the square is necessary usually comes down to noticing a quadratic expression in the denominator that doesn't factor easily or match any of the simple forms. In these cases, completing the square becomes a powerful tool to transform the expression into a usable form.
            </p>
        
            <example>
                <p>
                    Find the inverse Laplace transform of <m>\ds H(s) = \frac{s-1}{s^2 - 2s + 5}</m>.
                </p>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        To solve this, we first complete the square in the denominator. The quadratic expression <m>s^2 - 2s + 5</m> can be rewritten as:
                        <md>
                            s^2 - 2s + 5 = (s - 1)^2 + 4.
                        </md>
                        Now, the expression for <m>H(s)</m> becomes:
                        <md>
                            H(s) = \frac{s-1}{(s - 1)^2 + 4}.
                        </md>
                        This matches the form of the cosine Laplace transform, so we apply the inverse Laplace transform:
                        <md>
                            h(t) = \lap^{-1}\left\{ H(s) \right\} = e^{t}\cos(2t).
                        </md>
                    </p>
                </solution>
            </example>
        
            <example>
                <p>
                    Find the inverse Laplace transform of <m>\ds P(s) = \frac{3s+2}{s^2 + 2s + 10}</m>.
                </p>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        First, complete the square in the denominator:
                        <md>
                            s^2 + 2s + 10 = (s + 1)^2 + 9.
                        </md>
                        Now, the expression becomes:
                        <md>
                            P(s) = \frac{3s+2}{(s+1)^2 + 9}.
                        </md>
                        The numerator does not exactly match the standard form, so we decompose it:
                        <md>
                            P(s) = 3 \cdot \frac{s+1}{(s+1)^2 + 9} - \frac{1}{(s+1)^2 + 9}.
                        </md>
                        Applying the inverse Laplace transform gives:
                        <md>
                            p(t) = 3e^{-t}\cos(3t) - \frac{1}{3}e^{-t}\sin(3t).
                        </md>
                    </p>

            <example>
                <p>
                    Find the inverse Laplace transform of <m>\ds Q(s) = \frac{s-11}{s^2 - 6s + 14}</m>.

                    <p>
                        Completing the square in the denominator:
                        <md>
                            s^2 - 6s + 14 = (s - 3)^2 + 5.
                        </md>
                        The expression becomes:

                            Q(s) = \frac{s-11}{(s - 3)^2 + 5}.
                        </md>
                        We can decompose the numerator:
                        <md>
                            Q(s) = \frac{s-3 - 8}{(s - 3)^2 + 5}.
                        </md>
                        Applying the inverse Laplace transform gives:
                        <md>
                            q(t) = e^{3t}\cos(\sqrt{5}t) - \frac{8}{\sqrt{5}}e^{3t}\sin(\sqrt{5}t).
                        </md>
                    </p>

                Completing the square is a crucial technique when working with quadratic expressions in the denominator of Laplace transforms. It allows us to rewrite the expression in a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms, making the backward transformation process more manageable. In the next subsection, we will explore another essential technique: partial fraction decomposition, which helps in breaking down more complex fractions into simpler components that can be easily transformed.
