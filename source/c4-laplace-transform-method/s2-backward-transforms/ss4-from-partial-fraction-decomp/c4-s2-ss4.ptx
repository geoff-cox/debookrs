<section xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title>Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms Using Partial Fraction Decomposition</title>

    <p>
        When working with the Laplace Transform Method, you will sometimes encounter rational functions where the denominator is a polynomial that can be factored into simpler linear or quadratic factors. In such cases, partial fraction decomposition is a powerful technique that allows us to express the complex rational function as a sum of simpler fractions. These simpler fractions often correspond directly to known forms in the table of Laplace transforms, making it easier to apply the inverse transform.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key idea behind partial fraction decomposition is to break down the original rational function into a sum of fractions, each with a simpler denominator. For example, if the denominator can be factored as <m>(s - a)(s - b)</m>, we can express the rational function as a sum of fractions with these linear factors as denominators. The goal is to match each of these fractions with a form in the Laplace transform table, allowing us to compute the inverse transform.

		Let's explore this technique through a series of examples, starting with a quadratic denominator and gradually increasing the complexity.

    <example>

		<m>\quad</m>Find the inverse Laplace transforms of each function.
        <me>
			Y(s) = \frac{2s + 5}{(s + 1)(s + 4)}, \quad 
			P(s) = \frac{2s + 3}{s^2 + 5s + 6}, \quad 
			Q(s) = \frac{3s + 4}{s^2 - 2s + 1}
		</me>
    
		<solution>
            <p>
                First, we decompose <m>Y(s)</m> into partial fractions:
                <me>\frac{2s + 5}{(s + 1)(s + 4)} = \frac{A}{s + 1} + \frac{B}{s + 4}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
                To find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, we multiply both sides by the denominator <m>(s + 1)(s + 4)</m> and solve for the coefficients:
                <me>
                    2s + 5 = A(s + 4) + B(s + 1).
                </me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Expanding and collecting like terms, we get:
                <me>
                    2s + 5 = (A + B)s + (4A + B).
                </me>
                Comparing coefficients, we find:
                <me>A + B = 2, \quad 4A + B = 5.</me>
                Solving this system of equations, we obtain:
                <me>A = 1, \quad B = 1.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of <m>Y(s)</m> is:
                <me>\frac{1}{s + 1} + \frac{1}{s + 4}.</me>
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:
                <me>\ilap{Y(s)} = \ilap{\frac{1}{s + 1}} + \ilap{\frac{1}{s + 4}} = e^{-t} + e^{-4t}.</me>
            </p>
        </solution>

		<solution>
			<p>
				First, factor the quadratic denominator:
				<me>s^2 + 5s + 6 = (s + 2)(s + 3).</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, decompose <m>P(s)</m> into partial fractions:
				<me>\frac{2s + 3}{(s + 2)(s + 3)} = \frac{A}{s + 2} + \frac{B}{s + 3}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, multiply both sides by the denominator <m>(s + 2)(s + 3)</m> and solve for the coefficients:
				<me>
					2s + 3 = A(s + 3) + B(s + 2).
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Expanding and collecting like terms, we get:
				<me>
					2s + 3 = (A + B)s + (3A + 2B).
				</me>
				Comparing coefficients, we find:
				<me>A + B = 2, \quad 3A + 2B = 3.</me>
				Solving this system of equations, we obtain:
				<me>A = 1, \quad B = 1.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of <m>P(s)</m> is:
				<me>\frac{1}{s + 2} + \frac{1}{s + 3}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:
				<me>\ilap{P(s)} = e^{-2t} + e^{-3t}.</me>
			</p>
		</solution>

		<solution>
			<p>
				First, factor the quadratic denominator:
				<me>s^2 - 2s + 1 = (s - 1)^2.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, decompose <m>Q(s)</m> into partial fractions:
				<me>\frac{3s + 4}{(s - 1)^2} = \frac{A}{s - 1} + \frac{B}{(s - 1)^2}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>, multiply both sides by the denominator <m>(s - 1)^2</m> and solve for the coefficients:
				<me>
					3s + 4 = A(s - 1) + B.
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Expanding and collecting like terms, we get:
				<me>
					3s + 4 = As - A + B.
				</me>
				Comparing coefficients, we find:
				<me>A = 3, \quad B - A = 4.</me>
				Solving this system, we find <m>A = 3</m> and <m>B = 7.</m>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of <m>Q(s)</m> is:
				<me>\frac{3}{s - 1} + \frac{7}{(s - 1)^2}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:
				<me>\ilap{Q(s)} = 3e^{t} + 7te^{t}.</me>
			</p>

		Partial fraction decompostion also works for functions with higher-degree polynomials in the denominator. The key is to factor each denominator into as many linear and/or quadratic factors as possible. Here are a few examples to illustrate this concept.
	</p>

	<example>
		
		<m>\quad</m>Find the inverse Laplace transforms of each function.
        <me>
			R(s) = \frac{2s^2 + 5s + 1}{s^3 - s}, \quad 
			S(s) = \frac{4s^3 + 3s^2 - 2s + 1}{s^4 - 1}
		</me>

		<solution>
			<p>
				First, factor the cubic denominator:
				<me>s^3 - s = s(s - 1)(s + 1).</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, decompose <m>R(s)</m> into partial fractions:
				<me>\frac{2s^2 + 5s + 1}{s(s - 1)(s + 1)} = \frac{A}{s} + \frac{B}{s - 1} + \frac{C}{s + 1}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>, multiply both sides by the denominator <m>s(s - 1)(s + 1)</m> and solve for the coefficients:
				<me>
					2s^2 + 5s + 1 = A(s - 1)(s + 1) + Bs(s + 1) + Cs(s - 1).
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Expanding and collecting like terms, we get:
				<me>
					2s^2 + 5s + 1 = (A + B + C)s^2 + (B - C)s + A.
				</me>
				Comparing coefficients, we find:
				<me>A + B + C = 2, \quad B - C = 5, \quad A = 1.</me>
				Solving this system, we find <m>A = 1</m>, <m>B = 2</m>, and <m>C = 3.</m>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of <m>R(s)</m> is:
				<me>\frac{1}{s} + \frac{2}{s - 1} + \frac{3}{s + 1}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:
				<me>\ilap{R(s)} = 1 + 2e^{t} + 3e^{-t}.</me>
			</p>
		</solution>
	
		<solution>
			<p>
				First, factor the quartic denominator:
				<me>s^4 - 1 = (s^2 - 1)(s^2 + 1) = (s - 1)(s + 1)(s^2 + 1).</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Next, decompose <m>S(s)</m> into partial fractions:
				<me>\frac{4s^3 + 3s^2 - 2s + 1}{(s - 1)(s + 1)(s^2 + 1)} = \frac{A}{s - 1} + \frac{B}{s + 1} + \frac{Cs + D}{s^2 + 1}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				To find <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m>, multiply both sides by the denominator <m>(s - 1)(s + 1)(s^2 + 1)</m> and solve for the coefficients:
				<me>
					4s^3 + 3s^2 - 2s + 1 = A(s + 1)(s^2 + 1) + B(s - 1)(s^2 + 1) + (Cs + D)(s - 1)(s + 1).
				</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Expanding and collecting like terms, we find <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, <m>C</m>, and <m>D</m> by comparing coefficients. Solving the system of equations, we find:
				<me>A = 1, \quad B = -1, \quad C = 4, \quad D = 3.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of <m>S(s)</m> is:
				<me>\frac{1}{s - 1} - \frac{1}{s + 1} + \frac{4s + 3}{s^2 + 1}.</me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:
				<me>\ilap{S(s)} = e^{t} - e^{-t} + 4\cos(t) + 3\sin(t).</me>
			</p>
		</solution>

	</example>

		Partial fraction decomposition is a powerful technique when working with rational functions in Laplace transforms. By breaking down complex expressions into simpler fractions, you can match them to known inverse Laplace transforms, making the backward transformation process much easier. In the next subsection, we will explore more advanced techniques for handling cases with repeated roots and higher-order polynomials.
