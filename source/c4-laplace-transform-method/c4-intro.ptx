		In the previous chapter, we learned a method for solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients. However, this method couldn't handle nonhomogeneous functions that are discontinuous. To address this limitation, let's study the Laplace Transform.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Laplace Transform is a versatile tool used to solve various types of differential equations, even those with discontinuous nonhomogeneous functions. It's named after the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace and is a generalization of the Fourier Transform used in engineering and signal processing.

		In this chapter, we will introduce the Laplace Transform and its properties. We'll see how it can be applied to solve DEs with constant coefficients and discontinuous nonhomogeneous functions. Additionally, we will explore the inverse Laplace Transform and its use in recovering the original function. We'll also cover the Laplace Transform of common engineering functions such as the unit step, unit impulse, unit ramp, unit parabolic, and unit exponential functions. Their relevance in solving DEs with initial conditions will also be discussed.

		When solving an algebra equation, it's often enough to isolate the unknown variable. However, in differential equations, isolating the unknown, which is buried under derivatives, isn't as simple. The Laplace Transform temporarily alters the equation, essentially <q>unpeeling</q> the derivatives and allowing for isolation of the unknown similar to algebra.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Laplace Transform works by extracting the dependent variable from its derivative and encapsulating it inside a special integral. These integrals act as a temporary <q>nutshell</q> containing the unknown we seek. In this transformed state, these nutshells can be combined and moved around, like in algebra. Therefore, isolating a nutshell also isolates the unknown function trapped within. Reverting the transform from this new equation, releases the unknown and reveals the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Laplace Transform essentially changes the environment of the differential equation, simplifying the process of isolating and solving for the unknown function. This powerful tool especially useful for solving LNCC equations where the right-hand side function is discontinuous.
