		When solving an algebra equation, it's often enough to isolate the unknown variable. However, in differential equations, isolating the unknown, which is buried under derivatives, isn't as simple. The Laplace Transform temporarily alters the equation, essentially <q>unpeeling</q> the derivatives and allowing for isolation of the unknown similar to algebra.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Laplace Transform works by extracting the dependent variable from its derivative and encapsulating it inside a special integral. These integrals act as a temporary <q>nutshell</q> containing the unknown we seek. In this transformed state, these nutshells can be combined and moved around, like in algebra. Therefore, isolating a nutshell also isolates the unknown function trapped within. Reverting the transform from this new equation, releases the unknown and reveals the solution.
	</p>

	<p>
		The Laplace Transform essentially changes the environment of the differential equation, simplifying the process of isolating and solving for the unknown function. This powerful tool especially useful for solving LNCC equations where the right-hand side function is discontinuous.

		Throughout this chapter, we will continue to tie ideas back to this roadmap and the contained initial-value problem,
		<mdn xml:id="lt-model-ivp">
			<mrow xml:id="lt-model-equation">
				y'' + 3y' + 2y = -40e^{3t},
			</mrow>
			<mrow xml:id="lt-model-initial-values">
				y(0) = 0, \quad y'(0) = 1,
			</mrow>,
		</mdn>
		will serve as a model problem to illustrate many of the concepts.
