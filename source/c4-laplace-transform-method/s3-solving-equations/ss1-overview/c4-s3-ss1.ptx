<subsection xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"><title> Overview </title>

	<p>
		At this point, the <xref ref="lt-roadmap" text="custom">roadmap</xref> introduced at the beginning of this chapter should start to come together. You've learned how the forward Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation and how the backward Laplace transform converts the original transform to recover the solution. Now, it's time to see how all these pieces fit into the bigger picture of solving differential equations using the Laplace Transform Method.
	</p>

	<p>
		This method is powerful because it leverages integration properties and the exponential function to transform a differential equation into an algebra problem. In essence, the process begins by applying the forward Laplace transform to the entire differential equation (Step 1), which temporarily encases the unknown inside <m>Y(s)</m>. Next, you use algebra to isolate <m>Y(s)</m> (Step 2). After that, you prepare for the backward transform by breaking <m>Y(s)</m> into a sum of functions that correspond to known Laplace transforms (Step 3). Finally, you apply the backward transform to <m>Y(s)</m> to recover the solution, <m>y(t)</m> (Step 4).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		All of these steps have been explored in previous sections, and now, you are ready to apply them in sequence to solve a complete initial-value problem. The general strategy for this method is outlined as follows:
	</p>

	<exploration xml:id="lt-method"><title>Laplace Transform Method</title>
		<p>
			The particular solution to the initial-valued differential equation
			<men xml:id="lt-method-de">
				y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}\, y^{(n-1)} + \cdots + a_1\, y' + a_0\, y = g(t)
			</men>
			and given initial conditions, follows from these steps:
		
			<dl width="narrow">
				<li xml:id="lt-step-1"><title>Step 1: Apply the Forward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Apply the Laplace transform, <m>\lap</m>, to both sides of <xref ref="lt-method-de" />. Use the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table</xref> and <xref ref="lt-properties-table" text="custom">properties</xref> to convert each term into a function of <m>s</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-2"><title>Step 2: Solve for <m>Y(s)</m></title>
					<p>
						Use algebra to isolate <m>Y(s)</m> as a function of <m>s</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-3"><title>Step 3: Prepare for the Backward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Use techniques such as completing the square or partial fraction decompoition to rewrite <m>Y(s)</m> as a sum of <m>s</m>-functions found in the <xref ref="common-lt-table" text="custom">table of common transforms</xref>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li xml:id="lt-step-4"><title>Step 4: Apply the Backward Transform</title>
					<p>
						Apply the inverse Laplace transform, <m>\lap^{-1}</m>, to both sides of the <m>Y(s)</m> equation to get the solution <m>y(t)</m>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</dl>

    <p>
        By following these steps, the Laplace Transform Method provides a clear path from the original differential equation to its solution, leveraging the power of both forward and backward transforms.
