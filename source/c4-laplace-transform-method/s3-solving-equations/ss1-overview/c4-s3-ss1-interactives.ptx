                    <p>
                        Correct! The forward Laplace transform simplifies the differential equation by converting it into an algebraic form in terms of <m> Y(s) </m>.

                    <p>
                        Not quite. The forward Laplace transform is used to convert the differential equation into an algebraic equation, not to find the solution directly.

                <feedback>
                    <p>
                        Close, but the main purpose of the forward transform is to convert the differential equation into an algebraic equation involving <m> s </m>, not just to rewrite it as a sum of functions.

                <feedback>
                    <p>
                        Incorrect. The Laplace transform does not directly simplify the coefficients but rather transforms the entire differential equation into an algebraic equation in terms of <m> s </m>.
