  "body": "  This book was written with a simple goal: to help you learn differential equations in a way that feels approachable, logical, and connected to the real world. Too often, students encounter differential equations as a blur of techniques and formulas, each with its own quirks and conditions, without seeing the bigger picture. I wanted to write something different—a book that explains not only how the methods work, but also why they exist, when to use them, and what they tell us about the systems they describe.  From the start, we take the time to answer the deceptively simple question: what is a differential equation? We build up the vocabulary—order, linearity, coefficients—that you'll need to make sense of every chapter that follows. Then we move step by step through the main families of techniques: separation of variables, integrating factors, and methods for solving linear equations with constant coefficients. Each method is introduced in context, not just as a recipe, so you understand the logic behind the steps rather than memorizing them blindly.  But this book isn't only about solutions you can write down neatly. Some of the most interesting and important differential equations can't be solved with a clean formula. That's where we shift focus to qualitative methods —tools like slope fields, phase lines, and equilibrium analysis that reveal how solutions behave without ever finding them explicitly. Later, we introduce numerical methods like Euler's method, showing how computers approximate solutions when analytic methods run out. These chapters are as much about mindset as they are about mechanics.  As we move into higher-order equations, Laplace transforms, and systems of differential equations, the narrative grows but the tone stays the same: conversational, patient, and realistic about what's challenging. Each topic is broken into digestible parts, with worked examples, quick-reference summaries, and guiding comments that aim to make the path through this subject a little clearer.  This book is not meant to overwhelm you with theory, nor to flatten the subject into a list of disconnected tricks. Instead, it aims to be a tour guide —helping you see the terrain of differential equations, pointing out landmarks, and showing you where different paths lead. If you are an engineer, physicist, mathematician, or simply curious about how we model the world, I hope this book helps you not just do differential equations, but genuinely understand them.    Textbook Aim & Scope  This book is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and their applications. It covers the fundamental concepts, methods, and techniques used to solve ODEs, with a focus on both theoretical understanding and practical problem-solving skills.  This interactive online text is intended to be used to learn the introductory concepts of ordinary differential equations. The book is designed for students who have completed single-variable calculus and is suitable for a one semester course in differential equations. The book is written in a straightforward, readable style and has a large number of worked examples and exercises.    Intended Audience  This book is intended for undergraduate students who are studying differential equations for the first time. It is designed to be accessible to students with a background in single-variable calculus, and it assumes no prior knowledge of differential equations. The book is suitable for use in a one-semester course on ordinary differential equations.    Philosophy  We believe that the best way to learn differential equations is to work through examples and exercises. This book is designed to be interactive, allowing you to explore the concepts and methods of differential equations in a hands-on way. We encourage you to work through the examples and exercises, and to use the interactive features of the book to deepen your understanding.  We also believe that it is important to understand the underlying concepts and methods of differential equations, rather than just memorizing formulas and techniques. This book is designed to help you develop a deep understanding of the subject, so that you can apply the concepts and methods to a wide range of problems.  We hope that this book will be a valuable resource for you as you learn differential equations, and that it will help you develop the skills and understanding you need to succeed in your studies and future career.    Textbook Structure and Approach  The book is structured to guide you through the process of solving differential equations, starting with the basic concepts and building up to more advanced techniques. Each section includes examples and exercises that illustrate the concepts and methods, and we encourage you to work through these examples and exercises to gain a deeper understanding of the material.  Solving these equations often involves using concepts from various mathematical disciplines, including calculus, algebra, and trigonometry. To simplify the process, we break down each technique into smaller, manageable parts and then assemble them step by step to obtain the complete solution.  When appropriate, we will go over the details of the integration and algebra steps, but it is assumed that you are already familiar with these topics. If not, we encourage you to seek out resources to brush up on these skills.    "

  "body": " Connection to Algebra & Calculus  🎧 Listen  To learn something new, it helps to connect it to something you already know. So let's begin by linking differential equations to algebra.  Suppose you're asked to solve each of the equations for : The goal of algebra is to determine what goes in place of to make both sides equal. Instead of guessing, you learned rules for isolating . Applying those rules, we find:   Now suppose you're asked to solve a new equation: As before, we isolate : So what function has a derivative of ? In other words, what goes in place of to make this equation true?  From calculus, you might recognize this as an anti-derivative problem. So the we seek is   Finding this is exactly what solving a differential equation aims to do. Most problems won't be quite that straightforward, but the goal is the same: find a function that fits in place of and makes the equation true.    📖❓ Solving for an Unknown   How are differential equations related to equations from algebra?      You are solving an equation for an unknown.    Correct! When you solve a differential equation, the unknown is a function rather than a number.      You are only evaluating derivatives at a single point.    A differential equation is not about evaluating a derivative at a point, but about finding a function that satisfies an equation.      You are checking whether a given function is differentiable.    Differentiability may matter, but the main goal is to determine the unknown function.      You are simplifying an expression without solving for a variable.    Simplification alone is not enough; solving a differential equation means finding what function belongs in place of the unknown.       📖❓ Role of Derivatives   How are differential equations related to calculus?      Differential equations are equations containing derivatives of the unknown function.    Correct! Differential equations rely on derivatives, which are a central topic in calculus.      Differential equations contain integrals.    While integrals may appear when solving them, differential equations are defined by the presence of derivatives, not integrals.      Differential equations find derivates of a function.    Actually, differential equations involve finding the function itself, not just its derivatives.      The limit of a differential equation is an algebraic equation.    Please reread this section.       "

  "body": " Differential Equation Definition  Essentially, a differential equation is any equation where the unknown has a derivative applied to it. Here's the formal definition.   Differential Equation   A differential equation (DE) is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. If the function depends on a single variable, it's called an ordinary differential equation (ODE) . If the function depends on more than one variable, it's called a partial differential equation (PDE) .    DE ODE  📌 Since this course only covers ordinary differential equations , any time we say differential equation or DE , we mean ODE .   So, for an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include two things: First, it needs a derivative—something like or . Second, it must have an equals sign.  That means all of the following are differential equations: On the other hand, these are not differential equations—either because they don't contain a derivative, or because they don't include an equals sign:     📖❓Not Required for a DE   Which of the following is NOT required for an equation to be classified as a differential equation?     A -variable  Correct! A -variable is not a requirement for a differential equation.    An unknown function  Incorrect.

  "title": "Terms, &amp; Coefficients",
  "body": " Terms, & Coefficients   Terms   In math, the word term usually refers to a part of an expression that's separated by plus or minus signs. The same idea applies to differential equations.  So, a term in a differential equation is just any piece of the equation separated by addition or subtraction. For example, we might have something like: This example has three terms on the left-hand side and two on the right.   Free terms   📌 Think of a free term as being free of the dependent variable.   📌 These are often called constant terms , but this can be misleading since they are allowed to contain independent variables.   Terms in a differential equation can include the dependent variable, its derivatives, constants, or other functions of the independent variable. If a term doesn't involve the dependent variable or its derivatives, we'll call it a free term .  For example, consider the five-term differential equation with dependent variable, : . It is common to break the terms down based on the form of the dependent variable they contain. So, in terms of , we have the following terms:                           Every differential equation has a free term, even if it's not written explicitly. For example, can be rewritten as , where the free term is .  In general, any missing term can be interpreted as a zero term.    Identify the free term in the differential equation         Incorrect. This term contains a derivative of the dependent variable , so it is not a free term.       Incorrect. This term involves the dependent variable , so it is not a free term.       Correct! is the free term because it does not contain the dependent variable .       Coefficients   A coefficient in a differential equation is a constant or a function that depends only on the independent variable, and it multiplies the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. Coefficients help determine the structure of the equation and influence which solution methods are possible.  For example, take the equation: the coefficients of , , and are the constants , , and , respectively.  Now, coefficients don't always have to be constants. They can also be functions of the independent variable. For instance, in the equation: the coefficients are the following functions of :              In general, for something to be considered a coefficient, it must not involve the dependent variable.

Essentially, a differential equation is linear if every term in the equation is linear . If just one term is nonlinear, the entire equation is nonlinear . We formally define linear differential equations as follows:    Select the true statement.     An equation is nonlinear if at least one of its terms are nonlinear.  Correct! A differential equation is nonlinear if any of its terms are nonlinear.    An equation is linear if at least one of its terms are linear.  Incorrect. A differential equation needs all of its terms to be linear.    As long as there are more linear terms than nonlinear terms, the equation is linear.  Incorrect.      Linear Differential Equations   A differential equation is linear if it can be written as a sum of linear terms involving the dependent variable and its derivatives: This structure is known as a linear combination of the dependent variable and its derivatives.  where each is a function of the independent variable only, and is the input or forcing term.    For example, the following differential equations are linear:   Each term involving the dependent variable or its derivatives is linear, none appear raised to a power, inside a function, or multiplied together.  In contrast, the following equations are nonlinear because they include at least one nonlinear term (✷):   In each case, it only took one term to violate the definition of a linear differential equation.  Let's practice identifying the linearty of entire equations with a few examples.   Identify the Linearity of the Equation   Determine whether each of the following differential equations is linear:     In the first equation, all terms involving or its derivatives appear linearly: So the equation is linear.  In the second equation, the term is nonlinear, since appears in both the numerator and denominator: This makes the entire equation nonlinear.      Identify the Linear Equations   Click-on all the linear differential equations.                          Remember that a linear differential equation contains only linear terms. Four of these equations are linear.    Linear equations only involve the dependent variable and its derivatives to the first power, and they won't be inside nonlinear functions like sine or multiplied by each other.     Identify the Nonlinear Equations   Click-on all the nonlinear differential equations                          First identify the dependent variable, then carefully look at each term to determine if it is nonlinear. There are six nonlinear equations here.    Nonlinear equations often have terms where the dependent variable or its derivatives are raised to powers other than one, or are inside functions like sine, logarithms, or are multiplied by each other.

Substituting into the equation, we get Since is an undeniably true statement, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is not true, so is not a solution to the equation.    The process of verifying solutions to differential equations is exactly the same.

(a)    To be a solution to the equation, must satisfy the equation. That is, when we substitute into the equation, the result simplifies to a true statement.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is an undeniably true statement, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is not true, so is not a solution to the equation.    The process of verifying solutions to differential equations is exactly the same. However, with differential equations, we have to be more careful about confirming a true statement . With numbers, it is easy to see if is true, but with functions, its a bit more tricky. We have to be sure that the functions are equal for all values of (or the independent variable). For example, the statement is true since . In contrast, the statement is not true since for all values of . It only takes one value of to make the statement false. Let's try a few values of to see this.                                The fact that the statement is not true for is enough to show that this is not a true statement and would not correspond to a solution to a differential equation.     (b)  A general solution represents the form of all possible solutions to a differential equation, typically with one or more arbitrary constants. A family of solutions is an infinite set of solutions, one for each possible combination of constant values in the general solution. A particular solution is a single solution that satisfies the differential equation with specific values for the constants.   (c)  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution. Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   (d)  Integrating both sides gives Without knowing , we cannot simplify . So the obstacle is that we are unable to combine these variables into a single on the left side.       "

Substituting into the equation, we get Since is not true, so is not a solution to the equation.    The process of verifying solutions to differential equations is exactly the same. However, with differential equations, we have to be more careful about confirming a true statement . With numbers, it is easy to see if is true, but with functions, its a bit more tricky. We have to be sure that the functions are equal for all values of (or the independent variable). For example, the statement is true since . In contrast, the statement is not true since for all values of . It only takes one value of to make the statement false. Let's try a few values of to see this.                                The fact that the statement is not true for is enough to show that this is not a true statement and would not correspond to a solution to a differential equation.     (b)  A general solution represents the form of all possible solutions to a differential equation, typically with one or more arbitrary constants. A family of solutions is an infinite set of solutions, one for each possible combination of constant values in the general solution. A particular solution is a single solution that satisfies the differential equation with specific values for the constants.   (c)  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution. Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   (d)  Integrating both sides gives Without knowing , we cannot simplify . So the obstacle is that we are unable to combine these variables into a single on the left side.     "

This process typically involves two main steps:    Isolate the derivative on one side of the equation ,    Then form the product on the other side .     Common algebra techniques to achieve this product include:   Sums ➜ Products     Exponents ➜ Products  ,    Fractions ➜ Products  ,     To illustrate this, consider the following warm-up examples.   Warm-Up Examples  Show that the differential equations are separable.     To show this equation is seperable, we convert by factoring out the common :        This time we isolate first, then factor out :        First, isolate : then convert :        At first glance, this doesn't look separable because of the , but applying we get:      The next set of examples require a bit more work to show separability.   Challenging Examples  Show that the differential equations are separable.     Since the variables in this equation are and , the separable form will look like .  To get there, we isolate first:   Now, we split the fraction so that and can be separated: So, the equation is separable .        This example uses a little of everything we discussed, so strap in.  Noticing that the equation is first-order, we start by isolating    Next, we can rewrite the exponent in the numerator as a product and recognize that there is a common factor in the numerator .  From here, we write the result as a product of fractions, , and the equation is now clearly separable .     Learning to recognize when an equation is separable is the first step in applying the method of separation of variables, which we will discuss in the next section.    Steps to Show Separable   Suppose you want to show that the differential equation is separable.  Match the scrambled tasks (on the left) to the order that it should be performed to show it is separable.     check the equation is 1st-order  The first task is to ...    move to the left side via subtraction  Then, the second task is to ...    factor out a common factor of on the left side  The final step is to ...    check the equation is linear  integrate both sides  divide both sides by      📖❓ Match the Needed Technique   Match the technique needed to show each equation is separable.  Drag the technique, on the left, to the equation, on the right.    Review it                                                                    How can the equation, below, be rewritten in separable form?            Incorrect. This rewriting does not separate the variables effectively.           Incorrect. This form still combines and terms in a way that is not separable.           Correct! This form separates the variables, making it possible to identify whether the equation is separable.      This equation is not separable.    Correct!

This equation is not separable because the terms involving and are not easily separable onto different sides of the equation. In this case, the method of separation of variables cannot be applied because the terms involving and are not easily separable.     Where Does Separation of Variables Come From?   Explain why you think separation of variables is an appropriate name for the method in this chapter.     The method of separation of variables is named as such because it involves isolating all terms involving to one side and all terms involving to the other. This effectively separates the variables and onto different sides of the equation, allowing for the integration of each side independently. The name \"separation of variables\" reflects the process of isolating the variables onto different sides of the equation.     What Could go Wrong?   Ignoring the fact that the following equation is not separable, suppose we applied the separation of variables process to . What breaks down leading up to the integrate step ?     The next step in the process says to divide both sides by the function of . In our case, this is , so we would get . Now, multiplying both sides by and integrating would yield . The integral on the left side is fine, but the integral on the right side is where the process breaks down since the integral wants to integrate with respect to . Therefore, you are stuck unless you knew as a function of . However, if this were the case, you would have already solved the problem!     Implicit vs. Explicit   Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield explicit solutions, while others yield implicit solutions. Give your interpretation of the difference between an implicit and explicit solution. Provide an example of an implicitly and explicitly defined function.     An implicit solution is one where the relationship between and is not explicitly defined. For example, the solution is an implicit solution. An explicit solution, on the other hand, is one where is defined explicitly as a function of . For example, the solution is an explicit solution.     Thinking in Cases   All first order linear differential equations with dependent variable, , can be written in the form where and are known functions of . What must be true about and for a first-order linear differential equation to be separable?   Make some general assumptions about and and think about how you could break this question into different cases about what and could be to guarantee separability.      Attempting to isolate the derivative on the left, we get: Since, and can only contain the variable or constants, then this form is only separable in the following cases:  Both and are constant.

This equation is not separable because the terms involving and are not easily separable onto different sides of the equation. In this case, the method of separation of variables cannot be applied because the terms involving and are not easily separable.     Where Does Separation of Variables Come From?   Explain why you think separation of variables is an appropriate name for the method in this chapter.     The method of separation of variables is named as such because it involves isolating all terms involving to one side and all terms involving to the other. This effectively separates the variables and onto different sides of the equation, allowing for the integration of each side independently. The name \"separation of variables\" reflects the process of isolating the variables onto different sides of the equation.     What Could go Wrong?   Ignoring the fact that the following equation is not separable, suppose we applied the separation of variables process to . What breaks down leading up to the integrate step ?     The next step in the process says to divide both sides by the function of . In our case, this is , so we would get . Now, multiplying both sides by and integrating would yield . The integral on the left side is fine, but the integral on the right side is where the process breaks down since the integral wants to integrate with respect to . Therefore, you are stuck unless you knew as a function of . However, if this were the case, you would have already solved the problem!     Implicit vs. Explicit   Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield explicit solutions, while others yield implicit solutions. Give your interpretation of the difference between an implicit and explicit solution. Provide an example of an implicitly and explicitly defined function.     An implicit solution is one where the relationship between and is not explicitly defined. For example, the solution is an implicit solution. An explicit solution, on the other hand, is one where is defined explicitly as a function of . For example, the solution is an explicit solution.     Thinking in Cases   All first order linear differential equations with dependent variable, , can be written in the form where and are known functions of . What must be true about and for a first-order linear differential equation to be separable?   Make some general assumptions about and and think about how you could break this question into different cases about what and could be to guarantee separability.      Attempting to isolate the derivative on the left, we get: Since, and can only contain the variable or constants, then this form is only separable in the following cases:  Both and are constant.

For instance, to solve , we complete the square by adding (since ) to both sides: , which gives a single perfect square:   This grouping is helpful because a square root immediately reveals the solution.  Some first-order differential equations benefit from a similar idea. Instead of forming a single square, we aim to group the left-hand side as a single derivative .  For example, take the equation: .  As you will soon learn, multiplying both sides by actually completes the product rule in a similar way that adding completed the square: .  Applying the product rule in reverse, gives a single derivative on the left: .  This new form makes solving easier since direct integration can be used.  This process of multiplying by the right function to complete the product rule is the heart of the integrating factor method and it raises an important question:  How do we know what function to multiply by?

  "body": " The Integrating Factor  In the last section, we explored how rewriting the left-hand side of a differential equation as a single derivative (i.e., completing the product rule ) made it easier to solve. But here's the catch: most equations aren't initially set-up for this.  For example, take the equation   It's not a complete product rule, but it can be if we multiply both sides by : .  Now, we can reverse product rule on the left, giving us , which is just one integration away from the solution. The function, , that we multiplied onto the equation is known as the integrating factor .   But, where did come from? Can we always find such a function? How?   Finding the Right Function to Multiply  To figure out where came from, let's return to our example:   To complete the product rule, we need to multiply the equation by a function. We don't yet know what that function is, so let's call it and multiply both sides of the equation by it: .  If completes a product rule on the left, then if should match the form . Setting the labels: , so , and looking for functions and that complete the pattern, we match as follows: .  This suggests that , and taking the derivative of the first of these means we also have .  Setting the two versions of equal, an interesting equation emerges: .  📌 Note  The absolute value disappears because any sign change is absorbed into the constant .   That's a differential equation. And since it's separable, we know how to solve it: .  When selecting an integrating factor, we are free to choose any nonzero value for . However, we usually choose to keep things simple, so, our integrating factor is:   This is the function we were looking for. It completes the product rule, allowing us to write the left-hand side of the equation as a single derivative and solve by integration.   Reading Questions   📖❓ Integrating Factor Dependence   In the example above, we derived the integrating factor for the equation . Based on this derivation, select the correct ending to the statement:  Of the values in the equation, the integrating factor depends on .       only the value .   Correct! The integrating factor depends only on the coefficient of , which is .     only the value .   Incorrect.

The integrating factor does depend on the coefficient of , which is .       📖❓ Integrating Factor Equation   To solve the differential equation , you multiply both sides by the integrating factor, , to get Which separable differential equation do you solve to find ?      Correct!     Incorrect     Incorrect. This is not a separable equation.     Incorrect. This equation has too many variables.        A Formula for Any Equation  In the last example, we figured out the integrating factor by treating the left-hand side as a product rule and labeling the parts. Let's now extend that reasoning to any first-order linear differential equation.  We'll start with defining the standard form for these equations:   Standard Form (First-Order, Linear)   A differential equation is said to be in standard form if it can be written as: where and are known functions of the independent variable , and is the unknown function (dependent variable) we want to find.

  "body": " Slope Fields   When working with first-order differential equations, you can gain insight into solutions without fully solving them. By focusing on how the solutions change, you can use a slope field to visualize the path of any potential solution.  A slope field visually represents the slopes that a solution curve must follow at each point in the plane, shown as short arrows pointing the way a solution would travel—like a leaf carried by a stream.  The pattern created by a slope field provides a visual representation of the family of solutions to the differential equation. A slope field doesn't show just one solution—it shows them all. From any starting point, a unique curve threads through, always guided by the tiny arrows.    From Equation to Slope  Every first-order differential equation combines , , and . By rearranging terms, we can always write it as: where collects all terms. For example:   When it is possible to isolate , we write:   Here is the slope generator : give it any point and it outputs the slope the solution must have there. For instance, if and ,   Since is the tangent slope of at , this number tells you the direction the graph is heading at .   Quick Slope Check   For , find the slope at .    Rearranging gives , so .

Sketching a Slope Field  To sketch a slope field by hand:   Select a small grid of points in the -plane.  Compute at each point.  Draw a short line segment at the point with that slope.   For example, take Computing nine slopes on a grid yields:                     Sketching by hand is great for intuition but tedious when you need more points. Computer-generated slope fields fill in the gaps, revealing a dense web of arrows that paints the full picture. In , the solution curve through flows smoothly along the arrows, like an object carried by a current.       Slope field for    A slope field turns an equation into a navigational chart. Each arrow is an instruction every solution must obey. The entire field represents the whole family of solutions, letting you spot patterns in how solutions behave, without ever solving for explicitly.

  "body": " Equilibrium Solutions   Autonomous equations tell us that the direction of change depends only on the current state, not the current time. That pattern shows up in their slope fields as horizontal stripes of identical slope behavior. Now we'll focus on one especially important feature of those fields: the horizontal lines where the slope is zero. Along those lines, the system simply stops changing. These constant solutions are called equilibrium solutions .    Flat Lines and Fixed Behavior  Consider the slope field for the autonomous equation:  . Since this is autonomous, the slope depends only on . At certain -values, something special happens: the slope becomes exactly zero.       Slope field for    In the slope field, those points appear as rows of perfectly horizontal segments . That's no accident—where , the solution curve doesn't move. If a solution starts there, it stays there forever. These flat lines are the equilibrium solutions .  To find them, we set (the slope) to zero and solve for . In this example: So the equilibrium solutions are the constant functions and .  These constant solutions act like anchors in the system: other solutions either drift toward them or get pushed away. We'll explore that stability behavior in the next section.   📖❓ Observing the Slope Field   Look at the slope field below. Which constant solutions do you see? In other words, what -values have perfectly horizontal segments?                    What the Slope Field Tells You  What about the other values of ? Between the equilibria at and , the slopes are positive. For example: so the slope is positive and solutions rise. The slope field shows this: between and , the little segments tilt upward.  Above , things flip. Try : which is negative, so solutions decrease. The slope field confirms it—segments tilt downward. The same downward pull appears below .  The slope field acts like a behavior map : equilibrium solutions mark where the system is still, while the tilts around them reveal which way nearby solutions move.    How to Find Equilibrium Solutions  Finding equilibrium solutions is always the same quick process:   Assuming is constant and , then and so: .  The equation is algebraic. Solve it for .

Consider: Assuming , thenthis equation becaomes: So, and the equilibrium solutions are:   Mark these on the slope field with horizontal lines.

  "title": "Classifying Equilibrium Solutions",
  "body": " Classifying Equilibrium Solutions   Equilibrium solutions mark the places where a system comes to rest. But not all equilibrium solutions are alike, some attract nearby solutions, others repel them, and some do a bit of both. In this section, we'll learn how to classify these points by examining the slope field, the sign of , and a tool called a phase line .    Types of Equilibria  Suppose is an equilibrium solution of an autonomous equation . If you nudge a solution slightly above or below , it might drift back, move away, or react differently on each side. What it does determines the type of equilibrium it is.  There are three common types:   Stable (sink): Solutions move toward the equilibrium from both sides.  Unstable (source): Solutions move away from the equilibrium on both sides.  Semi-stable (node): Solutions move toward the equilibrium on one side and away from it on the other.   In a slope field, a sink looks like arrows converging toward a horizontal line, a source shows arrows diverging away, and a node is a mix: converging on one side, diverging on the other. Next, we'll look at different ways to determine these behaviors.    Classification via the Phase Line  Slope fields show a lot of information at once, but for autonomous equations we can simplify. Since the slope depends only on , we can compress the slope field into a simple vertical diagram of just -values. This is called a phase line .  On a phase line:   Equilibria are marked with solid dots.  Regions where get upward arrows.  Regions where get downward arrows.   The arrows summarize how changes: whether solutions are rising or falling. Follow the arrows up or down and you'll see where solutions eventually settle—or whether they're pushed away.   Slope Field (left) and Phase Line (right) for             Growth and Decay   Find and classify the equilibrium solutions of the autonomous equation:     First, set : giving equilibrium solutions at and .

We test the sign of in each:          Region  Test Point   Sign of       Positive       Negative       Positive              Now we can classify the equilibria based on the phase line:  Solutions move away from , so it is a source .  Solutions move toward , so it is a sink .       📖❓ Match the Equilibria     Suppose an autonomous equation has three equilibrium solutions at .

Phase Line              Sink     Source     Node    None of these       Classification via the Linearization Method  There's another way to classify equilibria: use a quick calculus check on .  Notice in that the sign of flips as you pass through an equilibrium. The pattern of that flip tells you what kind of point it is:   At the source , , goes from negative → positive (increases).  At the sink , , goes from positive → negative (decreases).   The important observation is that increases through sources and decreases through sinks. This is true in general, so we can classify equilibrium solutions by looking at the sign of at the equilibrium points.                 If , then is an equilibrium. To classify it:   If , it's a sink (stable).  If , it's a source (unstable).  If , the test is inconclusive—you'll need more investigation.   This is called the linearization method , because it looks at the linear (slope) behavior of near the equilibrium.    Consider the autonomous equation: Find and classify the equilibrium solutions using linearization.    First, solve : so and are equilibria.

  "title": "Parameter Analysis",
  "body": " Parameter Analysis      Many mathematical models include one or more parameters —constants that represent things like birth rates, drug dosage, resource limits, or physical constants. These parameters aren't just placeholders—they often control the qualitative behavior of the system. Small changes in a parameter's value can cause major shifts in the solution's behavior. Understanding those changes is the goal of parameter analysis .  In this section, we focus on the most important modeling insight: how equilibria and their stability depend on parameters . When a parameter crosses a critical threshold, the model's behavior can shift dramatically—this is called a bifurcation .    Bifurcation Analysis  A bifurcation is a qualitative change in the system's dynamics caused by varying a parameter. In the context of differential equations, it usually means that the number or stability of equilibrium solutions changes at certain critical values.  Consider the one-parameter system: where is a parameter. As changes:   Existing equilibria may change from stable to unstable (or vice versa).  New equilibria may appear or disappear altogether.  In some cases, the long-term behavior of the entire system changes.   The basic workflow for bifurcation analysis is:   Find equilibria: Solve for in terms of the parameter .  Classify stability: Compute at each equilibrium. The sign determines whether the equilibrium is a sink (stable) or a source (unstable).  Track changes: See how the equilibria and their stability change as varies. Identify critical values where the behavior flips.   Consider the parameterized system: .  First, we find the equilibria: .  To see how the equilibria depend on , solve for equilibrium:  For : two equilibria exist ( ).  For : a single equilibrium ( ).  For : no real equilibria.    Stability analysis shows that one branch is stable and the other is unstable when . The bifurcation diagram reveals a collision of equilibria at , called a saddle-node bifurcation .  The results are often summarized in a bifurcation diagram —a picture showing:  The equilibria plotted against .  Solid lines for stable equilibria, dashed lines for unstable ones.  Critical parameter values where the diagram changes shape.     shows the bifurcation diagram for the previous example.   Bifurcation diagram for      Bifurcation diagrams are a cornerstone of modeling—they show, at a glance, how a system's behavior shifts as conditions change.    Why Parameter Analysis Matters in Modeling  Why should we care about bifurcations? Because in applied problems, parameters represent real things : a harvest rate in an ecology model, a dosage in a drug model, or an investment threshold in an economics model. Changing those parameters changes the system.  The most important modeling insight:   Stable equilibria correspond to long-term states the system will settle into.  Bifurcation points are thresholds where those long-term states shift—suddenly and sometimes irreversibly.   For example:   In epidemiology, there's often a threshold vaccination rate: below it, disease spreads (unstable equilibrium); above it, the disease dies out (stable equilibrium).  In ecology, a critical harvest rate might push a fish population from stable sustainability to collapse.     📖❓ Parameter Analysis   Spot the Bifurcation   The model changes behavior as varies. What happens when crosses zero?     Two equilibria collide and disappear.  Correct—this is the hallmark of a saddle-node bifurcation.    The system gains an oscillation.  This model is one-dimensional; it cannot generate oscillations.    The system's slope changes sign but equilibria stay the same.  No—the set of equilibria itself changes.      "

  "body": " Logistical Models       The Logistic Model  One of the most famous autonomous differential equations is the logistic model , which describes population growth when there are limited resources. The equation is:   where is the population at time , is the growth rate, and is the carrying capacity , the maximum population that the environment can sustain.  This equation has two equilibrium points:   (extinction),  (population stabilizes at carrying capacity).   The phase line for this model shows:   At , the equilibrium is unstable, any small population increase leads to growth.  At , the equilibrium is stable, populations near this value settle toward it.  When , populations increase.  When , populations decrease.   This model captures how populations grow rapidly when small, slow down as they approach the carrying capacity, and eventually level off.   Logistic Model Analysis   Consider the logistic equation .  Identify the equilibrium points.  Sketch the phase line and classify the stability of each equilibrium.  Explain how this model describes long-term population behavior.      The equilibrium points are and .  On the phase line:   is a source (unstable).  is a sink (stable).   Populations grow when between and , and shrink when above . The model predicts eventual stabilization at the carrying capacity.    The logistic model is sometimes written in a slightly different form:   where is the carrying capacity and is the growth-rate constant. This form emphasizes that growth is proportional to both the current population and the remaining resource capacity .  This is still a first-order autonomous differential equation, but unlike the exponential model, it is nonlinear since the right-hand side is not a linear function of .  The analysis is the same: the equilibria are and . The phase line tells us their stability, just like before.   A Modified Logistic Model  Let's now consider a variation on the logistic model that includes an important ecological detail, what happens to very small populations. The standard logistic model assumes that populations always grow when small, but in reality, sparse populations can have difficulty finding mates, making growth negative at low levels.  As an example, consider pine squirrels in the Rocky Mountains. These animals are territorial, and both overcrowding and underpopulation can limit their growth:   If the population is too large , territorial conflict slows growth or even causes decline.  If the population is too small , individuals may not find mates, also resulting in decline.  If the population is exactly zero, it stays at zero forever.   Let's model this situation. We define:   = time,  = squirrel population at time ,  = growth-rate coefficient,  = carrying capacity (too large),  = sparsity threshold (too small).   We want the growth rate to satisfy the following:   if or ,  if ,  .   A function with this behavior might look like:   This is the modified logistic model . It adjusts the standard model to account for low-population risks.  Let's analyze it. The equilibrium points occur where the right-hand side equals zero:   (extinction),  (sparsity threshold),  (carrying capacity).   The phase line tells us:   is a stable equilibrium (a sink).  is an unstable equilibrium (a source).  is a stable equilibrium (a sink).   This model better captures real-world behavior by showing that small populations might go extinct if they fall below the sparsity threshold.   Modified Logistic Model Analysis  Consider the differential equation:   Find all equilibrium solutions.  Sketch the phase line and label the stability of each equilibrium.  Explain how this model improves on the standard logistic model.     Equilibrium points: , , .  Phase line summary:   is a sink (stable).  is a source (unstable).  is a sink (stable).   Between and , populations decrease. Between and , populations increase. Above , populations decrease. This reflects the idea that populations only grow when they're within a safe range, not too small and not too large.     "

No—adding a constant changes in a way that won't satisfy the DE.     Raising the solution to a power doesn't preserve the equation's behavior.      Time Shifts in Practice   A biologist models population growth with the autonomous equation They find a solution curve that fits data collected in spring.

  "body": " What is a Numerical Solution?   Most of what we've done, so far, has been focused on finding exact solutions to differential equations, like . This kind of solution is called an analytic solution , or sometimes a closed-form solution . It is valuable because it expresses as a formula-like structure that you can plug in any value of and instantly get the exact -value.  However, many differential equations, such as   simply don't have a tidy closed-form solution. In those cases, we switch tools. Instead of searching for an exact formula, we use a numerical method . A numerical method doesn't hand you as a formula—it builds an approximation , one step at a time, starting from what you know and using the differential equation to predict what happens next. The result is a numerical solution .    📖❓ Analytic Solution, AKA …  What is another name for an analytic solution?    Closed-form solution  Yes , a closed-form solution is another name for an analytic solution.    Approximate solution  No , an approximate solution refers to a numerical solution.    Continuous solution  Not all analytic solutions are continuous , and not all continuous solutions are analytic.    Systematic solution  While you may solve analytically using a systematic process, this is not a name for an analytic solution.

Analytic vs. Numerical Solutions  To see the difference between analytic and numerical solutions, consider the initial value problem:   Analytically, this equation has the elegant solution:    . With this formula, you can calculate the exact value at any time. For example, gives .          The same equation can also be solved numerically. Instead of a formula, we produce a table of -values and approximate -values:      (approx)  0.00 1.0000  0.25 1.2500  0.50 1.5625  0.75 1.9531  … …     Plot the  points           📖❓ Recognizing a Numerical Solution  When you say you've found a numerical solution to an initial value problem, what do you actually have?

  "title": "Thinking in Steps: How Euler’s Method Works One Step at a Time",
  "body": " Thinking in Steps: How Euler's Method Works One Step at a Time   This shift towards numerical approximation is not just a workaround but a powerful approach that expands our capacity to solve differential equations arising in complex systems where exact solutions are not readily derivable. Euler's method, as we will see, is the entry point into this expansive field of computational mathematics, demonstrating how straightforward concepts can approximate solutions to complex problems.    Iterative Methods—Thinking in Steps  Most numerical methods are iterative , which means they don't try to solve the whole problem at once. Instead, they repeat the same small task again and again.  That task is simple: use the information you already have to generate new information. Do it once, you get the next step. Do it a hundred times, you build a whole solution.  So, the key to understanding an iterative method is by learning its task.   📖❓ What does iterative mean?   Euler's method (and most numerical methods) are described as iterative . What does that mean in practice?     It repeats a single simple step many times to build up a solution.  Correct — iterative methods loop the same calculation to generate new information.    It always produces the exact solution in one step.  No — that's the opposite of iterative thinking. Iteration builds up an approximate solution step by step.    It skips steps and jumps straight to the final answer.  No — iterative methods never skip. They accumulate results step by step.    It uses only algebra, not calculus, to solve equations.  Not quite — Euler's method uses the slope from calculus, but applies it in a repetitive way.       Euler's Method Task  For Euler's method, the repeated task can be summed up like this:   from a known point, move to a nearby point along the direction of the slope.   Think of following a hiking trail using only a compass—you don't know exactly where the trail ends, but if you keep stepping in the right direction, you'll trace the path. In Euler's method, that direction is the slope from the differential equation.  More precisely, if is a point on the solution and you know the slope there, you can predict where the next point will be.  To understand this one step, we'll answer two guiding questions:   What does it mean to move in the direction of a slope?  Given a point, slope, and step size, what is the formula for the next point?     Moving in the Direction of a Slope  First question: What does it mean to move in the direction of a slope? Suppose you're at the point and the slope there is .  Slope is rise over run : for every unit you move horizontally ( run ), you move a certain amount vertically ( rise ). From , a slope of means that for every 2 units of run, you rise 3 units, like so: .  So moving from in a direction with slope , lands you at . See .   Rise Clarification   Rise doesn't always mean up —if the slope is negative, rise is actually a fall. We'll keep calling it rise for simplicity, but remember it might point downward.   Of course, there's nothing special about using a run of 2. We could have used (rise would then be 6) or even (rise would be ). All of the following fractions   describe the same slope, which can be visualized in .  In Euler's method, we intentionally choose a small run called the step size, . Therefore, for a small run, , you get the corresponding rise by:   So given a direction (slope) to move and the step size ( ) to take, this formula gives you the rise. Next, we'll see how this simple relationship is the core of Euler's one-step move.    Same Slope, Different Rise and Runs    Rise , run       Rise , run       Rise , run          📖❓ Calculating the Rise   Suppose the slope at a point is and you take a step size of . What is the rise over that step?      Yes — rise = slope × step size = .     That's the slope itself, not the rise for the small step.     That's the step size (run), not the rise.     Double-check the multiplication — slope × step size is much smaller.       The Movement Rule  Now that we've decided how to take a step, we can write it as a formula.  From basic geometry, a new point is just the old point plus the changes:  . Euler's method sets the run to the step size and the rise to . Substituting those gives the update rule:  . This single equation captures the whole one-step task: start at the current point, find the slope, take a step of size in that direction, and you land at the next point. Euler's method is simply this step repeated many times.   📖❓ Understanding the Movement Formula   What does the term represent in Euler's movement rule?     The change in over the chosen step.  Correct — the slope tells the direction, and scales it into a small rise.    The next value.  No — the update is handled separately as .    The slope of the entire solution curve.  Careful — this is the slope at a single point, not the whole curve.    The error made by Euler's method in each step.  Not true — is the predicted rise, not the error.       📖❓ Big Picture of Euler's Step   Which statement best describes what Euler's method does one step at a time ?     From a current point, it uses the slope to predict the next point.  Correct — Euler's method is nothing more than this step, done over and over.    It finds one term of the exact general solution.  No — finding terms of the solution would be an analytic method.    It moves to a nearby point on the solution curve.  No — if you knew where the solution curve was, you would already have the solution to the equation.    It approximates the roots of the characteristic equation.  No — Euler's approximates points of the solution, not the roots of the characteristic equation.     "

  "body": " Euler's Method: The Full Process   In the previous section, we zoomed in on the single step at the heart of Euler's method: move forward by a small amount in , and adjust by times the slope. Now we'll zoom out. By repeating that step again and again, we can march across an interval, building an approximate solution point by point.    A Concrete Step Through Euler's Method  Before writing any formulas, it helps to see what Euler's Method feels like. Think of Euler's method like crossing a landscape with only a compass. You know where you start. At each step, you check your direction (the slope from the differential equation), take a small stride that way, then check again. That back-and-forth of step, check, adjust is the rhythm of the method.   The Goal  Suppose we have the initial value problem . Let's approximate the solution at the equally-spaced -values: . This tells us that our goal is to approximate the -values at the following points:  . Luckily, the first value is just the initial condition, , so we add it to the list: . Starting at , Euler's method finds the rest of the points, one-by-one.    Approximating the Next Point  From , we need to get to . Clearly, the run is , but we also need the slope for our movement direction. This comes directly from the differential equation: .  Moving from with a slope of and a run of is given by: .  Therefore, the next point is and our approximation list becomes: .    Approximating the Rest of the Points  To get the third and fourth point, we just repeat what we just did.  At , we get the slope from: .  Using this slope and the same run, we get the third point: .  Now we are at and the slope we move this time is: .  and our final point is given by: .  With this, our approximation is now complete: .  A plot of the process is given in .   (left) Euler's method approximation of the solution to with step size . (right) Plot of each point in the approximation.         (approx)                                        Euler's Method  Now let's generalize the concrete example. As we do, check the footnotes for the concrete version of each equation and step.  Consider an initial value problem:  .  We divide into equally spaced values (a distance apart):      Using the shorthand , our goal is to approximate the points:      The first point, , is known since it is the initial condition. The remaining points are approximated using the movement rule , where cur is and new is :  . The slope is found from in the differential equation, so the rule becomes:   Extracting just the -coordinate, gives the update rule for Euler's method:   That's it. All of the values in the table of can be found with this formula.   Match Euler's Method Parts to their Meaning   Assume the current approximation using Euler's Method is denoted by . In this context, match the mathematical expression with its meaning.    These pairings are essential when converting a piecewise function into unit step form. The form you choose depends entirely on where each piece is active.      The value of the next approximation.     The value of the previous approximation.     The distance between and .     The slope of the solution at the current approximation.     The value of the current approximation.     The rise (or fall) in the value from the current approximation to the next approximation.      Euler's Method  Given an initial value problem   approximate the solution with the following steps:   Select step size  Choosing a step size determines where for .   Apply Euler's update rule  For to , compute      Desipte being based on relatively simple idea, Euler's method reveals something profound: with nothing more than a starting point and slope formula, you can approximate a solution that no closed-form equation could describe.    Examples   Euler's Method Example   Use Euler's method to approximate the solution to the differential equation over the interval with a step size of .     . The step size is , so the approximation locations are .   . The initial condition gives the first value in our approximation, .

Find the analytical solution to this equation using the method of separation of variables.    Use Euler's method with a step size of to approximate the solution at .    Compare the analytical solution with the numerical approximation obtained from Euler's method.       To solve the differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we separate the variables as follows: Integrating both sides gives: Exponentiating both sides results in: Since the initial condition, , gives , the analytical solution is:   Next, we apply Euler's method to approximate the solution at . The general formula for Euler's method is: where and . So, we can update the formula as:   For , we contruct the following table:                                            Since , the approximation we are looking for is .  Comparing this with the analytical solution at , we see the true value is: Although there is some error between the two values, it is more due to the step size we chose, rather than the method itself. A smaller step size would yield a more accurate approximation. For example, using gives the approximation: .     Example: Euler's Method with   Use Euler's method to approximate the solution to over to using step size .    The formula is:            0 0.0 -2.0 -3.0    1 0.5 -3.0 -3.0    2 1.0 -3.0 -1.5    Thus, the approximate values are:     Euler's method runs on an intuitive idea: use the slope at each point to predict the next point. It's simple, but that simplicity is its strength. This method is often the first stepping stone into the world of numerical methods and the same pattern of predict, step, repeat forms the backbone of many other techniques.   "

  "title": "The LHCC Equation",
  "body": " The LHCC Equation   Before learning how to solve Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) differential equations, it's important to identify these equations and understand the nature of their structure. In this section, we'll define what it means for a differential equation to be homogeneous, review how constant coefficients affect the form of the equation, and formally define what qualifies as an LHCC equation.    Linear Differential Equations & Forcing Functions  Recall that a differential equation is called linear if it only contains linear terms, meaning the dependent variable and its derivatives appear to the first power without multiplication or composed with one another.  An equation is nonlinear nonlinear if it includes terms like , , , or , where the dependent variable is raised to a power or multiplied by one of its derivatives.  A general -th order linear differential equation looks like this:   The coefficients and the right-hand side depend only on the independent variable, which we're calling . While we previously referred to as a free term, in this context, it is known as the forcing function .  Forcing functions are not always easily identifiable on the right-hand side of a differential equation. Sometimes, terms and their derivatives may be mixed in, or parts of the forcing function may appear on the left.  For example, the equation the forcing function is not immediately clear. Rearranging it into standard form: reveals that the forcing function is .   📖❓ Identifying the Forcing Function   What is the forcing function in the differential equation?       Correct! The forcing function is the entire right-hand side of the equation.  `   This is the coefficient of the term, not the forcing function.     This is only part of the forcing function.     This is only part of the forcing function.       Constant Coefficients  A linear differential equation has constant coefficients if all the coefficients are constants rather than functions of the independent variable .  So, a linear differential equation with constant coefficients looks like:  . Here are a few examples of linear equations with constant coefficients:  , And here are some that do not have constant coefficients:  .  📖❓ Identifying Constant Coefficient Equations   Select all the linear differential equations that have constant coefficients.           Correct! All coefficients are constant.           Incorrect. The coefficient of is , which is not constant.           Correct! All coefficients are constant.           Incorrect. The coefficient is not a constant.        Homogeneous  A linear differential equation is homogeneous if the right-hand side is zero—that is, there is no forcing term. Otherwise, it is nonhomogeneous .  For example, the following equations are homogeneous:   These are nonhomogeneous because of the (boxed) right-hand side:    📖❓ Identifying Homogeneous Equations   Which of the following equations is homogeneous?         Correct! The right-hand side is zero, so the equation is homogeneous.         Incorrect. This equation looks homogeneous, but homogeneity only applies to linear equations.         Incorrect. The equation has a non-zero free term, making it non-homogeneous.         Incorrect. The right-hand side has a non-zero function of , so this is non-homogeneous.        The LHCC Equation  Putting it all together, we arrive at the definition of an LHCC equation.    A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) has the form:   where all coefficients are constants.    The following equations are examples of LHCC equations:  .   🤔💭 Reading Questions   🤔💭 Matching Equations with Properties   Match each differential equation to its correct classification.

  "title": "Exponential Solutions",
  "body": " Exponential Solutions   Now that we can identify LHCC equations, it's time to ask a deeper question: what kinds of functions satisfy these equations? As it turns out, exponential functions are not just one possible answer, they are the natural solution.  In this section, we'll explore what makes exponentials so special. You'll see why other functions fail to work, why exponentials succeed, and how this leads us to a powerful tool called the characteristic equation .

Incorrect. & ARE NOT like terms and cannot be combined by addition.     Incorrect. & ARE NOT like terms and cannot be combined by addition.       Motivating the Exponential Solution  Consider the simple linear homogeneous constant coefficient differential equation: .  For the moment, forget that it is a differential equation and imagine that it is just two functions that simplify to zero after subtraction. That is, they cancelled out with each other. Algebra tells you that only like-terms simplify via subtraction. For example, since all three are like-terms. However, does not simplify at all since none are like-terms.   Logically, if is the solution, then this equation says and must be like-terms since they subtract to zero. This leads to the next big question:   What function is a like-term with its derivative?   You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is another exponential function. For example, if , then , which are like-terms. This unique property makes exponentials ideal candidates for solutions.  To illustrate this, let's substitute different functions into a first-order LHCC equation and see which ones cancel.    Case 1:       Case 2:       Case 3:      Only the exponential function produces like-terms that cancel perfectly. Again, suggesting that exponential functions are ideal solutions to LHCC equations.   📖❓ Valid Function Choices   Consider the differential equation, where is a constant.  Logically explain why it is impossible for to be a solution to this equation no matter what value takes.      Multiple Exponential Solutions   Verify that and are solutions to the differential equation   but that , , and are not.    First, let's check the first two exponential functions:                  As you can see, the exponential functions produce like-terms that cancel out and simplify to zero.  Let's see what happens when we plug in non-exponential functions:                  In this case, the non-exponential functions produce non-like-terms that cannot be simplified and are not solutions.  Finally, let's check the exponential function, :          In this case, we get like-terms, but the coefficients do not sum to zero and the terms do not cancel. Therefore, is not a solution.    These examples show that exponentials are the only functions that reliably cancel out to yield zero when substituted into an LHCC equation. Even among exponentials, only those with specific exponents will satisfy a given equation. Next, we'll introduce the characteristic equation, an algebraic tool that helps us identify exactly which exponential functions will work.    The Characteristic Equation   We now know that exponential functions are strong candidates for solutions to LHCC equations. But how do we find the values of that work? The answer lies in forming a polynomial equation called the characteristic equation .   Let's try this with a few concrete examples. First, suppose  . Substituting gives   Since , the equation reduces to   This algebraic equation, , is the characteristic equation . It tells us that is a solution.  For second-order equations, we follow the same substitution process. For example, for   we substitute into , , and , resulting in   Setting the polynomial equal to zero gives the characteristic equation:   Solving this gives   so the general solution is    📖❓ Match the Characteristic Equation   Match each characteristic equation to its differential equation.

For this case, the characteristic equation is the quadratic    Solving this equation using the quadratic formula yields:   Each root corresponds to an exponential solution—either or . These are called the fundamental solutions of the differential equation.    The General Solution  Once we have the fundamental solutions, the superposition principle tells us that   is a solution to for any constants and .

This issue relates to linear dependence , which also depends on the interval where the solutions are defined.   To create a second, independent solution, we multiply the second term by , giving:   This guarantees complete general solution with independent terms. There are three distinct scenarios to consider, based on the discriminant of the characteristic equation:   Each case leads to a different form of the solution, broken down as follows.    Case 1 : Real, Non-Repeating Solutions  If is positive, then characteristic equation has the two unequal real solutions:  , so the general solution is  .

Below, we will outline some common approaches    Factoring  Some high-degree characteristic polynomials can be factored by hand using classic algebraic techniques. Factoring is the fastest way to solve these problems when it works. We'll start by reviewing common methods of factoring and apply them to characteristic equations that appear in LHCC differential equations.  Here are a few algebraic strategies you may find helpful:  🧮 Factoring Techniques                                Let's now apply these tools to solve higher-order LHCC equations by factoring their characteristic equations.   Solving LHCC Equations by Factoring the Characteristic Equation   These examples show how to find the general solution to higher-order LHCC equations using a variety of factoring techniques to find the roots of the characteristic equation.   1.     The characteristic equation is:   Applying the difference of squares:       2.    The characteristic equation is:   Factoring out the common term , followed by a differences of squares gives:         3.     This factors as a difference of squares twice:         4.    The characteristic equation is:   Use the substitution, , to reveal a quadratic in disguise:   Reverse the substitution, , back into :         5.    The characteristic equation is:   Take out and use standard factoring:         6.    The characteristic equation is:   We can factor this by grouping and recognizing a sum of cubes:            Rational Root Theorem  When the characteristic polynomial is hard to factor by inspection, the Rational Root Theorem provides a systematic way to search for rational (fractional) solutions. Once you find a root, you can use polynomial division to reduce the polynomial to a lower degree. From there, you can repeat the process or apply other factoring techniques.  While this method is reliable, it can be tedious by hand and prone to errors. That's why technology often comes in handy.    Using Technology: Factoring High-Degree Polynomials  Not all characteristic polynomials can be factored easily — and some can't be factored at all using simple algebra. In these cases, it's perfectly reasonable to turn to technology.  Computer algebra systems (CAS), online factoring tools, and symbolic solvers can quickly find the roots of even complicated polynomials. Once you have the roots, you can build the general solution using the framework you learned earlier.  For example, suppose you want to solve the following LHCC equation:  . The first step is to write down the characteristic equation:   This is challenging to solve by hand, but we can use the tool below to factor it.  Type 2*r^4 + 9*r^3 + r^2 - 21*r + 9 into the text box and press enter.   Polynomial Factoring Calculator Directions   Directions:  Enter a polynomial in the box below.  Use r for the variable, * for multiplication, and ^ for exponents.  Press enter to see the factored form and approximate values.  Note: It only factors polynomials with fractional (rational) roots.       After entering the polynomial, you should see the factored form:   From here the roots are easily identified as:   Therefore, the general solution is:    📖❓ Solving a High-Order LHCC Equation With a Factoring Tool   Find the general solution to the LHCC equation by using the factoring tool to find the characteristic roots.      Characteristic Roots:   General Solution:   Use c1 , c2 , c3 as the arbitrary constants of integration.                  First, write down the characteristic equation: . Plugging this into to the factoring tool shows that it factors as . Solving for , we get . Therefore, the general solution is: .       Using Technology: Approximating Roots  Some characteristic equations are too messy to factor, even with software. When this happens, a numerical root finder can provide decimal approximations of the roots, allowing us to write down the structure of the general solution.  Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:   The characteristic equation is: This polynomial has no obvious factoring pattern, and standard techniques fail. Fortunately, numerical approximation tools can help.  Try entering r^5 - 4*r^3 + 3*r^2 - 1 into the same factoring tool above. You should get the following approximations for three real roots:   and the complex pair:   using the standard root-to-solution rules, the general solution is:    📖❓ Decimal Roots in the General Solution   Suppose you find the characteristic roots are approximately .  Which of the following best describes the general solution?        Correct! The real root gives a standalone exponential, and the complex pair contributes an oscillatory term with the same .       Incorrect. The sine and cosine must be multiplied by .       Incorrect. This would be appropriate if were a triple root.       This mixes formats and includes a non-real exponential.     Regardless of the method you choose to find the roots, the general solution is relatively easy to construct once you have them.   "

Now we can see what comes of the first initial condition  Now we can use the other initial condition  Notice that the resulting equations, (\\ref{eq13}) and (\\ref{eq14}) constitute a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, and we should be able to solve for the unknown and . There are multiple ways to achieve this. One possibility is to solve for in equation (\\ref{eq13}) and then substitute into equation (\\ref{eq14}) as follows. Hence, we have the solution           or         Beyond the Basics  The General Solution to First-Order LHCC Equations   Derive the general solution to a first order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equation of the form: , where are constants.    The characteristic equation this equation is .  So, the only fundamental solution to this equation is: .  Therefore, the general solution must be where is an arbitrary constant.     Suppose an LHCC equation has as a solution. Can you conclude anything specific about the structure of such an LHCC equation?    Boundary Value Problems   Solve the following boundary value problems. Explain whetheryou found a unique solution, an infinite number of solutions, or no solution.     Consider the following differential equation: .  Notice that instead of initial conditions at only, there is one at . This is call a boundary-valued problem (BVP) because it has conditions over two different -values. Now, for this equation find the following, if possible:    General solution.  This DE is linear, homogeneous, and has constant coefficients, so we can start by solving the characteristic equation. Thus, the general solution is      (o )      The solution with boundary conditions: and .  We can begin with the general solution we found previously. When we apply the first condition we have the following. And using the second condition yields the following. Hence, the (unique) particular solution is     the unique solution i       The solution with boundary conditions: and .  We can begin with the general solution we found previously. When we apply the first condition we have the following. And using the second condition yields the following. In this case, the first condition leads t while the second condition leads t These cannot both be true, so there is no solution .    no solution      The solution with boundary conditions: and .  We can begin with the general solution we found previously. When we apply the first condition we have the following. And using the second condition yields the following. In this case, both of the conditions lead t and we don't learn anything abou Thus could still take on any value, and therefore there are an infinite number of solutions of the form     there are an infinite number of solutions of the for          If possible, solve the following boundary value problem:    We begin by verifying the following: the DE is linear,  the DE is homogeneous, and  the DE has constant coefficients. Since all of the conditions are true, we can safely proceed to find the general solution. We write down and then solve the characteristic equation, as follows. Since an are distinct, real roots, the general solution is given by Now we can see what comes of the first boundary condition  Now we can use the other boundary condition  Notice that the resulting equations, (\\ref{eq11}) and (\\ref{eq12}) constitute a system of two linear equations in two unknowns, and we should be able to solve for the unknown an . There are multiple ways to achieve this. One possibility is to solve for in equation (\\ref{eq11}) and then substitute into equation (\\ref{eq12}) as follows. Hence, we have the solution             Show why is needed in the general solution for repeated roots of the CE             "

  "title": "The LNCC Equation",
  "body": " The LNCC Equation   You already know that a linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equation has the form:   All the terms are on the left, and the right-hand side is zero. This equation is called homogeneous because the solution only includes terms that cancel each other out.  A linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation looks almost the same, except the right-hand side is now a function:   The function is called the forcing function because it introduces an external input that forces the system to respond in a particular way.    📖❓ Homogeneous vs Nonhomogeneous   Which structure or property of a differential equation separates homogeneous from nonhomogeneous equations?      The presence of a non-zero forcing function.    Correct! A non-zero free term on the right-hand side of the equation indicates a nonhomogeneous equation.      The dependent variable.    Incorrect. The dependent variable is present in both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations.      The order of the equation.    Incorrect. Both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations can have the same order.      The linearity of the equation.    Incorrect. Both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations can be linear.       Guessing a Solution that Accounts for the Forcing Function   Note: For brevity, we will refer to the left side of equation as 🍄. Also, when we say plug into 🍄 , we mean calculate and substitute , , into , then simplify.   Imagine you had to make your best guess as to which function, , satisfies the equation  . Remember, after differentiating your guess and plugging it into 🍄, all terms must simplify to . That is,  . Logically, for the sum of three terms to simplify to , they must share a similar structure as (i.e., a degree polynomial). or contain terms that completely cancel out, but we will ignore these for now.    📖❓ Select the most appropriate solution   Based on this logic, which function is the only possible candidate for the solution to the LNCC equation?  .  Hint: Think about the type of functions you need to add together to get .            Incorrect. This function does not resemble the forcing function.           Incorrect. Plugging into will not give you an term you need to match the forcing function, .           Correct! This 3rd degree polynomial has the same polynomial structure as the forcing function, .           Incorrect. Plugging into will leave you with an term that does not exist in the forcing function, .      In this context, a similar function-type to means our guess should also be a degree polynomial. Since we don't know which one, we use the general degree form:   Plugging this into 🍄 and taking some derivatives, we get   This is not , but maybe we can find and values that get us there. Setting the expression equal to , we have   Matching the and , gives us the system:   Substituting and into completes the solution:     Confirming our Guess  Let's double-check that the function, , we found really satisfies the equation.   This confirms as a solution. In fact, it is the most important solution because it accounts for the specific forcing function and must be included in every solution to equation . Such solutions are called particular solutions , but they are only part of the whole story.    The Hidden Parts of Nonhomogeneous Solutions  We established that the particular solution, , is what you plug into 🍄 to get . However, there could be additional terms you can plug into 🍄 that cancel out after taking derivatives and simplifying. Specifically,   We already know how to find these functions since they are just the solutions to the homogeneous version of the same equation:   This LHCC equation is solved using its characteristic equation:   This homogeneous solution, we'll call , is given by   and is the other half of LNCC solution. They provide the terms that cancel out when plugged into 🍄 and have no impact on the forcing function at all.    Combining the Parts Into a General Solution  To summarize, the general solution of equation consists of two parts:  The homogeneous part: (canceling terms), and  The particular part: (account for )  and we write it as the sum of these parts:  . Finally, let's see how the different parts of the general solution behave when plugged into the left side of the equation. First, let's plug in    and regroup the and terms:   Now, we will now show that the homogeneous terms, 1️⃣, simplify to zero:  Next, we will show that the particular terms, 2️⃣, simplify to :   So, adding the results of 1️⃣ and 2️⃣, leaves us with the forcing function, .     The General Solution to LNCC Equations  Let's summarize what we've learned so far:   ✳️ LNCC General Solution Structure   A linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation has the form:   Its general solution is built from two parts:      is the solution to the corresponding homogeneous (LHCC) equation:    the particular solution that produces the forcing function .      📖❓ Contructing the General Solution   Suppose the homogeneous and particular solutions of an LNCC equation are given by . Select the general solution for such an equation.       .    Incorrect. This is only the particular solution, not the complete general solution.       .    Incorrect. One of the terms in this expression is incorrect.       .    Correct! The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions.       .    Incorrect. You do not multiply the particular solution by a constant.      Here's a quick example to help solidify this concept.  Finding the general solution, given    Find the general solution to the differential equation given that the particular solution is known to be .     The general solution has the form:   Since is given, we only need to solve the homogeneous equation:   Using the characteristic equation:   The homogeneous solution is:   Therefore, the general solution is:     While the structure of LNCC solutions is now clear, actually determining requires a systematic approach. The next section introduces the Method of Undetermined Coefficients, a technique for efficiently constructing when has a specific form.    🤔💭 Reading Questions   🤔💭 Role of the Particular Solution   Which statement best describes the role of the particular solution to an LNCC equation?

  "body": " Selecting the Particular Solution Form   In the previous section, we saw that the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation has two parts: the homogeneous solution  and the particular solution  . The homogeneous solution is found using the characteristic equation, while the particular solution is constructed by (1) selecting a form similar to the forcing function, , and (2) determining the coefficients of that form.  In this section, we focus on selecting a form for . The key idea is to match the structural form of the forcing function , so that when it is substituted into the differential equation, all the resulting terms simplify to .    Selecting Basic Forms  The first step in choosing is recognizing the structure of . Since and its derivatives must eventually simplify to match , should have a similar form. If is a polynomial, exponential, sine, or cosine function, then should be too.   provides a guide for selecting an initial form of based on the type of . In each case, represent the undetermined coefficients we'll solve for later.    forms based on , where are known constants. must be determined. Degree 4+ polynomials follow a similar pattern.        Forcing Function Type,  Particular Solution Form,    1  (constant)     2      3      4      5      6       One important note: even if a term is missing in , you should still include it in if it's part of the general form. For example:   🔸  If , the term is missing, but must still include it: .    🔸  If , then . Even though isn't in , it's needed because its derivative produces cosine terms.    Selecting Basic Forms of   Use to determine the appropriate form of in each case.      Since is exponential, we use : .         This matches . Even though doesn't appear in , we include it: .          is a degree 2 polynomial, so from : .         Move the constant to the right side: . Now is constant ( ): .         4th degree polynomials are not represented in the table, but follow a similar pattern: .        📖❓ Matching single term forcing functions to the particular form   Drag each forcing function on the left to the initial selection of on the right.                                                When Guessing Works (and When It Doesn't)  This method of guessing the particular solution based on the forcing function is very effective. However, it does have its limitations. In particular, it only applies when can be written as a sum or product of:   Polynomials, like  Exponentials, like  Sine and cosine functions, like  Any sum or product of these function types   Functions such as , , or fall outside this category. For those, we'll need a different method entirely. But for the allowed types, this method offers a fast and reliable way to select .   📖❓ When to Guess   Which types of forcing functions are suitable for the Method of Undetermined Coefficients?      Polynomial functions like  Correct! Polynomial functions are suitable for this method.    Exponential functions like  Correct! Exponential functions are also suitable.    Sine or cosine functions like or  Correct! Sine and cosine functions are suitable as well.    Functions like or  Not quite. The method does not apply to logarithmic or tangent functions.       Combining Basic Forms via Addition  If is a sum of different function types, say a polynomial plus an exponential, then should be a sum of the corresponding matching forms.   Initial form of   Use to identify the appropriate form of in each case.      This matches is exponential plus constant, so: .         Both terms have the same argument, , the form is the standard  .         This combines exponential and sine, so we need: .         Cosines with different arguments requires the sum of two forms:         📖❓ Sum of particular solution forms   Select the initial form of the particular solution for an LNCC equation with forcing function: .      Incorrect. Derivatives of this form will not yield a term.     Incorrect. This form is missing a term.     Incorrect. This form is inappropriate since the forcing function is not a product of an exponential function and sine or cosine functions.     Correct! Although the forcing function does not contain a cosine term, the derivatives of cosine terms can still produce sine terms.       Combining Basic Forms via Multiplication  If the forcing function is a product of basic function types—such as a polynomial times an exponential—then the particular solution must also be a product of their matching forms. For example, the differential equation  , has a forcing function that is a quadratic times an exponential, so we start with: .  However, be careful: multiplying by just makes new coefficients:   Since each pair can be merged as single coefficient, we just relabel them:   We'll use this simplification trick often. It keeps the form of clean and will make solving for , and much easier later.   📖❓ Product of particular solution forms   Select the initial form of the particular solution for an LNCC equation with forcing function: .      Correct! The forcing function is the product of a 2nd degree polynomial and an exponential function, so the particular solution should be the product the most general 2nd degree polynomial and an exponential function.     Incorrect. Although this form perfectly matches the form of the forcing function, the solution could potentially include and free terms.     Incorrect. The term also needs a coefficient.

In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do and play, and why is it important that they are independent?      represents the solution to the homogeneous equation (where the nonhomogeneous term is zero), while represents a particular solution that accounts for the nonhomogeneous term. It is important that they are independent so that their combined terms accurately reflect the behavior of both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts of the original differential equation.      Describe the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation.    A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives. For example, the equation is non-homogeneous because of the term on the right side, which is not a derivative or multiple of .

  "title": "Derivative Transfer via Integration by Parts",
  "body": " Derivative Transfer via Integration by Parts   Before we apply the Laplace transform to solve differential equations, we need to understand its foundational mechanism: transferring derivatives within an integral. This section begins with a quick refresher on integration by parts (IBP), emphasizing how derivatives applied to one function can be shifted to another. This transfer process is the key that unlocks the Laplace transform method.    Differentiation and Integration Essentials   Let's quickly review two essential tools: how exponentials behave under differentiation, and the integration by parts formula we will use throughout this chapter.    📖❓ Exponential Derivatives   Match each exponential function with its derivative with respect to . Assume is constant.                           📖❓ Integration by Parts   Click on the correct integration by parts formula.                        Review of Integration by Parts (IBP)  Integration by parts is a core calculus technique that allows us to transfer derivatives from one function to another inside an integral. Its most common form is: .  When and are functions of , we get a version of IBP which makes the transfer of derivatives more clear:   This simple idea of shifting derivatives is the basis for the Laplace transform method. We'll see it in action when one of the functions is .   📖❓ Derivative Transfer Technique   Which concept from calculus allows you to transfer the derivative of one function to another inside an integral?     Chain Rule   Incorrect. The chain rule is used for function compositions, not transferring derivatives within an integral.     L'Hôpital's Rule   Incorrect. L'Hôpital's Rule helps evaluate indeterminate limits, not manipulate derivatives inside integrals.     Integration by Parts   Correct! Integration by parts is the key tool that shifts derivatives between functions inside integrals.     Implicit Differentiation   Incorrect. Implicit differentiation helps with equations where the dependent variable isn't isolated.        Using Exponentials to Transfer Derivatives   👀 Review: Derivative of   Let be a constant. Which function is equal to the derivative ?       Correct! The derivative of with respect to is by the chain rule.       Incorrect. You're missing the from the chain rule.       Incorrect. The sign should be negative because the exponent is .       Incorrect. This form appears when integrating, not differentiating. Try applying the chain rule.      Let's now see why exponentials make this derivative transfer especially useful. Suppose we choose and . Differentiating gives and . Applying integration by parts yields:   Notice the key point: the derivative on has been completely removed. Instead, we get two terms: a boundary term and a new integral without .  This trade is usually worth it since in the context of Laplace transforms, the term will often vanish and is the given initial condition.    🤔💭 Derivative Transfer Reading Questions   📖❓ Key Concepts Behind Laplace Transforms   Which two core mathematical ideas does the Laplace transform method rely on to solve differential equations?     Chain Rule   Incorrect. The chain rule is not central to the Laplace transform method. Think about a process that lets you transfer derivatives.     Product Rule   No, the product rule is not a key idea in the Laplace transform method. Consider an integration-based technique.     Integration by Parts   Correct! Integration by parts allows derivatives to be transferred between functions inside an integral, a foundational technique in the Laplace method.     Properties of Exponential Functions   Correct! The method uses properties of exponential functions, especially their predictable behavior under differentiation and integration.       📖❓ IBP on   Select the result of applying integration by parts to .   Don't think of this as a Calculus exercise. Instead, try to think about transferring derivatives.        Incorrect. A correct application of integration by parts must include the right choice of and . Try again.       Incorrect. Be sure you're transferring the derivative and integrating the right part.

  "title": "Defining the Laplace Transform",
  "body": " Defining the Laplace Transform   We've seen how integration by parts transfers derivatives from one function to another inside an integral. Now we take the next step: defining a transform that systematically applies this principle.  In this section, we'll see how this transform is constructed and how it converts functions of into functions of . You'll also see how to compute Laplace transforms from the definition.    Why Use the Laplace Transform?  To see where we're headed, imagine you need to solve the differential equation   Suppose you multiply both sides by and integrate with respect to :   The left-hand side contains a derivative inside the integral. From the previous section, you know we can transfer this derivative to the exponential function. Doing so removes the derivative from , essentially allowing you to use algebra to isolate it.  This is the idea behind the Laplace transform and the motivation for its definition.    Definition of the Laplace Transform  Laplace Transform   Given a function defined for , its Laplace transform, denoted , is defined by provided the integral converges. The result is a new function, typically written as a capitalized version of the variable you are transforming. In this case:      📖❓ Spot the Error in the Definition   Click on the incorrect part of the Laplace transform definition.                       Working with Improper Integrals  Notice that the Laplace transform involves an improper integral: the upper limit is . In calculus, we handle this by replacing with a variable , computing the definite integral, and then taking the limit as : .  When calculating Laplace transforms, you first compute the integral with respect to , treating as a constant. Then you compute the limit of the result as approaches .  The Laplace transform exists if this limit produces a finite value. Often, exponential decay from guarantees convergence when is large enough.   📖❓ Convergence Requirement for Laplace Transforms   To compute an improper integral, you write it as a limit of a definite integral. For example, .  Select variables\/constants would you expect to see after computing the integral, , but before taking the limit.       The variable is a constant in so it will also appear in the antiderivative.     The variable gets plugged into after you find the antiderivative.     Since the variable of integration is , you plug the limits of integration, and , into once you have the antiderivative.    (integration constant)  We are computing a definite integral, not an indefinite one.        👀 Quick Review: Exponential Properties  To get through the transform rule derivations, you'll need to be familiar with some key exponential properties that will appear throughtout this chapter.   Exponential Antiderivative  For any constant , we have: . While this can be found by substituting , it is such a common antiderivative that you should just know it without this extra step.    Exponential End Behavior  The end behavior can be seen from the most basic exponential function:             In general, the end behavior depends on whether the power goes to or :      In this section, we will take limits as . Your goal will be to figure out if causes the power to go to or . Only then will you know where goes.   📖❓ Checkpoint: Exponential Properties   Exponential Antiderivative   Evaluate:            Exponential End Behavior   Determine if each limit is -ထ, , or ထ.

We'll start with a constant function and a linear function.   First Look at Laplace Transforms  Find the Laplace transform of    (constant function)     By the definition above, we have the improper integral .

This means that is also a number that can be pulled out of the limit using the limit property from calculus:     We find the limit using the end behavior of the exponential . There are two possiblities:  is excluded since it would lead to    is positive:    is negative:     Since we only get convergence when is positive, we must require in the Laplace transform of : .

Therefore, the Laplace transform of is .       These examples show the typical process: set up the improper integral, compute it as a definite integral, then take the limit as . You'll see how emerges naturally from this process.  In upcoming sections, we'll build a library of Laplace transforms for the most common functions and learn properties that make these computations even faster.   "

  "body": " Transform Properties and Rules   So far, we've built a small library of Laplace transforms for basic functions. But how do we handle functions that are combinations of these basic functions? This is where the properties of Laplace transform comes in.  In this section, we'll learn how the Laplace transform interacts with sums, products, exponentials, derivatives, and powers of . Each property gives us a shortcut: a way to break down complex functions into simpler parts using the transforms we already know.  These properties will be your main tools for solving differential equations quickly and efficiently.    👀❓ Integral Properties   Select all the true statements related to properties of indefinite integrals.      This is the linearity property of integrals.     Since we are integrating with respect to , we can treat as a constant.     In calculus, you had to integrate this using integration by parts.     Be careful, .      Linearity: Sums and Constant Multiples  Like integrals, the Laplace transform is linear. This means we can take apart sums and pull out constant multiples. In particular, if the Laplace transforms of and exist, then we have the following linearity property:   This property allows us to break complex expressions into smaller pieces, each of which can be transformed using our basic table.   Transforming a Sum of Functions   Compute the Laplace transform .    We apply the linearity property to break the transform down as follows:   Then, using the common transforms, L , L ( ) , and L ( ) , we get   We use , because it guarantees that is also true.      📖❓ Invalid Uses of Linearity   Which of the following are NOT correct applications of the linearity property?       Linearity does not apply to a product of functions.     The linearity property does not extend to powers of functions.     This is a correct use of the linearity property.     This is correct since .      📖❓ Transform of            Correct! Use linearity: transform each term individually and add them together.       No, the transform of includes in the numerator, and the constant should be added.       No, the frequency of is 1, not 7, and the free term transforms to .       No, the free term should yield , and it should be added.         Derivatives of Functions (Derivative Transfer)  One of the most powerful features of the Laplace transform is its ability to transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This means we need a way to remove the derivatives from the unknown in our differential equation. The following property perfectly encapsulates this idea:   In short, this property uses integration by parts to transfer the derivative from to . This results in a factor of (chain rule on ) and as follows:  .  Click here for more details   To show that , we start with the definition of the Laplace transform:   .  Applying integration by parts to once in with integration by parts gives   Recall that a requirement for the Laplace transform of to exist is that .

An integer variable may be initialized to a value.     .*  Try to figure out the function in this case.      Notice that this property is also recursive, meaning it shows us how to handle higher-order derivatives as well.

No, the subtraction term is , not .       No, the sign should be negative already in the formula; the constant subtracted is .         Multiplication by (Exponential Shifting)  It turns out that as long as we know the Laplace transform of , , then we also know the Laplace transform of since  . So multiplying a function by shifts its Laplace transform horizontally by .   Laplace Transform of an Exponential Function  Use the exponential shifting property to compute the following           To apply the shifting property , we identify and as follows:   By definition, , so .  Finally, substituting for in the formula for , we have .               In this case, and . For , we have .  By definition, , so .  Substituting for in , we have , where .               In this case, and . So .  By definition, , so .  Substituting for in gives .       By applying a similar strategy to the functions , , and , we can add the following three Laplace transforms to our list of common transforms:     📖❓ Shifting a Transform of Sine            Correct!

Before we begin, we note that it's very tempting to think that because we know the Laplace transforms of both and we can simply multiply those together to get the desired Laplace transform. However, this is not the case, just as similar statements were not true for finding the derivatives and integrals of the products of functions. Rather, we will need to use property , with and    We need to know what is before we can proceed. Let's go back to the naming system we have instituted. If we have a capital that is the Laplace transform of a function lower case We identified that function previously: We use to find its Laplace transform. Then we continue finding by taking two derivatives (using the quotient rule for derivatives; details are omitted here).                Use the first shifting theorem: .

  "body": " Step 1 — Into the Laplace Domain   The first step of the Laplace transform method is to convert a differential equation—where the unknown appears through derivatives—into an algebraic equation in the Laplace domain. This transformation makes it easier to isolate the unknown and move toward a solution.    Crossing Into the Laplace Domain  In terms of the roadmap, we can visualize this first step as follows:  Step 1️⃣: Into the Laplace Domain (Forward Transform)                             Simply put, forward transforming a differential equation into the Laplace domain means applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation. The result is an algebraic equation where the derivatives have been converted into powers of and the new unknown is .    Basic Mechanics of the Forward Transform  Symbolically, applying the forward Laplace transform to the differential equation amounts to applying it to both sides of the equation as follows: .  Using the linearity property we can see that the transform applies to each term:  . Letting and applying rule R for and common transform L , we get:  . This is where the initial conditions come into play. Substituting the initial conditions and simplifying gives the desired Laplace domain equation:  . Our new unknown is and since the derivatives have been eliminated, we can use algebra to solve for it. In fact, the solution to our differential equation is actually hiding inside . So, by solving for you are also solving for at the same time!  Let's practice this with a one more example.   Forward Transforming Equations   Forward transform the following equations into the Laplace domain:     First applying the Laplace transform to both sides:  . Now, use the linearity property :  . Let , and apply rule R & R and common transform L   . Finally, plug in the initial conditions, and clean up:  .    📖❓ Select the Forward Transform   Which of the following represents the correct Laplace transform of the equation ?      This is the correct transformation using the Laplace transform and applying initial conditions.     This answer is missing a term.     Double check the signs of the initial conditions.     This answer is missing a term.     Now that you've seen the mechanical steps involved with applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation, it is important to take a moment to see what's happening behind the scenes during this process.    What is Going on Behind the Scenes?   📖❓ Applying the Laplace Transform to an Equation    Fill-in-the-blanks:   The process of applying a Laplace transform to a differential equation involves multiplying the equation by and with respect to .      integrating   No, this misses the parameter in the exponential.

Since the Laplace transform only applies to functions, applying a forward transform to a differential equation , really means we are taking the Laplace transform to both sides of that equation. So, applying a forward transformation to the initial-value problem implies that we multiply both sides of the equation by and integrate from to :              Next, we use the linearity of the integral:      After applying integration by parts to , the derivative is transferred from to , resulting in a factor of and an evaluation of at and :              The details for computing are given here .

Solving this equation is usually easier than solving the original differential equation, but we still need to work carefully. In this section, you'll learn how to isolate , clean it up using algebra, and get it into a form that matches the inverse transform table.    What It Means to Solve in the Laplace Domain  After transforming a differential equation into the Laplace domain, you're left with an algebraic equation involving . We will call this the Laplace-domain equation. In this setting, your new unknown is now represented by its Laplace transform, .  Your goal is twofold: first, solve for using algebra, and second, rewrite so it matches known inverse transform forms. That prepares it for the final step of returning to the original domain.  Step 2️⃣: Solve for & Prepare it for an Inverse Transform                  📖❓ What are we solving for?

This means using standard algebra to isolate on one side of the equation. Here is a quick example.   Solving a Laplace-Domain Equation   Solve the Laplace-domain equation for :     Start by moving all non- terms to the right-hand side:   Now, factor from the remaining terms on the left-hand side:   Finally, divide both sides by the quadratic expression to isolate :       Preparing for the Inverse Transform   Once you've solved for , the next step is to prepare it for returning to the original domain. This means rewriting as a combination of expressions that match known Laplace transforms, so we can use the inverse transform to find .  The inverse Laplace transform works by reversing the process of the forward transform. This can be done using the same table of transforms —but in reverse. Our goal is to express as a sum of terms that match entries in the -domain column.    Preparation Guidelines  After isolating from the transformed equation, you typically are left with a messy combination of rational functions in the variable .  Since we can only invert functions in the -domain column of the table of common Laplace transforms , it helps to list them out to guide us on how to prepare .                      To invert , it must first be written as the sum of one or more of these terms. However, since the first row is a special case of the second when , we can reduce the list down to the following function types:   Fortunately, there is a technique that was designed for this exact task. Recall that partial fraction decomposition (PFD) guarantees that any rational function can be written as the sum of rational terms with linear or quadratic factors in the denominator.  Therefore, if the denominator of has degree three or higher, PFD will always be your first step toward preparing for a backward transform out of the Laplace domain.    Dealing with Quadratic Denominators  After partial fraction decomposition, will be the sum of rational terms with either a linear or quadratic factor in the denominator. If they are all linear then you are done and you can move on to inverting . In contrast, if at least one term has a quadratic denominator then it will be of the form . where we have omitted the numerator since will be not be important to this discussion.  Notice that the denominator is not nicely factored like you see in the transform table. To achieve this, we need to complete the square .  Note that if the quadratic denominator term was the result of partial fraction decomposition, then it cannot be reduced further and you should skip directly to completing the square of the denominator. However, if started with this form, then you should first check to see if the denominator is factorable. If so, then use PFD. Otherwise, complete the square of the denominator so that it resembles the form in the table:    📖❓ Complete the Square   Give the correct form after completing the square of the denominator:       Correct     Incorrect     Incorrect     Incorrect        Preparation Examples  In the following examples, we prepare for an inverse Laplace transform by writing it as the sum of the following types of terms: .

  "title": "Step 3 — Leaving the Laplace Domain",
  "body": " Step 3 — Leaving the Laplace Domain   Up to this point, we've been working inside the Laplace domain — a mathematical space where differential equations are replaced by algebraic ones. We used forward Laplace transforms to move from to , solved for , and simplified it to match known inverse forms.  Now, it's time to take the final step: returning to the original domain where the solution is a function of time. To do this, we apply the inverse Laplace transform , denoted , which undoes the effect of the forward transform.    What Is the Inverse Laplace Transform?  Symbolically, the inverse Laplace transform works much like the inverse of a standard function. For example, we can release from inside the cosine by applying the inverse cosine:   Similarly, we can release from inside a Laplace transform by applying its inverse:   This is the idea behind the final step of the Laplace transform method as it takes us back into the original domain by releasing the contained inside . Visually, this looks like:  Step 3️⃣: Out of the Laplace Domain (Backward Transform)                              📖❓ What does the inverse transform do?   What is the purpose of the inverse Laplace transform in solving a differential equation?     It recovers the original function from its Laplace-transformed version .  Correct! The inverse transform brings us back to the time domain.    It rewrites a differential equation using algebra.  That's what the forward transform does.    It simplifies partial fractions.  Partial fraction decomposition helps prepare for the inverse, but isn't the transform itself.    It evaluates the Laplace transform of .  This describes the forward transform, not the inverse.       Using the Table to Invert  During the forward step, we used the table to map functions of in the -domain column, like or , into functions of in the -domain column. Now, we'll do the opposite: match terms in to the forms in the -domain column and map them back to functions in the -domain column.  For example, suppose we have the following in the Laplace domain:   To return back this to the original domain we apply the inverse to both sides:   We have , but it needs to be a function of . For that, we match to one of the forms in the -domain column of the table .  We see the best match is L with , so we get:   Inverses using the Laplace Transform Table   Apply the inverse transform to reveal the solution, , in the original domain.         This matches L with . So, .           This matches L with and . So, .           Noting that and using L with , we get .          📖❓ Use the Transform Table   For each , use the table of transforms to determine .                                           📖❓ Table Matching Checkpoint  Which of the following is the correct inverse Laplace transform of ?     Correct! This matches L 6 with , .     This is missing the exponential factor .     This flips and . Be careful when matching the form.     This would require in the numerator and instead of .      So far, we've only dealt with expressions that match a single row in the transform table. But most Laplace domain solutions are a sum of multiple terms. Fortunately, we don't need to invert the entire thing at once. We'll use linearity to handle those in the next section.    Linearity of the Inverse Laplace Transform  Most Laplace-domain solutions are not single terms. Instead, they're sums of several expressions. Fortunately, like the forward transform, the inverse Laplace transform is also linear. This means that inverse transforms of sums and constant multiples of functions can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps.  Assuming and are functions in the Laplace domain, then we have:   Here's an example of this linearity property in action.   Inverse Transform of a Sum   Find if .    We break this into two parts and use the transform table to invert each one.   The first term matches L and gives . The second term matches L with , giving . So the solution is:      📖❓ Apply Linearity  Suppose . What is ?     Perfect! The first term matches and the second is a sine with .     Double check the sign in . It corresponds to , not .     The second term matches a sine form, not cosine.     corresponds to , not a polynomial term.     Linearity makes inverting multi-term expressions much more manageable. Sometimes you'll run into expressions that don't quite match anything in the table. They're close—but not perfect. In the next section, we'll look at how to make small algebraic adjustments that bring those expressions into a form we can invert.    Minor Adjustments for a Perfect Match   Sometimes, the Laplace-domain function is close to a known table form—but not quite there. In these cases, a few algebraic adjustments will help reveal the match. These are not major rewrites, just small nudges: splitting a numerator, factoring out constants, or rewriting terms to expose a recognizable pattern.    Separate Fractions to Match Multiple Forms  Suppose your function has a sum in the numerator, like . The denominator matches both sine and cosine forms in the table, but the numerator doesn't match any of the entries. The fix? Separate the addition in the numerator:  . Then factor constants and attempt to match with the table again:  . The first term perfectly matches, the second term needs in the numerator. Missing numbers in the numerator is common with inverse transforms, but there is an easy fix. We multiply numerator and denominator by the missing number:  🚩 Multiplying by   is just a special form of ; multiplying by it doesn't change the fraction.   . With these minor adjustments, the inverse transform becomes straightforward: .   📖❓ Splitting to Match Table Forms   Which of the following functions can be split into separate terms that match known inverse Laplace transforms?       Incorrect. This function already matches a known sine form and doesn't require splitting.       Correct! This function can be split as , matching cosine and sine forms.       Incorrect. This function already matches and does not require splitting.        Adding and Subtracting to Match Shifts  Some forms contain a shift, like . For example, the form looks similar to L , but the numerator should be . This can be fixed by subtracting and adding , like so:  🚩 Adding   is just a special form of ; adding it to the numerator doesn't change the fraction.    Now you can separate the fraction as before:   These can be a little tricky so here's a few additional examples to prepare you for what you may encounter.  Handling Coefficients on   Find if     The first term needs in the numerator, but before adding and subtracting , let's get out of the way by factoring it out:  . Now, splitting the fraction inside the parentheses and distributing the gives us  . Finally, the backward transform is given by  .    📖❓ Give the Numerator of the Split Fractions   After adjusting the numerator to match L and separating the fractions, type-in the numerators of the separated fractions?                          The answers you enter should be fully simplified.      s\\s*-\\s*1|-1\\s*\\+\\s*s  .*  Incorrect     2|-\\s*1\\s*\\+\\s*3  .*  Incorrect      Complete the Square First   Find if     Completing the square for the denominator of gives: .  The form of the denominator and the in the numerator indicates that we are trying to match L ( , ), but we need in the numerator. So we add and subtract , then split the fraction:  . Since the second term needs a in the numerator, we multiply it by :  . From here, the inverse transform comes from the table:  .    📖❓ Give the Next Step   What is the next step toward finding the inverse of ?      Factor the denominator   Incorrect. The quadratic cannot be factored; try something else.     Complete the square in the denominator   Correct! Completing the square helps you match the form needed to invert with L .     Cancel out the in the numerator and denominator.   Canceling parts of rational expressions like this isn't valid.     Differentiate the entire function   Nope—this isn't a derivative problem.       With practice, these adjustments become intuitive, greatly simplifying the process of leaving the Laplace domain to recover the solution to the original differential equation.

Completing the square is a technique used to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms, particularly those involving sine and cosine functions.      Why is partial fraction decomposition helpful in finding inverse Laplace transforms?     Partial fraction decomposition breaks down complex rational functions into simpler fractions that correspond to known inverse Laplace transforms, making the transformation process easier.    Why is the Laplace Transform Method considered a powerful tool for solving differential equations?     What role does the table of common Laplace transforms play in the Laplace Transform Method?      Explain how the Laplace transform simplifies solving linear differential equations. Include a discussion of how initial conditions are incorporated into the transformed equation.    The Laplace transform converts a linear differential equation into an algebraic equation in the -domain. This simplification occurs because the transform converts derivatives into polynomials of , reducing the differential equation to a solvable algebraic equation. Initial conditions are directly incorporated into the transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include constants that reflect the initial values of the function and its derivatives.

As in the previous examples, the denominator is a second-degree polynomial; therefore it is sensible for us to begin by completing the square in the denominator as we did in the previous two examples.   Take a careful look at the denominator here. It's really close to matching or , but it is not a match because of the negative sign in front of the We need to change course when this happens. Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a partial fraction decomposition.   Margin note: If you need to review partial fraction decomposition, go HERE.    We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like-terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.          Since has a quadratic function in the denominator, it makes sense that we would try to match it with one of the forms above, however, the form of the numerator suggests matching it with the second expression.  As we mentioned earlier, we'll try to make the denominator match first. Since both of the forms we're trying to match are of the form we will complete the square first: (If you still don't remember how to complete the square, look up that primer and do the previous exercises in that section above.)  Let's rewrite the given expression as follows.   We've got the denominator in exactly the right form, it looks just like with and . As in the previous section, once we've gotten the denominator in shape, we turn our attention to the numerator. If we look back at the two forms we are trying to match, we see that our expression has an in the numerator, so it's more like . It would be exactly right if we had in the numerator, which in this case would be .  What we do have in the numerator is ; and we would like it to be which means if we added 4, we'd have exactly the right thing. If we want to add 4, we'll need to compensate by also subtracting 4, like this:   Great! Now we can split this single fraction into two separate fractions: We're almost there! The first fraction is a perfect match for the form (with and ); but we still have another expression that is not yet a match. The remaining fraction looks like it could eventually match the form . We would need to have a 5 in the numerator, and we currently have a 4. But we can fix that as we did in the previous section: Now let's put it all together. Here's everything we did:   As mentioned before, being able to use appropriate algebra to \"match\" forms is really important when we work with Laplace Transforms. Since it's really just algebra, now is a great time to practice that skill, so when we are in the middle of studying Laplace Transforms, you can just focus on the \"new\" stuff.                                               Backward Transforms- Level 3                   First, factor the denominator as . Then, decompose the expression into . Solving for and , you get the inverse Laplace transform as .                                   Note that as the quadratic term in the denominator does not factor, the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor and a repeated linear factor.

Take a careful look at the denominator here. It's really close to matching or , but it is not a match because of the negative sign in front of the We need to change course when this happens. Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a partial fraction decomposition.   Margin note: If you need to review partial fraction decomposition, go HERE.    We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like-terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.    "

As we mentioned earlier, we'll try to make the denominator match first. Since both of the forms we're trying to match are of the form we will complete the square first: (If you still don't remember how to complete the square, look up that primer and do the previous exercises in that section above.)  Let's rewrite the given expression as follows.   We've got the denominator in exactly the right form, it looks just like with and . As in the previous section, once we've gotten the denominator in shape, we turn our attention to the numerator. If we look back at the two forms we are trying to match, we see that our expression has an in the numerator, so it's more like . It would be exactly right if we had in the numerator, which in this case would be .  What we do have in the numerator is ; and we would like it to be which means if we added 4, we'd have exactly the right thing. If we want to add 4, we'll need to compensate by also subtracting 4, like this:   Great! Now we can split this single fraction into two separate fractions: We're almost there! The first fraction is a perfect match for the form (with and ); but we still have another expression that is not yet a match. The remaining fraction looks like it could eventually match the form . We would need to have a 5 in the numerator, and we currently have a 4. But we can fix that as we did in the previous section: Now let's put it all together. Here's everything we did:   As mentioned before, being able to use appropriate algebra to \"match\" forms is really important when we work with Laplace Transforms. Since it's really just algebra, now is a great time to practice that skill, so when we are in the middle of studying Laplace Transforms, you can just focus on the \"new\" stuff.   "

  "title": "Piecewise Functions",
  "body": " Piecewise Functions   Piecewise functions can feel disorganized at first since they are defined in separate chunks across different intervals. But there's a powerful way to express them as a clean formula: by using step functions to switch each piece ON or OFF at the right time.    What Makes a Function Piecewise?  A piecewise function is any function built from different parts over specific regions of its domain. For example:            Each piece has its own behavior, but together they create the entire function. The question is: can we rewrite these separate pieces so that the whole function is described with one equation, instead of a case-by-case breakdown?    Thinking in Terms of Switches   📖❓ Match Step Functions to Their Piecewise Definitions   By dragging from left to right, match the function on the left to the equivalent piecewise function on the right. Note that, .                       Every step function you've seen can be thought of as a simple ON–OFF switch:   With these step functions, you can literally program when each part of a function is ON and when it is OFF.  For example, the three pieces of above can be controlled like this:    Three pieces of                       Rewriting a Piecewise Function in Step Form   📖❓ Matching Step Types to Intervals   Match each time interval to the type of unit step expression that would activate a function over that range.    These pairings are essential when converting a piecewise function into unit step form. The form you choose depends entirely on where each piece is active.                       shows three non-overlapping regions. That means for any value of , only one piece of the function is active. Because of this, we can write as a single sum:  . Let's test this step-function version by plugging in a few values and seeing which terms turn ON and which turn OFF.   Like the piecewise form, plugging a specific value into was the same as plugging it into just one of its three pieces. This observation highlights why the unit step form is equivalent to the piecewise form.   📜 Converting Piecewise Form to Unit Step Form  Here's a strategy for converting any piecewise function into step form:  Find the intervals where each piece is active.  Match the active interval for each piece to its step function switch:     Piece  Active Interval  Step Function Switch                    Multiply the piece by its switch, then add them all together.      📖❓ Which Term Matches the Interval?   You're converting a piecewise function into step form. Which term below correctly captures a piece of the function that is active only for ?       This turns ON before and OFF after. We want something that activates at and deactivates at .       This starts at and keeps going. It doesn't define an interval, it defines a forever switch.       Exactly. This is the window function that's ON from to and OFF otherwise.       Close, but this would result in on , not . Try reversing the order of the terms.      Now you're ready to try a few full conversions yourself.   Using to Turn ON Sine    Rewrite the function using a unit step function.     Since turns ON at , we multiply it by :   Plugging in , confirms we arrived at the correct piecewise function: and has the following graph    Graph of            Converting to Unit Step Form   Rewrite the following piecewise functions using unit step notation:            The first piece is active before , so we use .

  "title": "Laplace Transform Rules for Step Functions",
  "body": " Laplace Transform Rules for Step Functions   Up to this point, you've seen how unit step functions can switch pieces of a function ON and OFF at the right times. But to actually use these functions in solving differential equations, we need to understand how they behave when we take their Laplace transform.  This section develops the Laplace transform rules for unit step functions:   – how to transform a single step switch.  – how to transform a function that is switched ON at .  – how to transform a shifted function that starts at .   These rules are the backbone for handling piecewise functions with Laplace methods.    Transform of   📖❓ How Do Inputs Shift?   The function is the same as shifted left by 2 units.    Replacing with shifts the graph to the left by units. This is the opposite direction compared to .    We begin with the Laplace transform of a single shifted unit step switch, . Finding its transform lays the groundwork for the more general rules that follow.  The Laplace transform of a shifted unit step function is as follows:   📜 Laplace Transform of     💡 Derivation of  Start with the definition of the Laplace transform:   Recall that: which means the integrand is zero until and equals afterward.  That trims our integral down since:   Evaluate the improper integral as a limit:   As long as , the term goes to zero as , leaving:      This result shows that the shifted unit step function introduces an exponential factor in the Laplace domain. You will use it to transform terms of the form , where is a constant. For example,    📖❓ Finding the Laplace Transform of   What is the Laplace transform of ?       Close, but is a variable in the Laplace domain, it doesn't get replaced by a number here.       That's the formula: , and here .       That's the transform of , not a step function. The exponential in appears in the numerator, not the exponent of the input.       That's an incorrect inversion of the formula. The exponential should be in the numerator, and in the denominator.        Transform of  The next rule provides a formula for the product of a step function and a function of and will be the primary tool used when forward transforming a piecewise function.   📜 Laplace Transform of    💡 Derivation of  Start with the Laplace transform definition:   Since for , the integral simplifies to:   This new integral looks a lot like the Laplace transform of , but it starts at instead of . Luckily, we can shift the graph of to the left units to force the integral start back at .  Note: Shifting a function units to the left means adding to all of the inputs:   Using this idea, leads to the desired transform:   Details   : Shifting to the left units makes it and starts the integral at .   : Exponential Property    : Factor out the constant, , as we are integrating in .   Therefore,      Let's try this on a few examples to see how the rule works in practice.   Transform of   Compute the Laplace transform of .    For this problem, we have . So the rule becomes: , where, in our case, , so .  Plugging and into the rule shows us that   So all we have left to do is compute : and plug it into (⭐), to complete the transform:     Check Your Understanding   📖❓ Apply the Rule for   What is the Laplace transform of ?       Close, but we must shift the input inside the function, not leave it as .       Correct. The shift rule says to replace with inside the function and multiply by .       Be careful, shifts the function right, but the rule calls for when we delay the function using .       This uses the right format, but doesn't evaluate the Laplace transform. We're looking for a formula that includes the exponential shift.       📖❓ Next Step for the Rule   Suppose you want use L to find . You note that and update the rule as follows: . What's the best next step from here?     Identify , find .  Correct — you need to compute .    Find .  Finding isn't needed for this rule.    Find .  This does not help you compute .    Rewrite the rule by moving to the denominator as .  You could do this, but there is a better answer.        Transform of  Finally, we cover the last rule that will be particularly useful for inverting expressions in the Laplace domain (i.e., step 3 ) that are associated with step functions.   📜 Laplace Transform of     Derivation of  In terms of the definition of the Laplace transform, we want to show:   To show this, we will start with the integral on the left and show it leads to the integral on the right.   Details   : on makes the lower limit of the integral .   : Shifting to the left units makes it and starts the integral at .   : Use the exponential property and factor out the constant, , as we are integrating in .   Thus, we have shown where .     Although you can use this for forward transforms, its main utility is for backward transforms since it only requires you to match terms that look like where is one of the common Laplace transforms from the same table. We will explore later when we invert terms in the Laplace domain containing .   📖❓ Identify the Shifted Input   Select the expression that goes in the blank.       Good! The rule requires replacing with when multiplying by .     Not quite — you need to shift the input to because the step turns ON at .     Incorrect, try again.     Incorrect, try again.

  "body": " Transforming Piecewise Functions   Until now, you've learned how step functions act like ON–OFF switches, and you've built the three key Laplace rules (L , L , and L ) that describe how those switches behave under the Laplace transform. With these tools, we're ready for the real payoff: transforming entire piecewise functions .    General Strategy  The game plan for handling a piecewise function in the Laplace domain is always the same three steps.   📜 Laplace Transform of a Piecewise Function  To find for a piecewise function:  Rewrite using unit step functions.  Combine and simplify terms so you have the fewest possible -switches.  Apply the Laplace rules ( L , L , L ) one piece at a time.     That's it. Once each term is transformed, you can add them up thanks to linearity. You'll be left with a fully transformed piecewise function living in the Laplace domain.  📖❓ Strategy for Transforming a Piecewise Function  What's Should you do First?   To take the Laplace transform of a piecewise function, you should first rewrite it in terms of unit step functions.    That's the foundation of this method! Once a piecewise function is rewritten using step functions, you can apply the shift rule to each piece.    Matching Activation Intervals to Switches   On the left are activation intervals for a piecewise function. Drag each interval to the unit step switch that activates it.

The pieces, intervals and switches for are:      Piece  Active Interval  Step Function Switch                   Multiply each piece by its switch, then sum:  . Combine like switch terms:  .

  "body": " Laplace Method with Piecewise Forcing Terms   This is the moment where everything you've learned about Laplace transforms, step functions, and piecewise rewriting comes together. We'll now use the Laplace method to solve differential equations whose forcing terms switch ON and OFF across time.  The big picture is the same familiar three-step Laplace method you already know:  Step 1: Forward transform the differential equation into the Laplace domain.  Step 2: Solve for algebraically and prepare it for inversion.  Step 3: Apply the inverse Laplace transform to recover .  The only twist is that our forcing term is now piecewise, so the process begins with a setup step of rewriting the forcing term using step functions.    A Model Problem  Let's solve this initial value problem to see the full method in action: where the forcing term switches ON for just one second:   You'll recognize the roadmap: forward transform → solve in the Laplace domain → inverse transform. But watch how the step function representation drives every stage of the solution.  🗺️ A Roadmap Overview                          Setup: Piecewise Form to Step Form  The piecewise function, , must be expressed in step function form before we can take its transform. Since has only one non-zero piece on the activation interval, , the only switch we need is :     Step 1 — Into the Laplace Domain  We are now ready to apply to both sides, term-by-term, using linearity:   Using rules R with and L , gives the Laplace-domain equation:  .   Step 2 — Solving in the Laplace Domain  Factor out from the left side and divide to isolate it:   This is the Laplace-domain solution. Next, we rewrite into a form that matches the inverse Laplace table.  In general, any exponential terms in (i.e., and ) will return to the original domain as unit step functions using L . Therefore, you should prioritize collecting exponentials whenever you see them. For our equation, this looks like:   📖❓ Matching Exponential Factors   What do exponential terms in the Laplace domain, like , correspond to in the original-domain solution, ?     A term with the step function switch, .  Correct — always brings in and a shift by .    A term with a coefficient of .  No — the exponential doesn't change coefficients like that.    An exponential term .  No — doesn't translate to .    A term containing .  No — perhaps you thought this looked like the forward transform ?      To match the form in L , its a good habit to define the shorthand: so that our prepared becomes: .  Since we'll also need in step 3, let's compute it now:   🔎 Here are the Details  Decompose: .  Multiply by and collect the , , and free terms: .  Matching coefficients gives the system: which has solution . Thus: and so the inverse is: .     Step 3 — Leaving the Laplace Domain  We now apply to both sides of the prepared  :   Applying L , our solution becomes: .  We use (from step 2) to plug in and , leading to the solution:    This problem demonstrates how the same Laplace method process can be applied to equations with piecewise forcing terms. With practice, you'll see that problems with piecewise forcing terms are no different from any other Laplace method problem.    Additional Examples  To cement the idea, here are a few more examples.

  "body": " Chapter 11 Exercises   ᯓ★❓ Quick-Answer Questions   True-False  Key Strategy Summary   When applying the Laplace transform to a piecewise function, the key strategy is to rewrite each piece using unit step functions and then apply the shift rule.    This strategy allows you to use a single formula for the entire function and apply Laplace transforms systematically.     Multiple-Choice  Choosing the Right Switch   Suppose a function is ON for . Which expression correctly switches it ON at that point?       This turns OFF at , which is the opposite of what we want.       That's right, flips ON at and stays ON from there.       Close! This is also correct, but we prefer to write it as for clarity in this context.       This turns ON from to , then OFF. Not what we want here.      Unit Step Behavior   What is the only possible set of values that any unit step function can take?     {1 only}  Unit step functions are OFF before , so they can also be 0.    {0, 1}  Correct! Unit step functions are always either 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON).    {any real number}  No, unit step functions are discrete switches, not continuous functions.    {any nonnegative number}  Even though the values are nonnegative, only 0 and 1 are ever used.     Rewriting an ON Interval   Which expression represents a function that is ON from to and OFF otherwise?      This expression turns ON at and back OFF at .     This stays ON after , but never switches OFF at .     This is ON before , but never turns ON at .     That would actually be negative during the interval from to , not what we want.     Multiplying by a Step Function   What is the effect of multiplying a function by ?     It shifts 6 units to the left.  Shifting the input would require , not multiplication by .    It keeps OFF before and turns it ON at .  Correct. acts as a switch that activates at .    It subtracts 6 from the output of .  Step functions don't affect the output directly, they control when the function is active.    It delays by 6 units.  Delaying would require rewriting the input as , not just multiplying by .     Equivalent to Piecewise Form   Which step-function expression is equivalent to the piecewise function       This turns 3 ON at and OFF again at .     This turns ON at , not .     This would be ON before , but it wouldn't stop at , it's ON too early.     This is ON at , but it stays ON forever, it doesn't turn OFF at .     Reading a Step Expression   Which interval does activate over?      is ON before and OFF afterward.     That would be true of , not its reversal.    only  This is a step function, not a spike, it applies to intervals, not points.     Again, that's when turns ON, not when its complement is active.     Laplace of a Shifted Step   What is ?      This is the standard formula for the Laplace transform of .     This is the transform of , not a step function.     This isn't a correct transformation of a step function, it doesn't match the form.     This inverts the formula incorrectly, look carefully at the units and exponents.     Using the Shift Rule   Suppose . What is ?      This is the shift rule in action: delay the function, then shift its input left.     The exponent should be negative, delaying adds .     This shifts the function right but doesn't match the form used in the shift rule.     The Laplace transform applies to the whole product, you can't apply it to one piece separately.     Shifting Inside the Transform   Which of the following is equal to ?      This follows directly from the shift rule, replace with .     We must shift the input, becomes .     You can't break apart the transform like this, it applies to the whole product.     That's the shifted polynomial, but we want the Laplace transform of that expression, not the polynomial itself.     Interpreting a Full Step Form   The function is written as: What can you infer about the original piecewise function?      It had three intervals: , , and .   Each change in step function corresponds to a new piece of the function.    It is active only for .  No, activates the function at .    It is always equal to .

Since equals 1 on and 0 elsewhere, we express it as: This transforms the differential equation into:    Step 1: Apply the Laplace Transform to Both Sides  Apply the Laplace transform to both sides: Using standard rules:    Step 2: Solve for  Factor out : Then divide:    Step 3: Prepare for an Inverse Transform  Step 3 focuses on rewriting to match inverse Laplace rules. We separate the exponentials:   Let the rational part be: Then:   This means the inverse will take the form: but we must first identify using partial fractions. The details are shown below:  Partial Fraction Decomposition of  Write: Multiply by and group: Match coefficients:          So:     This completes Step 3. We'll now apply the inverse transform.   Step 4: Invert to Recover  We now compute: By rule , this gives: where:   Substitute:   This is the complete solution for all .       where     Step 1 — Into the Laplace Domain  Recall that our first step is to apply the Laplace transform of both sides:   It's clear how to handle the left-side, but the right-side requires the transform of a piecewise function. Before we can use the rules we derived in this chapter, we first need to write in unit step form.  Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation:   The forcing function is active only from to , so we rewrite it using a unit step window:   Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the DE: On the left-hand side, using , we have:   On the right-hand side, distribute the Laplace transform: Use the shift rule for each term: Now apply linearity and known transforms: So:   Combining both sides, we arrive at the Laplace equation: This completes Step 1.  Now that we've built the Laplace equation, the remaining steps are familiar. We'll solve for , simplify, and invert. But there's one twist: the presence of terms means we'll need special care when taking the inverse Laplace transform. Let's explore that next.    Step 2 — Solving in the Laplace Domain    Step 3 — Leaving the Laplace Domain  Once we've solved for in the Laplace domain, the final challenge is to take the inverse Laplace transform. When the forcing function was continuous, this step relied on partial fractions and matching terms from the Laplace table. That still works here, but now we'll also see terms involving exponentials like .  These exponentials come directly from transforming unit step expressions. To move back to the -domain, we need a new tool: a rule that undoes the exponential shift.       where    Roadmap-Summary               2️⃣ Solve for                 3️⃣ Prepare for               Preparation — Forcing Function in Step Form  We begin by rewriting with unit step functions. Since it equals on , on , and after :   which simplifies to:     Step 1 — Into the Laplace Domain  Take the Laplace transform of both sides: Using the initial conditions and , the left side becomes: Apply L to each step term: This gives the Laplace-domain equation:     Step 2 — Solve for  Factor out and divide through by :   To prepare for inversion, write:  where  We'll find so we can invert .

This turns OFF at , which is the opposite of what we want.       That's right, flips ON at and stays ON from there.       Close! This is also correct, but we prefer to write it as for clarity in this context.       This turns ON from to , then OFF. Not what we want here.      Unit Step Behavior   What is the only possible set of values that any unit step function can take?     {1 only}  Unit step functions are OFF before , so they can also be 0.    {0, 1}  Correct! Unit step functions are always either 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON).    {any real number}  No, unit step functions are discrete switches, not continuous functions.    {any nonnegative number}  Even though the values are nonnegative, only 0 and 1 are ever used.     Rewriting an ON Interval   Which expression represents a function that is ON from to and OFF otherwise?      This expression turns ON at and back OFF at .     This stays ON after , but never switches OFF at .     This is ON before , but never turns ON at .     That would actually be negative during the interval from to , not what we want.     Multiplying by a Step Function   What is the effect of multiplying a function by ?     It shifts 6 units to the left.  Shifting the input would require , not multiplication by .    It keeps OFF before and turns it ON at .  Correct. acts as a switch that activates at .    It subtracts 6 from the output of .  Step functions don't affect the output directly, they control when the function is active.    It delays by 6 units.  Delaying would require rewriting the input as , not just multiplying by .

This isn't a correct transformation of a step function, it doesn't match the form.     This inverts the formula incorrectly, look carefully at the units and exponents.     Using the Shift Rule   Suppose . What is ?      This is the shift rule in action: delay the function, then shift its input left.     The exponent should be negative, delaying adds .     This shifts the function right but doesn't match the form used in the shift rule.     The Laplace transform applies to the whole product, you can't apply it to one piece separately.

Before we can use the rules we derived in this chapter, we first need to write in unit step form.  Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation:   The forcing function is active only from to , so we rewrite it using a unit step window:   Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the DE: On the left-hand side, using , we have:   On the right-hand side, distribute the Laplace transform: Use the shift rule for each term: Now apply linearity and known transforms: So:   Combining both sides, we arrive at the Laplace equation: This completes Step 1.  Now that we've built the Laplace equation, the remaining steps are familiar. We'll solve for , simplify, and invert.

Step 2 — Solving in the Laplace Domain    Step 3 — Leaving the Laplace Domain  Once we've solved for in the Laplace domain, the final challenge is to take the inverse Laplace transform. When the forcing function was continuous, this step relied on partial fractions and matching terms from the Laplace table. That still works here, but now we'll also see terms involving exponentials like .  These exponentials come directly from transforming unit step expressions.

  "title": "Introduction to Systems",
  "body": " Introduction to Systems   When we first started studying differential equations, we focused on one equation and one dependent variable . But the real world is rarely that simple. Populations of predators and prey change together, chemical reactions involve several substances interacting, and mechanical systems often involve multiple moving parts.  In this chapter, we'll explore what happens when more than one quantity is changing at once — and how we can describe that with systems of differential equations .    What Are Systems?  A system of differential equations is exactly what it sounds like: a collection of differential equations that must be solved together . Instead of tracking a single unknown function, we track several unknowns — and they may influence each other.  For example, consider two unknown functions, and , governed by:   Here and describe how each quantity changes over time — possibly depending on the other quantity. This setup is common in science and engineering because many real-world situations involve several connected variables evolving at the same time.   How Are They Different?  Unlike single equations, systems can include interaction . One variable might depend on another — or they might depend on each other. This can produce richer behaviors like oscillations, balance points, or feedback loops. Solving systems sometimes calls for new tools, like matrix methods, but the ideas will still build on what you already know.  For example, here are some linear systems that have varying levels of dependency between the equations.                         The uncoupled system is no more than two independent differential equations that you have solved before. Far more interesting are the coupled systems, where changes in one variable directly influence changes in the other.     Uncoupled Systems  Let's start simple. Suppose we have two unknowns, and , but they don't influence each other:   These are called uncoupled because the -equation has no and the -equation has no . There's no interaction — they're basically two separate problems packaged together.   📖❓ Example of an Uncoupled System   Solve the uncoupled system:     Each equation can be solved on its own:   Even though they evolve separately, we think of the combined solution as a pair :   You might imagine describing a cup of coffee cooling while describes a soda warming up — two unrelated processes happening side by side.   Solution trajectories in the phase plane for the uncoupled system , . Arrows indicate the direction of motion as time increases.         📖❓ Uncoupled or Not?

  "body": " Interactions Between Variables   In the last section, we saw uncoupled systems , where each equation evolved completely on its own. But many real-world systems aren't so tidy. Often one quantity affects another — or they push on each other in both directions.  In this section, we'll step up the complexity: first looking at systems where one variable drives another, and then meeting the case where both variables interact fully.    Partially Coupled Systems  Suppose we have two variables, and , but this time depends on . In other words, evolves independently, while  listens to .  Here's an example:   Notice what's happening: follows a simple exponential decay. Meanwhile, is influenced by two things — its own decay and whatever value has at the time. This is called a partially coupled system: one-way interaction.   Solving a Partially Coupled System   Solve the system:      Step 1: Solve the independent equation for . This is a familiar exponential decay:    Step 2: Substitute into the -equation:   This is a linear first-order equation. Use an integrating factor to solve:   Multiply by and rewrite the left side as a derivative:   Integrate:   Solve for :   Use the initial condition :   So the solution is:    decays smoothly, while rises briefly (pulled by ) before eventually decaying as well. This one-way influence is the hallmark of a partially coupled system.     📖❓ Partially Coupled Equations   📖❓ Partial Coupling is One-Way   In a partially coupled system, one variable affects the other, but not vice versa.    Exactly. In these systems, one equation is independent and can be solved first. The second equation depends on the first.     📖❓ Which Should You Solve First?   You are given the system: Which equation should you solve first?     , because it depends on both variables.  Not quite. You need to know before you can solve for .

Solve the independent equation for first, then use that in the equation for .    Neither equation can be solved until both are known.  Actually, this is a one-way system, drives , not the other way around.        Fully Coupled Systems (Conceptual)  We've seen systems where nothing interacts (uncoupled) and where one quantity drives another (partially coupled). Now we reach the most intricate case: fully coupled systems .  In a fully coupled system, both variables affect each other. Neither equation stands alone — any change in alters 's future, and feeds back into .  Consider:   Here, and are fully entangled — you can't solve one without the other. Instead of peeling off one equation at a time, we'll eventually treat the system as a single object.   📖❓ What Makes It Fully Coupled ?   What must be true for a system to be fully coupled?     Both equations involve both variables.    Each equation has only one variable.  That would actually make the system uncoupled.    One equation is independent, and the other depends on it.  That's partially coupled, not fully coupled.       🤔💭 Understanding Partially Coupled Systems   🤔💭 Identify the Coupling   Consider the system: Which of the following statements are true?     evolves independently of .    is influenced by .

Their algebraic form is simple enough for exact analysis, yet flexible enough to model everything from harmonic oscillators to interacting populations. Our first task is to define what “linear” means and show how a short piece of matrix notation can replace a page-full of equations.    What Makes a System Linear?  A system is linear if every equation is linear with respect to its dependent variables (all to the power of one). For two variables and general form is   where , , , and are constants.

From Two to Dimensions  For variables a constant-coefficient linear system reads   The dimension of the system equals the length of . Our focus this chapter remains on the planar case ( ) where geometry and algebra meet most clearly.  The number of dependent variables is called the dimension of the system.

We'll begin with the classic trick that worked for single equations — guessing exponential solutions — then finish by showing how to approximate solutions step by step with a numerical method.    Numerical Solutions for Linear Systems  Not every system is easy to solve exactly. Sometimes, you just want to see what the solution looks like — or approximate it for a while. That's where numerical methods shine.  One of the simplest is Euler's Method , which you've seen for single equations. We'll now apply it to systems.

  "title": "Qualitative Methods",
  "body": " Qualitative Methods     Phase Planes and Direction Fields  One of the best ways to understand a system — especially a linear one — is to see it .  The phase plane is a two-dimensional space where we plot one variable on the horizontal axis and the other on the vertical axis. A solution to the system becomes a trajectory — a path through the plane traced as time flows.  To see the push of the system without fully solving it, we can draw a direction field (or slope field): at each point , we sketch a small arrow showing the vector .   Phase Portrait of an Uncoupled System   Consider the uncoupled system:   In the phase plane, every trajectory moves straight toward the origin — and are simply decaying independently, so the arrows point inward along both axes.    For more interesting systems — like ones with partial or full coupling — the direction field can show curved paths, spirals, or saddle-shaped flows. This visual approach helps us predict system behavior even before we dive into equations.    Visualization Tools  So far, we've seen examples of systems where variables evolve independently or influence each other. Now let's step back and look at how to visualize a system as a whole.  The phase plane is a two-dimensional space where we plot one variable on the horizontal axis and the other on the vertical axis. A solution to a system like   becomes a curve in the plane: a path that the system traces over time. We often call this a trajectory .  Instead of plotting and separately, we visualize the pair moving through the plane.  To understand how the system behaves without solving it, we can draw a slope field or direction field : a grid of arrows showing the direction of motion at each point.  Each arrow represents the vector at a point . Together, they show how the system wants to evolve.   Phase Portrait of an Uncoupled System   Consider the system:   The phase portrait shows straight-line motion toward the origin along both axes, because each variable decays independently.    In more interesting systems, like partially coupled ones, the slope field reveals how the variables influence each other.   Phase Portrait of a Partially Coupled System   For the system:   The phase portrait shows decaying, and temporarily increasing in response before decaying, reflecting the one-way interaction.    Phase portraits help us understand the big picture: where solutions are headed, whether they spiral, diverge, or settle down.  Euler's Method Visualized   This interactive slope field shows the direction of motion for the system , . Each arrow represents the vector at that location.                📤 Wrap-Up  Summary    The phase plane shows a system's behavior as a path in the plane.  A slope field shows the direction of motion at each point, based on the system's right-hand sides.  These tools help us understand how the variables interact, even before solving the system.        Qualitative Behavior of Systems  Once we start looking at direction fields, patterns emerge:  Some systems push every solution toward a single point (stable equilibrium). Others send trajectories outward (unstable). Some cause spirals, as if the solution is both rotating and growing or shrinking at the same time.  Even without solving a system, we can often describe these behaviors by looking at the arrows in the phase plane:   Straight decay : trajectories slide smoothly toward the origin.  Saddles : some trajectories are drawn in, others are pushed away.  Spirals : solutions curve inward or outward in looping paths.   Later, we'll connect these patterns to the algebra of the system's coefficients. But even now, these big picture behaviors help us think about what the math is saying.    🤔💭 Qualitative Methods for Linear Systems Reading Questions   🤔💭 Linear or Not?   Decide whether each system is linear or nonlinear.         The product and the square make this nonlinear.        The term makes this nonlinear.      🤔💭 Defining Features   What must be true for a system to be called linear ?     The unknowns and their derivatives appear without products, powers, or nonlinear functions.    All coefficients must be positive.  Sign of coefficients doesn't determine linearity — their form does.    The system must contain exactly two equations.  Systems can have more than two equations and still be linear.      🤔💭 What Does the Phase Plane Show?   Select all statements that describe what a phase plane diagram shows.     The trajectory of the system as moves through time.    The direction of motion at each point (if we draw a direction field).    Only the values of over time, ignoring .  The phase plane shows both variables as a path in 2D space.    Exact solutions for every initial condition.  The phase plane shows motion qualitatively — we don't always solve for explicit formulas.      🤔💭 Recognizing Patterns   Match each description to the type of behavior it suggests.     Trajectories loop inward toward the origin → Spiral sink    Some arrows point toward the origin, others point away → Saddle    All trajectories move straight toward the origin → Stable node    Trajectories go in circles forever → This always means the system is nonlinear.  Not true — linear systems can also produce closed loops or spirals.      🤔💭 Benefits of Vector Form   Why might we rewrite a system as ?     It organizes the system neatly as a single equation.    It connects the system to linear algebra tools like eigenvalues.    It makes the system nonlinear.  No — writing it in vector form doesn't change linearity.    It means we no longer have to think about and separately.  Vector form is a tool for structure, but we still care about each variable's behavior.      "

One equation is independent and can be solved first.  Yes, this is a defining feature of partial coupling.    Both equations must be solved simultaneously.  No, only fully coupled systems require that.    The dependent equation uses the solution of the independent one.  Exactly. You substitute into the second equation to solve for .    Partial coupling means both variables evolve independently.  That describes an uncoupled system, not a partially coupled one.    Only one of the equations involves both variables.  Correct. The coupling only appears in one direction.    The second variable can be solved without knowing the first.

Solve each equation separately, then combine the answers into a pair .    Rewrite the system as a second-order equation for just one variable.  You could do this in some cases, but for uncoupled systems it's simpler to solve each one directly.    Use Euler's Method only — they cannot be solved exactly.

Suppose a mixture containing 0.3 kg of sugar per liter runs into a tank initially filled with 400 L of water containing 2 kg of sugar. The liquid enters at 10 L\/min,the mixture is kept uniform by stirring, and the mixture flows out at the same rate.  Answer the following:  Find the mass of sugar in the tank after minutes.  Find the concentration of sugar in the tank after 10 minutes.  Use your answer to question to determine the concentration of sugar in the tank after a long time. Does your answer make sense in terms of the physical scenario? Explain.       A brine solution of salt flows at a constant rate of 4 L\/min into a large tank that initially he of pure water. The solution inside the tank is kept well-stirred and flows out of the tank at a rate of 3 L\/min. Suppose the concentration of salt in the brine entering the tank is kg\/L. Then  Determine the mass of the salt in the tank afte minutes.  What is the concentration of salt after one hour?              From a Second-Order Equation to a System   Rewrite the second-order equation as a system of first-order equations.    Let and . Then:   and   So the system becomes:       Two large tanks, each holding 100 L of liquid, are interconnected by pipes, with the liquid flowing from tank 1 into tank 2 at a rate of 3 L\/min and from tank 2 into tank 1 at a rate of 1 L\/min. The liquid inside each tank is kept well-stirred. A brine solution with salt concentration of 0.01 kg\/L flows into tank 1 at a rate of 4 L\/min. The (diluted) solution flows out of the system from tank 1 at 2 L\/min and from tank 2 at 2 L\/min.Initially, tank 1 contains pure water and tank 2 contains 6 kg of salt.     Write a system of differential equations for (the amount of salt, in kg, in tank 1 at tim )an (the amount of salt, in kg, in tank 2 at tim ).    We consider the rate of change in the amount of salt in tank 1. Similarly, we consider the rate of change in the amount of salt in tank 2. Hence, our system is:            How many initial conditions will you need to find a particularsolution? Write the initial conditions.

A tank contains 100 liters of water. Salt is being added at a rate of 5 grams per minute. If the mixture is kept uniform by stirring and salt is being removed from the tank at a rate of 2 liters per minute, set up the differential equation that models the amount of salt \\(y(t)\\) in the tank at any time \\(t\\).   Let \\(y(t)\\) be the amount of salt in the tank at time \\(t\\). The rate of change of salt with respect to time, \\(\\frac{dy}{dt}\\), is given by the rate of salt coming in minus the rate of salt going out. The rate of salt coming in is 5 grams\/minute. The concentration of salt in the tank is \\(\\frac{y(t)}{100 - 2t}\\) and thus the rate at which salt is removed from the tank is \\(2 \\times \\frac{y(t)}{100 - 2t}\\).

Uncoupled      Partially Coupled     Fully Coupled      📖❓ Identifying Features   Select all statements that are true about partially coupled systems.     One equation is independent and can be solved first.  Yes, this is a defining feature of partial coupling.    Both equations must be solved simultaneously.  No, only fully coupled systems require that.    The dependent equation uses the solution of the independent one.  Exactly. You substitute into the second equation to solve for .    Partial coupling means both variables evolve independently.  That describes an uncoupled system, not a partially coupled one.    Only one of the equations involves both variables.  Correct. The coupling only appears in one direction.    The second variable can be solved without knowing the first.  Nope, you need to solve for .      📖❓ Select the True Statements   Which of the following statements are true for the system:      The rate of change of depends on .    The variable has no effect on how changes.    The rate of change of depends only on .    This is an example of a coupled system.    This system has two independent variables.      📖❓ Independent Solutions   In an uncoupled system, how do we find the solution for the whole system?     Solve each equation separately, then combine the answers into a pair .    Rewrite the system as a second-order equation for just one variable.  You could do this in some cases, but for uncoupled systems it's simpler to solve each one directly.    Use Euler's Method only — they cannot be solved exactly.  Uncoupled systems are straightforward to solve exactly.     "

For example, the characteristic equation associated with a linear differential equation like is a quadratic. Understanding how to solve quadratics is essential for finding solutions to these types of problems.  A quadratic equation has the general form , where . There are several common techniques to solve such equations:   Factoring : Try to express the quadratic as a product of two binomials.  Quadratic formula : Use the general formula .  Completing the square : Rewrite the quadratic to form a perfect square trinomial.   Each method has its advantages. Factoring is often the quickest when possible. The quadratic formula works for all cases and is especially useful when the equation doesn't factor easily. Completing the square is less commonly used early on, but becomes more important in later topics, such as solving differential equations by variation of parameters or Laplace transforms.  Let's look at a few examples that illustrate all three methods.   Repeated Root  Solve .    Factoring: Try factoring directly:   This gives a repeated root, also called a double root.  Quadratic formula:   Completing the square:          Two Real Roots  Solve .    Factoring:   Quadratic formula:          Complex Roots  Solve .

While this form is helpful, there’s another version that plays a more direct role in differential equations: the point-slope form . It’s especially useful when we know a point on the line and the slope, which is exactly the situation we encounter in slope fields and Euler’s method.  Recall the formula for the slope between two points, and : Rearranging this gives the point-slope form of a line:   This form is powerful when modeling rates of change. For instance, when approximating solutions to differential equations numerically, each step follows the slope of a tangent line—exactly what this formula captures.

  "title": "Function Notation",
  "body": " Function Notation  Function notation is a cornerstone of modern mathematics and science. It allows us to describe relationships between variables in a compact, precise, and flexible way. While the concept may seem familiar, mastering its nuances is essential for understanding differential equations and the systems they model.  A function is a rule that assigns exactly one output value to each input. For example, takes an input , squares it, and returns the result. The notation not only names the function but also reminds us which variable it depends on.  In the context of differential equations, function notation frequently appears with derivatives—expressions like or describe how a quantity changes. These are the building blocks for modeling motion, population growth, heat flow, electrical current, and countless other processes.   Evaluating a Function  Suppose . To find , substitute :   This tells us that when the input is 4, the function outputs 11.   Function notation also makes it easy to represent more complex relationships. For instance, in the differential equation , we describe how the rate of change of depends both on the independent variable and the dependent variable through two separate functions.   Function Composition  Consider and . The composition means we evaluate first, then plug the result into :   This compact notation is especially useful in modeling layered or dependent processes.   Initial conditions often appear alongside function notation in differential equations. For example, if and , the function must satisfy both the differential equation and this initial value.   Function Notation in Initial Value Problems  Solve the initial value problem: First, find the general solution: Now use the initial condition: So the particular solution is:    Function notation also plays a central role in the structure of higher-order differential equations, where derivatives and coefficients are expressed using functional relationships.  Consider the general form: This describes how a function evolves over time, incorporating both its derivatives and time-dependent coefficients. Let’s break down the components.   Key Components of Function Notation  1. The Function : indicates that is a function of time . For example, might represent the temperature at time , or the position of an object in motion.  2. Derivatives : The term refers to the th derivative of with respect to . Derivatives describe how a quantity changes. For example:  is the rate of change (velocity).  is the second derivative (acceleration).    3. Coefficients and Forcing Terms : The functions and modify the behavior of the system. For example:  scales the function based on time.  represents an external input or forcing term.      Interpreting an Equation  Let’s analyze this second-order differential equation:   is the second derivative—how fast the rate of change is changing.  is a damping term proportional to velocity.  scales the function itself.  is a forcing term that decays over time.  These components together describe a system with internal resistance and an external influence.  When interpreting a differential equation, ask:  What is the order of the highest derivative?  Are the coefficients constant or variable?  Is there a forcing term (like ) driving the system?  These questions help you understand the system’s structure and behavior.    Breaking Down an Equation  Consider: This is a first-order differential equation. The rate of change of depends on both and . We can separate the variables: Recognizing this structure makes it easier to solve.   In summary, function notation is more than a way to write formulas—it’s a powerful language for describing change. It allows us to interpret, analyze, and solve differential equations across a wide range of applications.  "

  "body": " Solving Polynomial Equations  Solving polynomial equations is a foundational skill in mathematics, and it plays a critical role in differential equations—particularly when solving linear differential equations with constant coefficients. In that context, we transform the differential equation into a polynomial equation, known as the characteristic equation, and solve it to find exponential solutions.  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  ✳️ Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so   How?  Use polynomial divison to compute                                                                                     Therefore, .    Therefore,     Rational Root Theorem  If a polynomial has rational roots, they must be of the form:   This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.       Example: Solving a Polynomial Equation   Solve the equation:     Try rational roots. Testing gives: So is a factor. Divide the polynomial to find: Factoring the quadratic: The roots are .    Here are a few quick examples. These illustrate techniques like factoring out common terms, recognizing perfect squares, or applying the Rational Root Theorem. All of these help us find roots that lead to solutions of linear homogeneous equations.     Factor and solve the following polynomial equations:                            The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.

Check the Degree of the Numerator and Denominator  Ensure the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. If the numerator has a degree greater than or equal to the denominator, first perform polynomial long division to reduce the degree of the numerator.   Factor the Denominator  Factor the denominator into irreducible linear or quadratic factors.   Linear factors: Expressions of the form .   Irreducible quadratic factors: Expressions of the form where the discriminant is negative.     Set up the Partial Fraction Decomposition  Based on the factors of the denominator, write the decomposition:  For each linear factor , include a term of the form .  For repeated linear factors , include terms like:   For irreducible quadratic factors , include a term of the form .

For example, we might consider the vibration of an airplane wing that is struck by some external object or a circuit that is initially open and then we close the circuit and the current immediately starts flowing. Both of these scenarios would require a piecewise defined function because there is a moment in time when something about the physical system changes.  As such, we need to remember how piecewise defined functions work. Consider the function   If we want to evaluate the function at a particular -value, we use the restrictions on the right to point us to which piece of the function definition we should use. For example, if we want to know , then we look over at that right side and see that 3 falls into the interval so we use the corresponding function, . Thus,   If we want to graph, we also use those restrictions. When , or equivalently when is in the interval we know that the graph of will look like the horizontal line ; on the interval the graph will look like the graph of the parabola ; etc.  In the plots below you can see the entire graphs of the functions, dotted, with a solid segment that will be part of the piecewise function .

Brine is entering the tank at volumetric flow rate Since the tank level does not change, brine must leave at the same rate, 14 L\/min .    14 L\/min     The concentration (in kg\/L) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the figure. At what rate (in kg\/min) is salt entering the tank?   Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of 64 kg\/min .    64 kg\/min     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via two input lines (A and B) and has one output line (C).       If the tank level does not change, what volumetric flow rate must be entering via the input line B?   Brine is leaving the tank at volumetric flow rate 10 gal\/sec. Inlet A contributes 4 gal\/sec, which means that if the tank level is to remain constant, inlet B must contribute 6 gal\/sec .    6 gal\/sec     The concentration (in lb\/gal) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the figure. Assuming the tank level doesn't change, at what rate (in lb\/sec) is salt entering the tank?   Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of 26 lb\/sec .    26 lb\/sec     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via two input lines (A and B) and has one output line (C).       What happens to the level of the tank over time? Be specific.   Liquid is entering at a rate of 7+10 = 17 L\/min. It leaves at a rate of 12 L\/min. That means that the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a rate of 5 L\/min.    increases (volume increases at a rate of 5 L\/min)     If the tank has a capacity of 1500 L, and is empty at time minutes, write a function for volume of liquid in the tank at time minutes.   Since the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a rate of 5 L\/min, we have Since the capacity of the tank is 1500 L, this equation only works for minutes.          Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via one input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).       Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of water that is dark red due to food coloring and that the liquid entering the tank is pure water. Imagine that we allow the pure water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What color would you expect the water in the tank to be after a really long time?   Over time we would expect that the water in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the tank be clear (i.e., pure water).    clear (i.e., pure water)     Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of pure water and that the liquid entering the tank is water that is dark red due to food coloring. Imagine that we allow the dark red water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What color would you expect the water in the tank to be after a really long time?   Over time we would expect that the water in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the tank to have dark red water--the same as the incoming water.    dark red (same as incoming water)     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via an input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).   Suppose the tank initially contains 50 gallons of a salt water solution (also called a brine) with concentration 6 lb\/gal, and that the liquid entering the tank is pure water.    How much salt is initially in the tank?   Initially we have     300 lb     Imagine that we allow the pure water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What concentration of salt do you expect there to be in the tank after a long time?   Initially we have salt in the tank, but over time, no salt is added but the solution is drained, so more and more salt leaves the tank. Over time we would expect that the concentration of salt would decrease to 0 lb\/gal .    0 lb\/gal     How much salt do you expect to be in the tank after a long time? (Note that this is a slightly different question than the previous question.)    Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via one input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).   Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of a brine with concentration 6 kg\/L, and that the liquid entering the tank is a brine with concentration 8 kg\/L.    Imagine that we allow the brine to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What concentration of salt do you expect there to be in the tank after a long time?   Over time we would expect that the fluid in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the concentration of salt to be 8 kg\/L .    8 kg\/L     How much salt do you expect to be in the tank after a long time? (Note that this is a slightly different than asking about the concentration of salt. Hint: use units!)   Since we expect the concentration to be 8 kg\/L, and there are 50 L of solution in the tank (which doesn't change because the volumetric flow rate in is equal to the volumetric flow rate out), then we expect there will be     400 kg      "

The general solution to an LHCC equation consists of a linear combination of all its independent solutions.  The number of independent solutions corresponds to the order of the equation.  An LHCC equation often has multiple exponential solutions, determined by solving the characteristic equation.  The principle of superposition states that any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution.  The general solution is formed by summing all independent exponential solutions with arbitrary coefficients.  The solutions to LHCC equations are exponential functions because their derivatives preserve the same functional form.  The concept of like-terms helps explain why other function types (polynomials, trigonometric functions) do not work.  By substituting an exponential into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for , which determines the general solution.     In this subsection, we developed a framework for solving Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations . We began by exploring why exponential functions serve as the fundamental solutions to these equations, using the concept of like-terms to justify their role.  We then introduced the characteristic equation , which transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into solving a polynomial equation. This method allows us to systematically determine the correct set of fundamental solutions for any LHCC equation.  With this foundation in place, we are now ready to introduce a powerful tool for systematically finding these solutions: the characteristic equation . This algebraic approach allows us to determine the exponential solutions efficiently and will serve as the backbone of our solution methods moving forward.  To build intuition, we will carefully examine the three defining properties of LHCC equations: linearity , homogeneity , and constant coefficients . Each of these characteristics influences the types of solutions that emerge and dictates the methods we use to solve them. By clearly defining and identifying LHCC equations, we lay the groundwork for developing powerful solution techniques in the sections that follow.  Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a highly structured solution method. Their solutions take on a predictable form, allowing us to develop a systematic approach for solving them. Through examples and analysis, we will discover that exponential functions play a central role in solving LHCC equations. By assuming solutions of the form and substituting into the equation, we obtain an algebraic equation for , the characteristic equation . The solutions to this characteristic equation directly determine the general solution to the differential equation.

The characteristic equation provides a systematic way to determine the fundamental solutions.  The general solution consists of all independent exponential solutions, each multiplied by an arbitrary constant.  The number of solutions matches the order of the differential equation.   In summary, a differential equation is classified as an LHCC equation if it satisfies three criteria:   It is linear : each term involves or its derivatives to the first power only.  It is homogeneous : the right-hand side is zero.  It has constant coefficients : the coefficients of and its derivatives do not depend on .   "

The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:   ✳️ Summary of the Key Ideas     Differential Algebraic Equations . The Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation, simplifying the solution process by eliminating derivatives.   Laplace Transform Concept . Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation involves transforming each term by multiplying by and integrating with respect to from to , but is often simplified by directly applying the Laplace operator, .   Linearity Property . The Laplace transform is linear, meaning it distributes across addition and subtraction, and allows for constants to be factored out. This property is essential for transforming complex equations.   Transforming Initial Conditions . Initial conditions are incorporated directly into the Laplace-transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include initial values, making it easier to solve the resulting algebraic equation.   Common Function Transforms . The Laplace transforms of common functions, such as exponentials, sines, cosines, and polynomials, are essential tools in transforming differential equations and are summarized in the provided table.   Transforming Derivatives . The Laplace transform of a derivative, or higher, transfers the derivative onto the Laplace variable , reducing the order of the equation while introducing initial condition terms.   Multiplication by and . When multiplying a function by an exponential , the Laplace transform shifts by in the -domain, and multiplying by corresponds to differentiating the transform times with respect to , introducing a sign change.   Transforming the Entire Equation .

  "body": "Laplace Transforms  Key Terms & Concepts  In this section, we introduced the concept of the forward Laplace transform and derived some common Laplace transforms that we will use throughtout this chapter. The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:   ✳️ Summary of the Key Ideas   Laplace Transform Method    Common Forms: A table of common Laplace transforms is provided, which doubles as a reference for inverse transforms. The focus is on recognizing forms that match the table entries for functions like , and others.   Direct Computation: When the function of directly matches a form in the common Laplace transform table, the inverse Laplace transform can be easily computed.   Modifying Functions: When a function doesn't match a known form, minor modifications, such as multiplying by missing constants or splitting fractions, can help.   Completing the Square: When dealing with quadratic expressions in the denominator, especially when the discriminant is negative, completing the square can transform the expression into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms. Several examples demonstrate this technique.   Partial Fraction Decomposition: For more complex rational functions, partial fraction decomposition breaks down the function into simpler fractions that match the common transform forms.     Matching Guide: -function Inverse Transform      Denominator Form  Example  Transform           L            L            L            L            L            L            L            L      Tips for Preparing the Backward Transform  Completing the square is an essential technique for transforming quadratic expressions that don't directly match a form in the table of common Laplace transforms. However, it's not the only strategy available. In this section, we'll explore another important technique: partial fraction decomposition. This method is useful for breaking down complex fractions into simpler components that can each be matched with forms in the Laplace transform table.  Two other forms we may wish to match when we study Laplace transforms are As before, we work toward making the denominator match first , and then we sort out the numerator second.  When we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function with a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, we may complete the square or we may do a partial fraction decomposition. How will we know which is appropriate? Here are a few guidelines for you to consider.  Does the denominator factor in an obvious way? If so, factor the denominator and do a partial fraction decomposition if necessary.  If the denominator does not factor in an obvious way, try completing the square.  If you end up with addition outside of the parentheses, as in then you should aim to match and\/or .  If instead you end up with subtraction outside the parentheses, as in then you should factor and do a partial fraction decomposition. You may consider using the quadratic formula if the factorization is not obvious to you.  If you end up with no terms outside the parentheses, as in then use .      "
