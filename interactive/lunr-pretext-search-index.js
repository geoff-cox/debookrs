  "title": "What is a Differential Equation?",
  "body": " What is a Differential Equation?     üéß Listen In this section, we'll explore what a differential equation is, starting with an analogy, and then moving to a formal definition.     Connection to Algebra and Calculus  To learn something new, it helps to connect it to something you already know. So let's begin by linking differential equations to algebra.  Suppose you're asked to solve each of the following equations for :   The goal of algebra is to figure out what number or function goes in place of to make both sides equal. Instead of guessing, you learned rules for isolating . If we apply those rules, we get:   Now suppose you're asked to solve a new equation:   As before, we isolate , giving:   So what function has a derivative of ? In other words, what goes in place of to make this equation true?  From calculus, you might recognize this as an anti-derivative problem. So the solution is:   Believe it or not, you just solved a differential equation using algebra and calculus! Most problems won't be quite that straightforward, but the goal is the same: find a function that fits in place of and makes the equation true.    Definition    üéß Listen Essentially, a differential equation is any equation where the unknown has a derivative applied to it. The formal definition is as follows:    Differential Equation      üìù Note: DE ODE  üìå Since this text only covers ODEs, any use of DE will mean ODE .  A differential equation (DE) is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function. If the function depends on a single variable, the equation is an ordinary differential equation (ODE) . Otherwise, it is called a partial differential equation (PDE) .     For an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include both a derivative (like or ) and an equals sign. This helps us identify the following as differential equations:    üìñ‚ùì Not Required for a DE  Which of the following is NOT required for an equation to be classified as a differential equation?    A -variable  Correct! A -variable is not a requirement for a differential equation.    An unknown function  Incorrect. A differential equation does include an unknown function, which we are solving for.    One or more derivatives of an unknown function  Incorrect. The presence of at least one derivative is essential to define a differential equation.    An equal sign, \"=\"  Incorrect. An equality sign is required for an equation to be classified as a differential equation.     In contrast, these are not differential equations, they either lack a derivative or an equals sign:    üìñ‚ùì Identifying the Differential Equation  Which of the following equations is a differential equation.     Correct! This equation involves a derivative, making it a differential equation.     Incorrect. This equation does not contain any derivatives, so it is not a differential equation.     Incorrect. This equation does not contain any derivatives, so it is not a differential equation.     Incorrect. This equation does not contain any derivatives, so it is not a differential equation.       Common Derivative Notations  In this text, we will use the following notations for derivatives:   üìù Note: Notation  üìå Be careful not to mistake as raised to the power of 4.  üìå Dot Notation is normally reserved for derivatives with respect to time.                                             üìñ‚ùì Understanding Derivative Notation  The expression is the same as to the power of 18.    True  Incorrect. Please read the note on derivative notation.    False  Correct!            üì§ Wrap-Up    üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..  üéß Listen   A differential equation involves an unknown function and at least one of its derivatives.  It must contain an equals sign to be considered an equation.  Differential equations are a natural extension of algebra and calculus.  Notation varies by context but generally falls into prime, Leibniz, or dot notation.      "

  "body": " Differential Equation Components   Now that you can recognize a differential equation, it's time to look more closely at what it's made of. In this section, we'll break down the core components of a differential equation and explain the role each one plays in shaping it.    Dependent and Independent Variables  Every differential equation involves dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable is a function that depends on the independent variable and is the unknown function we're solving for. Because of this, the dependent variable always has derivatives applied to it, with respect to the independent variable.  üìñ‚ùì Which Variable has the Derivative   In a differential equation, you would expect to see a derivative applied to the dependent variable.      True    Correct! The dependent variable in a differential equation always has a derivative applied to it.      False    Incorrect. By definition, a differential equation involves derivatives of the dependent variable.      For example, the differential equation: has as the dependent variable, it's the unknown function. Since the equation includes , that tells us is changing with respect to , making the independent variable.  üìñ‚ùì Dependent vs. Independent   Which variable in the differential equation, , represents the unknown function we would like to find?     dependent variable,    Incorrect. is neither the dependent variable, nor what we are solving for.     independent variable,    Incorrect! is the independent variable, but it is not what we are solving for.     dependent variable,    Yes! We are solving for the unknown, which is the dependent variable in this equation.     independent variable,    Incorrect. We are solving for , but it is not the independent variable.      Identifying the dependent variable not only tells us what we're solving for, but it will also be an important part of determining which methods can be used to solve a differential equation.   Identify the Variables   Identify the dependent and independent variable in each equation:     The first equation contains and , but the presence of implies changes as changes. So,  is the unknown function we solve for that depends on .  dependent variable  , independent variable  .    The middle equation contains and , but is the second derivative of . So, must change as changes and  is the unknown function we solve for that depends on .  dependent variable  , independent variable  .    Only appears in the last equation, but indicates that is changing and so it must be the dependent variable . Typically, the independent variable will be clear from context of the problem, but in this case just assume whatever variable you like.     üìñ‚ùì Identify the Unknown   For each differential equation, identify the variable that represents the solution      Answer:        Answer:        Answer:        \\s*m\\s*  Yes, the solution to the differential equation is the dependent variable .    \\s*M\\s*  No, is not the same as .    \\s*t\\s*  No, is what the solution depends on, but it is not the solution itself.    .*  Incorrect. Carefully review the reading and try again.      \\s*P\\s*  Yes, the solution to the differential equation is the dependent variable .    \\s*p\\s*  No, is not the same as .    \\s*Q\\s*  No. Carefully look at which variable has the derivative applied to it.    .*  Incorrect. That's not a variable in the equation.      \\s*x\\s*  Yes, the solution to the differential equation is the dependent variable .    \\s*X\\s*  No, is not the same as .    \\s*y\\s*  No. Carefully look at which variable has the derivative applied to it.    .*  Incorrect. That's not a variable in the equation.        Terms of a Differential Equation  The word term is commonly used to describe a part of a mathematical expression. In a differential equation, a term refers to any part of the expression separated by plus ( ) or minus ( ) signs. For example, an equation might be structured like this: This equation has three terms on the left-hand side and two on the right.  Terms may include the dependent variable, its derivatives, constants, or other functions of the independent variable. If a term does not include the dependent variable or its derivatives, it is called a constant term . For instance, in the differential equation:   the terms break down as follows:     term   term   term   term   constant term                  üìñ‚ùì What is the Constant Term?   Identify the constant term in the differential equation         Incorrect. This term contains a derivative of the dependent variable , so it is not a constant term.       Incorrect. This term involves the dependent variable , so it is not a constant term.       Correct! is the constant term because it does not contain the dependent variable .     Every differential equation has a constant term, even if it's not written explicitly. For example, can be rewritten as , where the constant term is . In general, any missing term can always be interpreted as a zero term.   üìñ‚ùì Hidden Constant Term   Identify the constant term of the differential equation         Incorrect. This term involves the dependent variable , so it is not a constant term.       Incorrect. This term involves the dependent variable , so it is not a constant term.       Correct! The constant term is because we can rewrite the equation as .    This equation does not have a constant term.  Incorrect. Every DE has a least one constant term.       Coefficients of a Differential Equation  A coefficient in a differential equation is a constant or function (depending only on the independent variable) that multiplies the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. Coefficients help determine the structure of the equation and what solution methods are possible.  For example, in the equation: the coefficients of , , and are the constants , , and , respectively.  Coefficients can also be functions of the independent variable. In the equation: the coefficients are the functions of the independent variable :                üìñ‚ùì Coefficient of   Identify the coefficient of in the differential equation         Incorrect, is only part of the coefficient of .       Correct! is the coefficient of the term involving .       Incorrect, is only part of the coefficient of .       Incorrect. is the constant on the right-hand side of the equation.     In general, for something to be considered a coefficient, it must not involve the dependent variable. If it does, the equation is nonlinear, and the notion of a \"coefficient\" becomes less useful. We'll explore this idea further when we study linear and nonlinear equations.       üì§ Wrap-Up   üéß Listen   üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..   Every differential equation involves two variables: a dependent variable (the unknown function we're solving for) and an independent variable (the variable it depends on).  A term is any part of a differential equation separated by plus or minus signs. Terms can include derivatives, the dependent variable, constants, or other functions of the independent variable.  A constant term is any term that doesn't involve the dependent variable or its derivatives, even a hidden on one side of the equation counts.  A coefficient is a constant or function of the independent variable that multiplies the dependent variable or its derivatives. In nonlinear equations, this idea may not apply in a meaningful way.     Check Your Understanding   üìñ‚ùì Identify the Coefficients   Click on each of the coefficients in the differential equation below.                                Look for the dependent variable in each term. The coefficient is the constant or function that multiplies the dependent variable.       "

  "body": " Order & Linearity   So far, we've learned how to identify the core parts of a differential equation, its variables, terms, and coefficients. Now we'll turn to how differential equations are classified based on how these components appear. In this section, we'll focus on two of the most important classifications: the equation's order , which tells us the highest derivative involved, and its linearity , which depends on how the dependent variable and its derivatives appear in each term. Both properties play a central role in determining what kinds of solution methods apply.    Order  A differential equation must contain at least one derivative, but there's no limit on how many derivatives can appear. Some equations involve just a first derivative, while others include higher-order derivatives like , , or beyond.  To capture this idea, we define the order of a differential equation as the highest derivative of the dependent variable that appears in the equation.   üìñ‚ùì What is the Order   The order of a differential equation is determined by the number of terms it contains      True    Incorrect. The order is based on the highest derivative, regardless of the number of terms.      False    Correct! The order is determined by the highest derivative, not the number of terms.      For example, the equation is a first-order differential equation because the highest derivative is . On the other hand, the differential equation is third-order because it contains up to three derivatives in the term.   üìñ‚ùì Select the Third-Order Equation   Which of the following equations is a third-order differential equation?           Correct! The highest derivative here is the third derivative, making it a third-order differential equation.           Incorrect. This is a second-order differential equation.           Incorrect. This is a second-order differential equation.           Incorrect. This is a first-order differential equation.       Identify the Order   For each of the following differential equations, identify the order:     The first equation is second-order because the highest derivative of is .  A common pitfall for beginners is to confuse exponents with derivatives. In the second equation, the exponent in the term refers to raised to the sixth power, not a sixth derivative. Only derivatives affect the order.  So, the second equation is fifth-order . The fact that it appears inside a sine function makes no difference to the order.     üìñ‚ùì Give the Order of Each Differential Equation   Give the order of each differential equation:      Order:        Order:        Order:        \\s*(2|two|second|second order|second\\-order)\\s*  Correct! The highest derivative is .    \\s*(5|five|fifth)\\s*  Incorrect.

The highest derivative is .    \\s*(2|two|second)\\s*  Incorrect. Carefully review the definition of order and do not confuse the power of a variable with the order.    .*  Carefully review the definition of order.        Linear Terms  To decide whether a differential equation is linear, we first need to understand what it means for a term to be linear. In this context, linearity refers to how the dependent variable and its derivatives appear in each term.  Let be the dependent variable. A term is linear if it appears as either: where the coefficient, , can be a constant or a function of the independent variable only, and is the -th derivative of .  For example, the following terms are linear:   The coefficient of the term actually has no affect on whether it's linear, regardless of how complicated appears.   üìñ‚ùì Identify the Coefficient   Each of the following terms is linear. Identify the coefficient in each term:                              \\s*(2t|2\\s*t|2\\s*\\*\\s*t|2\\(t\\))\\s*  Correct! .    \\s*(2|two)\\s*  Incorrect.

Assuming is the dependent variable, some telltale signs that a term is nonlinear include:    or are raised to a power other than 1     e.g.,      or appear inside a nonlinear function     e.g.,       or are multiplied or divided by each other     e.g.,    Let's apply these strategies by breaking down the linearity of each term in the following differential equation:   The terms are:     Nonlinear. This term involves a product of the dependent variable and its derivative, violating the rule that only one can appear in a term.     Linear. The derivative appears by itself and to the first power. The coefficient does not affect linearity.     Nonlinear. The derivative appears inside a nonlinear function, the natural logarithm.     Nonlinear. The dependent variable appears raised to a power other than one.     Linear. This term doesn't involve the dependent variable or any of its derivatives.     üìñ‚ùì Match Each Terms with its Linearity      Directions:    üîπ  Match (by dragging) each term (on the left) to either Linear or Nonlinear.    üîπ  Assume the dependent variable is and the independent variable is .           Linear      Non-Linear Term      See if you can identify the linearity of the terms in the following examples, before looking at the solutions.   Identify the Linearity of the Terms   Determine whether each term in the equation is linear or nonlinear:      Focus on the dependent variable, , and its derivatives.        Focus on the dependent variable, , and its derivatives.         üìñ‚ùì Identify the Nonlinear Terms    For each differential equation, click on all of the nonlinear terms .                                           Linearity  Now that we've defined what it means for a term to be linear, we can describe what it means for an entire differential equation to be linear.  Essentially, a differential equation is linear if every term in the equation is linear . If just one term is nonlinear, the entire equation is nonlinear . We formally define linear differential equations as follows:   üìñ‚ùì What Makes an Equation Linear of Nonlinear   Select the true statement.     An equation is nonlinear if at least one of its terms are nonlinear.  Correct! A differential equation is nonlinear if any of its terms are nonlinear.    An equation is linear if at least one of its terms are linear.  Incorrect. A differential equation needs all of its terms to be linear.    As long as there are more linear terms than nonlinear terms, the equation is linear.  Incorrect.      Linear Differential Equations   A differential equation is linear if it can be written as a sum of linear terms involving the dependent variable and its derivatives:  This structure is known as a linear combination of the dependent variable and its derivatives.   where each is a function of the independent variable only, and is the input or forcing term.    For example, the following differential equations are linear:   Each term involving the dependent variable or its derivatives is linear, none appear raised to a power, inside a function, or multiplied together.  In contrast, the following equations are nonlinear because they include at least one nonlinear term (‚ú∑):   In each case, it only took one term to violate the definition of a linear differential equation.  Let's practice identifying the linearty of entire equations with a few examples.   Identify the Linearity of the Equation   Determine whether each of the following differential equations is linear:     In the first equation, all terms involving or its derivatives appear linearly: So the equation is linear.  In the second equation, the term is nonlinear, since appears in both the numerator and denominator: This makes the entire equation nonlinear.         üì§ Wrap-Up    üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..  üéß Listen   The order of a differential equation is the highest derivative of the dependent variable that appears. Only derivatives, not exponents, affect the order.  A linear term includes exactly one occurrence of the dependent variable or one of its derivatives, raised to the first power and not inside another function. Coefficients do not affect linearity.  A nonlinear term involves a product, quotient, exponent, or function of the dependent variable or its derivatives.  A differential equation is linear if all terms involving the dependent variable are linear. If even one is nonlinear, the entire equation is classified as nonlinear .     Check Your Understanding   üìñ‚ùì Linear System Basics   Identify the Linear Equations   Click-on all the linear differential equations.                   Remember that a linear differential equation contains only linear terms. Four of these equations are linear.    Linear equations only involve the dependent variable and its derivatives to the first power, and they won't be inside nonlinear functions like sine or multiplied by each other.     Identify the Nonlinear Equations   Click-on all the nonlinear differential equations                                  First identify the dependent variable, then carefully look at each term to determine if it is nonlinear. There are six nonlinear equations here.    Nonlinear equations often have terms where the dependent variable or its derivatives are raised to powers other than one, or are inside functions like sine, logarithms, or are multiplied by each other.

  "title": "What is a Solution?",
  "body": " What is a Solution?     üéß Listen A central goal in differential equations is learning how to find their solutions. In fact, most problems you'll encounter begin with a familiar prompt:     Find the solution to the following differential equation.  This \"solve and move on\" mindset can sometimes obscure a deeper, more important question:  What does it actually mean to be a solution to a differential equation?    A solution to a differential equation is not just the outcome of a sequence of mathematical steps; it is a function that fulfills all the criteria of the equation. This section aims to provide a clearer understanding of what it means to be a solution to a differential equation, as well as methods for verifying and visualizing them.    üéß Listen In algebra, a solution is any value that satisfies the algebraic equation. In contrast, a solution to a differential equation is any function that satisfies the differential equation. So, understanding what it means to satisfy a differential equation is the first step toward understanding its solutions.     üìñ‚ùì What Kind of Mathematical Object is a Solution?   In general, a solution to a differential equation is any that satisfies it.     function   Yes, when you solve a differential equation, you are finding a function.     derivative   While derivatives are involved in differential equations, they do not describe solutions in general.     number   It is possible for a solution to be a number, but not in general.     exponential   Exponential functions are common solutions, but they do not represent all solutions in general.       Satisfying an Algebraic Equation    üéß Listen In algebra, we say that a value satisfies an equation if, when we substitute that value in place of the variable, it makes both sides of the equation equal. This gives a true statement, like or .   For example, consider the equation:   Let's check whether and are solutions by substituting them into the equation.  First, try . That's a true statement, so satisfies the equation.  Now check . This is false, so does not satisfy the equation.  To summarize: is a solution to the equation, while is not.    Satisfying a Differential Equation    üéß Listen In differential equations, solutions are functions rather than single values. To verify a solution, we substitute the function into the dependent variable in the equation. If both sides simplify to the same expression, then the function is a solution.   For instance, consider the differential equation:   To check whether or is a solution, we substitute each into the equation and compare both sides.  First, try .   Since these are not the same, does not satisfy the equation.  Now try .   Since both sides match, this is a true statement and is a solution.  Here, a true statement means both sides simplify to the same function. When we substitute , we get different expressions. But when we substitute , both sides match. Technically, we could rewrite as by subtracting one side from the other, but it's enough to see that the functions match directly.   üìñ‚ùì Quick Verification    is a solution to the differential equation .

You can also verify solutions that include constants, as the next examples show.  Verifying Solutions with a Common Form     Show that the functions are all solutions to the differential equation .      Rather than verify each function separately, notice that they all are of the form , where is a constant. Let's verify the general case.  Substitute into the equation: So is a solution for any constant . In particular, this includes the functions for the constants respectively.    Verifying a Solution with Two Constants    Verify that is a solution to .

In differential equations, a solution is a function that satisfies the equation. This means that when you plug it into the dependent variable, both sides simplify to the same expression.  To verify a solution, take any necessary derivatives, substitute into the equation, and simplify. If both sides match, or reduce to something like , then the function is a solution.      "

But shows that a single differential equation can actually have many solutions. That example shows there can be infinitely many solutions, one for each value of the constant in .   To make sense of all these solutions, we classify solutions into three key categories: general solution , particular solution , and family of solutions . Understanding the distinctions between these types is an important part of solving differential equations.    An Analogy  To help clarify the differences between these types of solutions, let's use an analogy.  Imagine a family of solutions as a collection of all possible dates in a year. The general solution is like the format for writing dates, such as mm\/dd\/yyyy . Each particular solution is like a specific date, such as 10\/04\/2039 . The family of solutions would be the entire list of all dates in this format.  Of course, solutions to differential equations aren't dates, but the analogy highlights the idea: the general solution gives the structure, particular solutions are specific instances, and the family includes them all.   üìñ‚ùì Describe the Different Solution Types   Match the word that best describes each type of solution.     Template  General Solution    Specific  Particular Solution    Collection  Family of Solutions       Solution Types  To make sense of all the possible solutions, we classify solutions into three key categories:   General solution:  This includes one or more arbitrary constants, like in . You can think of it as a template from which specific solutions can be generated.   Particular solution:  A particular solution results from assigning a specific value to each arbitrary constant in the general solution. For example, if , then .   Family of solutions:  A family of solutions is the complete collection of particular solutions generated by varying the constants in the general solution.     üìñ‚ùì Describe a Family of Solutions   What is a family of solutions?      A collection of all possible solutions to a differential equation.    Correct! The family of solutions includes every possible particular solution.      The general solution to a differential equation.    Incorrect. The general solution represents a form of the family of solutions, not the entire set.      A single specific solution to a differential equation.    Incorrect. This describes a particular solution, not the family of solutions.      A solution without any constants.    Incorrect. A solution without constants is typically a particular solution, not the entire family.      Consider the equation . The general solution is , and some particular solutions are corresponding to , , and . If we could list every possible value of , we'd have the full family of solutions.   üìñ‚ùì General or Particular   Fill in the following blanks, below, with one of the following terms:  general  particular     Tip: Double-click a term above to quickly highlight it for copying.

A solution is a function that results from assigning specific values to the constants in the solution.         general  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     particular  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     general  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     particular  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     particular  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     general  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     particular  .* There are only two possible answers, did you spell it incorrectly?     Solving a differential equation usually starts with the general solution , which includes one or more arbitrary constants. Remember, each constant can take on any value, which leads to infinitely many possible particular solutions .   Not All Solutions with Constants Are General Solutions ‚ö†Ô∏è  Keep in mind, solutions with arbitrary constants are not general solutions by default. For example, both of the functions are solutions to the equation , but only the second is general solution. The first is a special case of the second, obtained when , so it can be the general solution.     Initial Conditions & Initial-Value Problems (IVPs)  In real-world problems, we often narrow down the set of possible solutions by specifying initial conditions , known values of the solution or its derivatives at a specific point. A differential equation paired with initial conditions is called an initial-value problem (IVP). If enough information is provided, the IVP gives a unique particular solution that satisfies both the equation and the conditions.    üìñ‚ùì Initial Condition Meaning   Assume we have a differential equation with dependent variable and independent variable .  What is an initial condition?      A known value of or a known value of 's derivatives.    Correct! An initial condition specifies the value of the solution or its derivative at a particular point.      The starting value of .    Incorrect. The initial condition is related to the solution or its derivatives at a specific point.      Any point in the -plane.    Incorrect. An initial condition is not just any point; it's a specific point referring to a known value of or one of it's derivatives      The first step in solving a differential equation.    Incorrect. The initial condition is not the initial step for solving a differential equation.       üìñ‚ùì Is it an IVP   The differential equation is an example of an initial-value problem.     True   Incorrect. An initial-value problem must include initial conditions, which are missing here.     False   Correct! This is just a differential equation, without initial conditions, it is not an initial-value problem.       For example, suppose an object is in free fall under constant acceleration . If is its height above the ground, then: The general solution is:   This solution models any object falling under gravity. To describe a specific situation, we apply two initial conditions:   The object is dropped from .  It is dropped from rest with an initial velocity of zero.   In terms of , these conditions become:   Now we substitute the first condition into and the second into :            The resulting particular solution is: which models an object dropped specifically from with no initial velocity.    From General Solutions to Particular Solutions  To find a particular solution, we start with a general solution and apply given initial conditions to determine the values of any constants. The following examples illustrate this process.   Solving for a Constant   Find the particular solution to the initial value problem: given that the general solution is:     The initial condition tells us that must equal 2 when . Substituting into the general solution:   Thus, the particular solution is:      üìñ‚ùì When is your Answer a Particular Solution   In which case would you need to find a particular solution rather than just a general solution?      When the differential equation is linear.    Incorrect. Linearity doesn't determine whether you need a particular solution.      When initial conditions are provided.    Correct! A particular solution is found when you need to satisfy initial conditions.      When the differential equation is has a general solution.    Incorrect. The existence of a general solution doesn't determine whether you need a particular solution.      When the function depends on more than one variable.    Incorrect. Multivariable functions are not the reason for finding a particular solution.      When a general solution contains more than one constant, we need multiple initial conditions to determine them, as the next example shows.   Two Initial Conditions   Verify that the function is a solution to and then find the particular solution satisfying:    Verifying the General Solution  Compute the derivatives:   Substitute into the equation: So is indeed a solution.   Finding the Particular Solution  Apply the initial conditions:          Solve the system: Substituting and solving yields:   The particular solution is:          üì§ Wrap-Up   üéß Listen   üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..   A differential equation can have many solutions, often infinitely many, because the constants in the solution can take on any value.  A general solution includes one or more arbitrary constants and captures all possible solutions in a single form.  A particular solution comes from assigning specific values to those constants.  A family of solutions is the complete set of particular solutions generated by varying the constants in the general solution.   Initial conditions give known values for the solution or its derivatives.  When a differential equation is paired with initial conditions, we call it an initial value problem (IVP).  When we apply these conditions, we can determine the constants in the general solution, resulting in a unique particular solution .      "

Are there any differences in how you verify solutions to differentials equations compared to algebraic equations? Explain.        Explain the Difference..   In few sentences, explain the difference between a general solution, family of solutions, and a particualr solution.      Explain the Significance..   Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the particular and general solution of a differential equation.        Attempt to apply direct integration to the differential equation . Get to the point where it becomes clear that you cannot solve for directly. What is the obstacle?       (a)    To be a solution to the equation, must satisfy the equation. That is, when we substitute into the equation, the result simplifies to a true statement.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is an undeniably true statement, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is not true, so is not a solution to the equation.    The process of verifying solutions to differential equations is exactly the same. However, with differential equations, we have to be more careful about confirming a true statement . With numbers, it is easy to see if is true, but with functions, its a bit more tricky. We have to be sure that the functions are equal for all values of (or the independent variable). For example, the statement is true since . In contrast, the statement is not true since for all values of . It only takes one value of to make the statement false. Let's try a few values of to see this.                                The fact that the statement is not true for is enough to show that this is not a true statement and would not correspond to a solution to a differential equation.     (b)  A general solution represents the form of all possible solutions to a differential equation, typically with one or more arbitrary constants. A family of solutions is an infinite set of solutions, one for each possible combination of constant values in the general solution. A particular solution is a single solution that satisfies the differential equation with specific values for the constants.   (c)  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution. Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   (d)  Integrating both sides gives Without knowing , we cannot simplify . So the obstacle is that we are unable to combine these variables into a single on the left side.

Are there any differences in how you verify solutions to differentials equations compared to algebraic equations? Explain.        Explain the Difference..   In few sentences, explain the difference between a general solution, family of solutions, and a particualr solution.      Explain the Significance..   Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the particular and general solution of a differential equation.        Attempt to apply direct integration to the differential equation . Get to the point where it becomes clear that you cannot solve for directly. What is the obstacle?       (a)    To be a solution to the equation, must satisfy the equation. That is, when we substitute into the equation, the result simplifies to a true statement.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is an undeniably true statement, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.    Substituting into the equation, we get Since is not true, so is not a solution to the equation.    The process of verifying solutions to differential equations is exactly the same. However, with differential equations, we have to be more careful about confirming a true statement . With numbers, it is easy to see if is true, but with functions, its a bit more tricky. We have to be sure that the functions are equal for all values of (or the independent variable). For example, the statement is true since . In contrast, the statement is not true since for all values of . It only takes one value of to make the statement false. Let's try a few values of to see this.                                The fact that the statement is not true for is enough to show that this is not a true statement and would not correspond to a solution to a differential equation.     (b)  A general solution represents the form of all possible solutions to a differential equation, typically with one or more arbitrary constants. A family of solutions is an infinite set of solutions, one for each possible combination of constant values in the general solution. A particular solution is a single solution that satisfies the differential equation with specific values for the constants.   (c)  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution. Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   (d)  Integrating both sides gives Without knowing , we cannot simplify . So the obstacle is that we are unable to combine these variables into a single on the left side.     "

  "title": "Separable Differential Equations",
  "body": " Separable Differential Equations   The method of separation of variables applies only to a special class of first-order differential equations, those that can be written in a particular form. When an equation has this form, it can be rearranged so that integration leads directly to its general solution. So before we can use this powerful method, we first need to learn how to recognize when an equation is separable.    Separable Form  Some differential equations can be rewritten so that all the terms are on one side and all the terms are on the other. These equations are called separable . Let's make that idea precise.  Separable Form   A first-order differential equation is separable if it can be written in following separable form  .    Select-the-Best-Answer   The term separable refers to the idea that the dependent and independent variables can be separated by .      multiplication    Correct!      addition    Read the first sentence of this page.      integration    Read the first sentence of this page.      gender    Really?        What Does Separable Mean?  The notation can be intimidating at first. It compresses a lot of ideas into a small expression. But don't worry, we'll break it down.  In the definition, is just a stand-in for any expression that only involves the variable . For example, it might be:   Likewise, stands for any expression involving only and constants:   So when we say , we just mean any product where one factor depends only on and the other only on . Here are a few made-up examples:     Recognizing Separable Forms  Since the separation of variables method can only be applied to differential equations in separable form, it is crucial to be able to recognize this structure.  Examples of separable differential equations include: Non-separable equations include:   Select-the-Best-Answer   Which of the following differential equations is not separable?           Incorrect. This equation is separable because it can be expressed as a product of functions involving only and .           Incorrect. This equation is separable as the variables are already separated by multiplication.           Correct! This equation is not separable because the terms involving and are added together, not multiplied.           Incorrect. This equation is separable because the variables are divided, which can still be separated into a product of functions.        A Special Separable Form  As a special case, a differential equation can still be separable even if one or both variables do not explicitly appear. For example, the equations , are all separable since they can be written as .  While all three of these are in separable form and can be solved with the separation of variables method, the first and third equations are better suited for direct integration.  True-or-False   The differential equation, , is separable    We can show it is separable by rewriting it as         Click-Answer   Click on each of the separable differential equations below.                                 Remember, a differential equation is separable if you can express it as a product of functions of and separately. Look for equations where the variables are separated by multiplication, not addition or other operations.        Showing An Equation is Separable  Separable equations are often not presented in a separable form . In such cases, you'll need to rewrite the equation to verify it's separable. This process typically involves two main steps:    Isolate the derivative on one side of the equation ,    Then form the product on the other side of the equation . Common algebra techniques to achieve this product include:  Factoring out common terms:  Exponential sums to products :  Rearranging fractions: and        To illustrate this, consider the equation   Here, we isolate and factor out : which shows the differential equation is separable .   Isolate & Rearrange the Fraction   Show that the differential equation is separable.     Since the variables in this equation are and , the separable form will look like .  To get there, we isolate first:   Now, we split the fraction so that and can be separated: So, the equation is separable .     Splitting an Exponential   Show that the differential equation is separable. .    Isolating the derivative and applying leads to the separable form:     Select the Separable Form   How can the equation, below, be rewritten in separable form?       None of the above.    Correct! This equation is not separable, so it is impossible to write it in separable form.           Incorrect. This rewriting does not separate the variables effectively.           Incorrect. This form still combines and terms in a way that is not separable.           Correct! This form separates the variables, making it possible to identify whether the equation is separable.      Flexing Algebra Skills   Show the differential equation is separable.     This example uses a little of everything we discussed, so strap in.  Noticing that the equation is first-order, we start by isolating    Next, we can rewrite the exponent in the numerator as a product and recognize that there is a common factor in the numerator .  From here, we write the result as a product of fractions, , and the equation is now clearly separable .

  "title": "Separation of Variables (SOV) Method",
  "body": " Separation of Variables (SOV) Method   When a differential equation is both first-order and separable , we can reliably find its general solution using the separation of variables method. At its core, this technique involves rewriting the equation so that all terms are grouped on one side and all terms on the other. Once separated, integrating both sides reveals the general solution that needs a bit of clean-up.  The primary challenge in applying this method is often the algebraic steps before and after the integration. First, to get the equation separable form and then isolating the dependent variable down to a clean solution.  This section lays out the general steps of the method and provides several examples to help you master the process, as well as the algebraic and calculus skills that go with it.    Separation of Variable Method Steps  Once you've verified that an equation is separable, solving it becomes a systematic process. Here's the step-by-step outline to follow:   Steps for Using Separation of Variables   Step 1: Verify Separability  (i) Check that your equation is first-order and (ii) can be rearranged into the form    Step 2: Separate and Integrate  (i) Rearrange so that all terms are on one side (with ) and terms are on the other (with ), then (ii) integrate:   (iii) Compute the integrals on both sides.   Step 3: Solve for  If possible, explicitly solve the resulting equation for . If not, leave the solution in implicit form. Remember to combine integration constants when appropriate.       ü§îüí≠ When Does SOV Apply?   Which two properties must a differential equation satisfy in order to solve it using the separation of variables method?      The equation must be linear and separable.    Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation does not need to be linear.      The equation must be first-order and linear.    Incorrect. First-order is required, but the equation does not need to be linear for the separation of variables method to be applied.      The equation must be second-order and separable.    Incorrect. Separable is required, but the equation cannot be second-order for the separation of variables method to be applied.      The equation must be first-order and separable.    Correct! The separation of variables method applies only to first-order differential equations thatare separable.       ü§îüí≠ Place the SOV Tasks in the Correct Order   Place the tasks in the order that they should be performed to find the general solution using separation of variables.  Drag each task on the left to the correct step order on the right.    Review the SOV Method .     Check the DE is first-order  Step 1 (i)    Write DE in separable form:  Step 1 (ii)      Step 2 (i)     Step 2 (ii)    Compute &  Step 2 (iii)    If possible, solve for & combine constants along the way  Step 3      A common practice when using separation of variables is to treat like a fraction, moving and around as if they separate objects. Although not strictly rigorous, this practice is often justified and consistently leads to valid results.  Specifically, when we present the separated integrals in Step 2 as , where it appears as though we integrate one side with respect to and the other with respect to . But more accurately, we are integrating both sides with respect to , using the substitution .  To see this clearly, start from the separable form: Divide both sides by to obtain: Integrating both sides with respect to gives: This justifies the informal integration with respect to different variables.   ü§îüí≠ Integrating Both Sides   Part of the separation of variables method involves integrating each side of the equation with respect to a different variable.    This is false. Although it looks like this is true in SOV: Step 2 , both sides are actually integrated with respect to the same variable, or whatever the independent variable happens to be in the context of the problem.      Basic Examples  Let's begin with a few warm-up problems to build confidence in using separation of variables. The examples that follow are intentionally straightforward, each equation is either already separable or requires minimal algebraic manipulation. As you work through them, keep your focus on identifying the separable form, carefully separating variables, integrating both sides, and explicitly solving for when possible.   ü§îüí≠ Review Separability   Which of the following differential equations are separable?       Is this the product of a function of and ?       Note: .       Moving over you get . Can a sum like this be converted into the form ?       Note, this is a second-order differential equation...       Warm-Up: Basic Separable Equations   Find the general solution to each of the following differential equations using the separation of variables method.     We'll first solve equations (1) and (2) side-by-side to clearly demonstrate each step of the separation of variables method .            Step 1 ‚Äì Verify separability:            Step 2 ‚Äì Separate and integrate:            Step 3 ‚Äì Solve for and combine constants:              Step 1 ‚Äì Rewrite clearly:   Check separability explicitly:    Step 2 ‚Äì Separate variables and integrate:    Step 3 ‚Äì Combine constants and solve explicitly for :        Initial-Value Problems  After finding a general solution to a separable equation, you often need to use an initial condition to identify a specific, or particular , solution. The next example demonstrates clearly how initial conditions help determine the integration constant after applying separation of variables.   Finding a Particular Solution   Find the particular solution to the initial-value problem     This differential equation is first order and separable since So separation of variables applies.    Separate     Integrate       So, the general solution is .  Substituting, , into the general solution, we get   Therefore, the solution to the intial-valued problem is   Be cautious about rewriting constants in decimal form. For instance, if you approximate , the solution becomes: which may not exactly satisfy the original initial condition due to rounding errors. It's usually better to leave constants in exact form.      Implicit Solutions  Sometimes, after integration, it may not be possible or practical to isolate explicitly. Solutions presented in such forms are known as implicit solutions . Although they don't isolate one variable completely, implicit solutions still provide a complete description of the relationship between variables. Let's look at a few examples demonstrating how to handle these situations clearly.   An Implicit Solution   Solve the initial-value problem     Notice the equation already separates naturally once we factor out : .    Separate variables     Integrate       Combine constants   The general implicit solution is:   Although we can't isolate neatly, we can still find the particular constant using the initial condition . Substitute and :   Thus, the particular implicit solution is:      in the Solution   Using separation of variables, solve the differential equation  .

An example of a differential equation that is not separable is . This equation is not separable because the terms involving and are not easily separable onto different sides of the equation. In this case, the method of separation of variables cannot be applied because the terms involving and are not easily separable.     ü§îüí≠ Where Does Separation of Variables Come From?   Explain why you think separation of variables is an appropriate name for the method in this chapter.     The method of separation of variables is named as such because it involves isolating all terms involving to one side and all terms involving to the other. This effectively separates the variables and onto different sides of the equation, allowing for the integration of each side independently. The name \"separation of variables\" reflects the process of isolating the variables onto different sides of the equation.     ü§îüí≠ What Could go Wrong?   Ignoring the fact that the following equation is not separable, suppose we applied the separation of variables process to . What breaks down leading up to the divide & integrate step ?     The next step in the process says to divide both sides by the function of . In our case, this is , so we would get . Now, multiplying both sides by and integrating would yield . The integral on the left side is fine, but the integral on the right side is where the process breaks down since the integral wants to integrate with respect to . Therefore, you are stuck unless you knew as a function of . However, if this were the case, you would have already solved the problem!     ü§îüí≠ Implicit vs. Explicit   Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield explicit solutions, while others yield implicit solutions. Give your interpretation of the difference between an implicit and explicit solution. Provide an example of an implicitly and explicitly defined function.     An implicit solution is one where the relationship between and is not explicitly defined. For example, the solution is an implicit solution. An explicit solution, on the other hand, is one where is defined explicitly as a function of .

  "title": "Completing the Product Rule",
  "body": " Completing the Product Rule   In algebra, a clever rearrangement of terms can make an equation easier to solve. For instance, consider the quadratic:   Factoring the left-hand side gives:   This grouping is helpful because taking the square root immediately reveals the solution.  Some first-order differential equations benefit from a similar idea. Instead of forming a single perfect square, we aim to group the left-hand side as a single derivative .  For example, take the equation:  . It can be rewritten as:  . Just like factoring helped earlier, this new form makes solving easier, only now we integrate instead of take square roots.  We'll call this process completing the product rule . It's based on reversing the product rule from calculus and serves as the foundation of the integrating factor method .    The Product Rule, A Quick Review  Before we reverse the product rule, let's make sure we remember how it works in the forward direction.  In calculus, the product rule tells us how to take the derivative of two multiplied functions. If and are differentiable, then  . To refresh your memory of how it works, try the following practice problems.   üìñ‚ùì Remembering the Product Rule   Compute each of the derivatives below. Assume is a function of .                Use y' for the derivative of in question 2.                  Using the product rule:              The Product Rule in Reverse  Now that we've recalled how the product rule works, let's try running it in reverse.  Suppose you're given the expression:  . Can this be written as the derivative of a product? That is, can you find functions and so that   Here's a tip: the product rule always combines four pieces, two functions and their derivatives. If you can spot and in the terms, the rest should fall into place. In this case, trying and works out perfectly.  Let's get some practice with this reverse thinking.   Basic Reverse Product Rule   Rewrite each expression as a derivative of a product:       First, select an and in different terms, like so   .  For this to work, should be , next to our chosen . However,   So this labeling doesn't work and we instead try the labels   .  Noting that is next to and is next to confirms this is a valid product rule. Therefore, we can reverse the product rule as  .   To make this easier, let's separate the terms as .  So, as before, we first set and   , then verify the derivatives of and are in the other terms,  . Therefore,  .     Let's now try expressions involving a variable function, like . These are the ones we'll actually encounter when solving differential equations.   Reversed Product Rule with a Variable   Rewrite each expression in the form .       Since and are in separate terms, setting to gives you and for free since  . The only thing you need to check is which is sitting right next to . Therefore, we have  .   Again, set to and the rest fall into place as  . The only thing left to do is verify the derivative of : .  So, we can reverse the product rule as  .      üìñ‚ùì What's Missing in the Product Rule   Fill in the missing parts of each product rule below.                                Correct!        Incorrect, try again.          Correct!        Incorrect, try again.          Correct!        Incorrect, expecting to see the independent variable .        Incorrect, use the natural log instead.        Incorrect, try again.          Correct!        Incorrect, don't forget the chain rule.          Correct!        Put in the other blank!        The variable should be a capitol .        Incorrect, try again.          Correct!        Put in the other blank!        Incorrect, try again.        While reversing the product rule isn't a standard technique, practicing it a few times helps build the intuition you'll need when working with integrating factors.     Completing the Product Rule: An Analogy and a Method  Completing the square is a classic strategy from algebra: by adding just the right constant, we can turn a messy quadratic into something easily solvable.  For example, to solve  , we complete the square by adding (since ) to both sides:  , which gives a perfect square:   and from here we solve by taking square roots. Simple and neat.   üìñ‚ùì Purpose of Adding   In the analogy, what role does the number play in the quadratic equation?      The missing piece that allows the quadratic expression to be rewritten as a perfect square.    Correct! The number 9 completes the square, making it factorable.      The solution to the quadratic equation.    Incorrect. The number 9 is introduced to complete the square, not as a solution.      The coefficient of the linear term.    Incorrect. The coefficient of the linear term in the quadratic equation is 6, not 9.      A randomly chosen constant added to balance the equation.    Incorrect. The number 9 is carefully selected to form a perfect square trinomial.      Now let's look at a differential equation that behaves almost exactly the same way:  . The left-hand side looks like it wants to be the result of a product rule. And it could be, if we multiply both sides by :  . That multiplication completes the product rule the same way adding completed the square. Now, the left-hand side is exactly:    üìñ‚ùì Purpose of Multiply   Why do we multiply both sides of by ?      To complete a product rule within this equation.    Correct! Multiplying by allows us to rewrite the left-hand side as a perfect derivative.      To eliminate the derivative term entirely.    Incorrect. The goal is not to eliminate the derivative, but to structure the equation so it can be integrated directly.      To make the right-hand side equal to zero.    Incorrect. The right-hand side is transformed, but it does not become zero.      It makes the equation linear.    Incorrect. The equation already linear. Moreover, multiplying by any function of will not change the equation's linearity.      And just like we took a square root to solve a completed square, here we integrate both sides to solve a completed product rule:   So what's the big idea here? Just as completing the square gives us a clean square to work with, completing the product rule gives us a clean product rule, one we can reverse and integrate.   Completing the Square vs Completing the Product Rule   Here's how the two processes line up:      Completing the Square  Completing the Product Rule   Goal  Solve for  Solve for  Equation     Missing Piece  (added)  (multiplied)    Completed Form      Grouped Form      Solution Step  Take square root  Integrate       This technique, multiplying by the right function to complete the product rule, is the heart of the integrating factor method . And it raises an important question:   How do we know what function to multiply by?   That's what we'll figure out in the next section.      üéß Listen Completing the square transforms a quadratic into a perfect square to make it easier to solve.  A similar idea applies to differential equations: we can complete the product rule by multiplying both sides of the equation by a carefully chosen function.  This multiplication turns the left-hand side into the derivative of a product, making the equation easier to solve through direct integration.  Completing the product rule is conceptually similar to completing the square, both introduce a missing piece that simplifies the structure of the equation.  This technique is the core of the integrating factor method, which is used to solve first-order linear differential equations.  The big question now is: how do we systematically choose the right function to multiply by? That's the focus of the next section.      Answer the following questions:  Recognizing an Incomplete Product Rule   Why do we say the differential equation contains an incomplete product rule?      It lacks a function needed to reverse a product rule.    Correct! The equation is missing an essential function that would allow it to be rewritten using the product rule.      Because we haven't used the product rule yet.    Incorrect. The issue is not that the product rule hasn't been applied, but that the equation is not structured as a product rule.      It has a constant term of .    Incorrect. While the constant term is , the issue is related to the structure of the left-hand side.      It is not in standard form.    Incorrect.

  "title": "The Integrating Factor",
  "body": " The Integrating Factor   In the last section, we explored how rewriting the left-hand side of a differential equation as a single derivative (i.e., completing the product rule ) made it easier to solve. But here's the catch: most equations aren't initially set-up for this.  For example, take the equation   As it is, it's not a complete product rule, but it can be if we multiply both sides by :  . Now, we can reverse product rule on the left, giving us  , which is just one integration away from the solution. The function, , that we multiplied onto the equation is known as the integrating factor . And the natural question is:   Where did come from? Can we always find such a function? How?  This section answers these questions and prepares you for next solution technique, the integrating factor method .    Finding the Right Function to Multiply  To figure out where came from, let's return to our example:   To complete the product rule, we need to multiply the equation by a function. We don't yet know what that function is, so let's call it and multiply both sides of the equation by it:   If completes a product rule on the left, then if should match the form . Setting the labels: , so , and looking for functions and that complete the pattern, we match as follows:  . This suggests that  , and taking the derivative of the first of these means we also have .  Setting the two versions of equal, an interesting equation emerges:  . That's a differential equation. And since it's separable, we know exactly how to solve it:  üìå Note  The absolute value disappears because any sign change is absorbed into the constant .   . When selecting an integrating factor, we are free to choose any nonzero value for . However, we usually choose to keep things simple, so, our integrating factor is:   This is the function we were looking for. It completes the product rule, allowing us to write the left-hand side of the equation as a single derivative and solve by integration.    üìñ‚ùì Integrating Factor Dependence   In the example above, we derived the integrating factor for the equation . Based on this derivation, select the correct ending to the statement:  Of the values in the equation, the integrating factor depends on .       only the value .   Correct! The integrating factor depends only on the coefficient of , which is .     only the value .   Incorrect. The integrating factor does not depend on the constant term , but rather on the coefficient of , which is .     both and .   Incorrect. The integrating factor does not depend on the constant term , but rather only on the coefficient of , which is .     neither nor .   Incorrect. The integrating factor does depend on the coefficient of , which is .       üìñ‚ùì Integrating Factor Equation   To solve the differential equation , you multiply both sides by the integrating factor, , to get Which separable differential equation do you solve to find ?      Correct!     Incorrect     Incorrect. This is not a separable equation.     Incorrect. This equation has too many variables.        A Formula for Any Equation  In the last example, we figured out the integrating factor by treating the left-hand side as a product rule and labeling the parts. Let's now extend that reasoning to any first-order linear differential equation.  We'll start with defining the standard form for these equations:   Standard Form (First-Order, Linear)   A differential equation is said to be in standard form if it can be written as:   where and are known functions of the independent variable , and is the unknown function (dependent variable) we want to find.  Where does the Standard Form come from?   All first-order linear differential equations have a , , and constant term. Therefore, they can be written as . Dividing both sides by the leading coefficient, , and renaming the and constant coefficients as and , gives the standard form .      Our goal is to multiply both sides of a standard-form equation by a function so that the left-hand side becomes the derivative of a product.  Just like before, we assume that multiplying by gives us something that matches the product rule. So we try:   For the left-hand side to be a product rule, we need it to match: .  As before, we set and . Then the rest of the labels follow:   Since , we also know . Setting these equal gives the condition:   This is exactly the same kind of differential equation we solved earlier, just with a general function instead of a constant. It's still separable, and solving it gives us the general formula for the integrating factor:   Just like before, any nonzero constant works, but we typically choose to simplify our computations. This gives us a general formula for the integrating factor:  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Integrating Factor: General Formula  For a first-order linear equation written in standard form the integrating factor is given by .     Try Out the Formula  With the integrating formula in hand, let's practice finding a few with some examples. Remember, the formula assumes the equation is in standard form . Once in this form, it is easy to identify as the coefficient of and apply it to the formula.   Constant Coefficient   Find the integrating factor for     The equation is in standard form and the coefficient of is , so and the integrating factor is:      Logarithmic Result   Find the integrating factor for .    This equation is not in standard form because of in the coefficient of . Dividing through by (since ) puts it in standard form:   Now, we can easily see that . Plugging this into the formula:      Non-Standard Form   Find the integrating factor for .    The variables in this equation are and , so the formula adjusts accordingly: .  Also, this equation is not in standard form, so move the term to the left:  . Then divide through by and note as the coefficient of :   Using , calculate the integral of used in the formula:   To integrate this, we can split the fraction and integrate each term:  üìå Note  Remember, constants of integration are omitted for integrating factors.    Thus, the integrating factor is simplified and given as follows:       üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways   üéß Listen   The integrating factor is the function we multiply onto the entire equation to complete the product rule.

Incorrect. The integrating factor does not depend on , but it does depend on the coefficient of .       Give the Integrating Factor   What is the integrating factor for the equation ?

The method involves three steps:  compute the integrating factor and multiply onto the equation,  this completes the product rule for reversal back into its pre-applied form,  integrate both sides to find the solution .     Multiplying by the integrating factor allows the left-hand side to be written as a single derivative, which can be easily solved by integration.  The process always works on first-order linear equations, regardless of how messy the original equation looks, as long as it can be rewritten in standard form.     "

  "body": " Slope Fields   When working with first-order differential equations, you can gain insight into solutions without fully solving them. By focusing on how the solutions change, you can use a slope field to visualize the path of any potential solution.  A slope field visually represents the slopes that a solution curve must follow at each point in the plane, shown as short arrows pointing the way a solution would travel‚Äîlike a leaf carried by a stream.  The pattern created by a slope field provides a visual representation of the family of solutions to the differential equation. A slope field doesn't show just one solution‚Äîit shows them all. From any starting point, a unique curve threads through, always guided by the tiny arrows.   From Equation to Slope  Every first-order differential equation combines , , and . By rearranging terms, we can always write it as: where collects all terms. For example:   When it is possible to isolate , we write:   Here is the slope generator : give it any point and it outputs the slope the solution must have there.

Draw a short line segment at the point with that slope.   For example, take Computing nine slopes on a grid yields:                     Sketching by hand is great for intuition but tedious when you need more points. Computer-generated slope fields fill in the gaps, revealing a dense web of arrows that paints the full picture. In , the solution curve through flows smoothly along the arrows, like an object carried by a current.       Slope field for    A slope field turns an equation into a navigational chart. Each arrow is an instruction every solution must obey.

That pattern shows up in their slope fields as horizontal stripes of identical slope behavior. Now we'll focus on one especially important feature of those fields: the horizontal lines where the slope is zero. Along those lines, the system simply stops changing. These constant solutions are called equilibrium solutions .    Flat Lines and Fixed Behavior  Consider the slope field for the autonomous equation:  . Since this is autonomous, the slope depends only on . At certain -values, something special happens: the slope becomes exactly zero.       Slope field for    In the slope field, those points appear as rows of perfectly horizontal segments . That's no accident‚Äîwhere , the solution curve doesn't move. If a solution starts there, it stays there forever. These flat lines are the equilibrium solutions .  To find them, we set (the slope) to zero and solve for . In this example: So the equilibrium solutions are the constant functions and .  These constant solutions act like anchors in the system: other solutions either drift toward them or get pushed away.

But not all equilibrium solutions are alike, some attract nearby solutions, others repel them, and some do a bit of both. In this section, we'll learn how to classify these points by examining the slope field, the sign of , and a tool called a phase line .    Types of Equilibria  Suppose is an equilibrium solution of an autonomous equation . If you nudge a solution slightly above or below , it might drift back, move away, or react differently on each side. What it does determines the type of equilibrium it is.  There are three common types:   Stable (sink): Solutions move toward the equilibrium from both sides.  Unstable (source): Solutions move away from the equilibrium on both sides.  Semi-stable (node): Solutions move toward the equilibrium on one side and away from it on the other.   In a slope field, a sink looks like arrows converging toward a horizontal line, a source shows arrows diverging away, and a node is a mix: converging on one side, diverging on the other. Next, we'll look at different ways to determine these behaviors.    Classification via the Phase Line  Slope fields show a lot of information at once, but for autonomous equations we can simplify. Since the slope depends only on , we can compress the slope field into a simple vertical diagram of just -values. This is called a phase line .  On a phase line:   Equilibria are marked with solid dots.  Regions where get upward arrows.  Regions where get downward arrows.   The arrows summarize how changes: whether solutions are rising or falling. Follow the arrows up or down and you'll see where solutions eventually settle‚Äîor whether they're pushed away.

Notice in that the sign of flips as you pass through an equilibrium. The pattern of that flip tells you what kind of point it is:   At the source , , goes from negative ‚Üí positive (increases).  At the sink , , goes from positive ‚Üí negative (decreases).   The important observation is that increases through sources and decreases through sinks. This is true in general, so we can classify equilibrium solutions by looking at the sign of at the equilibrium points.                 If , then is an equilibrium. To classify it:   If , it's a sink (stable).  If , it's a source (unstable).  If , the test is inconclusive‚Äîyou'll need more investigation.

  "title": "Parameter Analysis",
  "body": " Parameter Analysis      Many mathematical models include one or more parameters ‚Äîconstants that represent things like birth rates, drug dosage, resource limits, or physical constants. These parameters aren't just placeholders‚Äîthey often control the qualitative behavior of the system. Small changes in a parameter's value can cause major shifts in the solution's behavior. Understanding those changes is the goal of parameter analysis .  In this section, we focus on the most important modeling insight: how equilibria and their stability depend on parameters . When a parameter crosses a critical threshold, the model's behavior can shift dramatically‚Äîthis is called a bifurcation .    Bifurcation Analysis  A bifurcation is a qualitative change in the system's dynamics caused by varying a parameter. In the context of differential equations, it usually means that the number or stability of equilibrium solutions changes at certain critical values.  Consider the one-parameter system: where is a parameter. As changes:   Existing equilibria may change from stable to unstable (or vice versa).  New equilibria may appear or disappear altogether.  In some cases, the long-term behavior of the entire system changes.   The basic workflow for bifurcation analysis is:   Find equilibria: Solve for in terms of the parameter .  Classify stability: Compute at each equilibrium. The sign determines whether the equilibrium is a sink (stable) or a source (unstable).  Track changes: See how the equilibria and their stability change as varies. Identify critical values where the behavior flips.   Consider the parameterized system: .  First, we find the equilibria: .  To see how the equilibria depend on , solve for equilibrium:  For : two equilibria exist ( ).  For : a single equilibrium ( ).  For : no real equilibria.    Stability analysis shows that one branch is stable and the other is unstable when . The bifurcation diagram reveals a collision of equilibria at , called a saddle-node bifurcation .  The results are often summarized in a bifurcation diagram ‚Äîa picture showing:  The equilibria plotted against .  Solid lines for stable equilibria, dashed lines for unstable ones.  Critical parameter values where the diagram changes shape.     shows the bifurcation diagram for the previous example.   Bifurcation diagram for      Bifurcation diagrams are a cornerstone of modeling‚Äîthey show, at a glance, how a system's behavior shifts as conditions change.    Why Parameter Analysis Matters in Modeling  Why should we care about bifurcations? Because in applied problems, parameters represent real things : a harvest rate in an ecology model, a dosage in a drug model, or an investment threshold in an economics model. Changing those parameters changes the system.  The most important modeling insight:   Stable equilibria correspond to long-term states the system will settle into.  Bifurcation points are thresholds where those long-term states shift‚Äîsuddenly and sometimes irreversibly.

  "body": " Logistical Models       The Logistic Model  One of the most famous autonomous differential equations is the logistic model , which describes population growth when there are limited resources. The equation is:   where is the population at time , is the growth rate, and is the carrying capacity , the maximum population that the environment can sustain.  This equation has two equilibrium points:   (extinction),  (population stabilizes at carrying capacity).   The phase line for this model shows:   At , the equilibrium is unstable, any small population increase leads to growth.  At , the equilibrium is stable, populations near this value settle toward it.  When , populations increase.  When , populations decrease.   This model captures how populations grow rapidly when small, slow down as they approach the carrying capacity, and eventually level off.   Logistic Model Analysis   Consider the logistic equation .  Identify the equilibrium points.  Sketch the phase line and classify the stability of each equilibrium.  Explain how this model describes long-term population behavior.      The equilibrium points are and .  On the phase line:   is a source (unstable).  is a sink (stable).   Populations grow when between and , and shrink when above . The model predicts eventual stabilization at the carrying capacity.    The logistic model is sometimes written in a slightly different form:   where is the carrying capacity and is the growth-rate constant. This form emphasizes that growth is proportional to both the current population and the remaining resource capacity .  This is still a first-order autonomous differential equation, but unlike the exponential model, it is nonlinear since the right-hand side is not a linear function of .  The analysis is the same: the equilibria are and . The phase line tells us their stability, just like before.   A Modified Logistic Model  Let's now consider a variation on the logistic model that includes an important ecological detail, what happens to very small populations. The standard logistic model assumes that populations always grow when small, but in reality, sparse populations can have difficulty finding mates, making growth negative at low levels.  As an example, consider pine squirrels in the Rocky Mountains. These animals are territorial, and both overcrowding and underpopulation can limit their growth:   If the population is too large , territorial conflict slows growth or even causes decline.  If the population is too small , individuals may not find mates, also resulting in decline.  If the population is exactly zero, it stays at zero forever.   Let's model this situation. We define:   = time,  = squirrel population at time ,  = growth-rate coefficient,  = carrying capacity (too large),  = sparsity threshold (too small).   We want the growth rate to satisfy the following:   if or ,  if ,  .   A function with this behavior might look like:   This is the modified logistic model . It adjusts the standard model to account for low-population risks.  Let's analyze it. The equilibrium points occur where the right-hand side equals zero:   (extinction),  (sparsity threshold),  (carrying capacity).   The phase line tells us:   is a stable equilibrium (a sink).  is an unstable equilibrium (a source).  is a stable equilibrium (a sink).   This model better captures real-world behavior by showing that small populations might go extinct if they fall below the sparsity threshold.   Modified Logistic Model Analysis  Consider the differential equation:   Find all equilibrium solutions.  Sketch the phase line and label the stability of each equilibrium.  Explain how this model improves on the standard logistic model.     Equilibrium points: , , .  Phase line summary:   is a sink (stable).  is a source (unstable).  is a sink (stable).   Between and , populations decrease. Between and , populations increase. Above , populations decrease. This reflects the idea that populations only grow when they're within a safe range, not too small and not too large.      üì§ Wrap-Up    üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..

This kind of solution is called an analytic solution , or sometimes a closed-form solution . It is valuable because it expresses as a formula-like structure that you can plug in any value of and instantly get the exact -value.  However, many differential equations, such as   simply don't have a tidy closed-form solution. In those cases, we switch tools. Instead of searching for an exact formula, we use a numerical method . A numerical method doesn't hand you as a formula‚Äîit builds an approximation , one step at a time, starting from what you know and using the differential equation to predict what happens next.

Euler's method, as we will see, is the entry point into this expansive field of computational mathematics, demonstrating how straightforward concepts can approximate solutions to complex problems.    Iterative Methods‚ÄîThinking in Steps  Most numerical methods are iterative , which means they don't try to solve the whole problem at once. Instead, they repeat the same small task again and again.  That task is simple: use the information you already have to generate new information. Do it once, you get the next step. Do it a hundred times, you build a whole solution.  So, the key to understanding an iterative method is by learning its task.   üìñ‚ùì What does iterative mean?   Euler's method (and most numerical methods) are described as iterative . What does that mean in practice?     It repeats a single simple step many times to build up a solution.  Correct ‚Äî iterative methods loop the same calculation to generate new information.    It always produces the exact solution in one step.  No ‚Äî that's the opposite of iterative thinking. Iteration builds up an approximate solution step by step.    It skips steps and jumps straight to the final answer.  No ‚Äî iterative methods never skip. They accumulate results step by step.    It uses only algebra, not calculus, to solve equations.  Not quite ‚Äî Euler's method uses the slope from calculus, but applies it in a repetitive way.       Euler's Method Task  For Euler's method, the repeated task can be summed up like this:   from a known point, move to a nearby point along the direction of the slope.   Think of following a hiking trail using only a compass‚Äîyou don't know exactly where the trail ends, but if you keep stepping in the right direction, you'll trace the path. In Euler's method, that direction is the slope from the differential equation.  More precisely, if is a point on the solution and you know the slope there, you can predict where the next point will be.  To understand this one step, we'll answer two guiding questions:   What does it mean to move in the direction of a slope?  Given a point, slope, and step size, what is the formula for the next point?     Moving in the Direction of a Slope  First question: What does it mean to move in the direction of a slope? Suppose you're at the point and the slope there is .  Slope is rise over run : for every unit you move horizontally ( run ), you move a certain amount vertically ( rise ). From , a slope of means that for every 2 units of run, you rise 3 units, like so: .  So moving from in a direction with slope , lands you at . See .   Rise Clarification   Rise doesn't always mean up ‚Äîif the slope is negative, rise is actually a fall. We'll keep calling it rise for simplicity, but remember it might point downward.   Of course, there's nothing special about using a run of 2. We could have used (rise would then be 6) or even (rise would be ). All of the following fractions   describe the same slope, which can be visualized in .  In Euler's method, we intentionally choose a small run called the step size, . Therefore, for a small run, , you get the corresponding rise by:   So given a direction (slope) to move and the step size ( ) to take, this formula gives you the rise. Next, we'll see how this simple relationship is the core of Euler's one-step move.    Same Slope, Different Rise and Runs    Rise , run       Rise , run       Rise , run          üìñ‚ùì Calculating the Rise   Suppose the slope at a point is and you take a step size of . What is the rise over that step?      Yes ‚Äî rise = slope √ó step size = .     That's the slope itself, not the rise for the small step.     That's the step size (run), not the rise.     Double-check the multiplication ‚Äî slope √ó step size is much smaller.       The Movement Rule  Now that we've decided how to take a step, we can write it as a formula.  From basic geometry, a new point is just the old point plus the changes:  . Euler's method sets the run to the step size and the rise to . Substituting those gives the update rule:  . This single equation captures the whole one-step task: start at the current point, find the slope, take a step of size in that direction, and you land at the next point. Euler's method is simply this step repeated many times.   üìñ‚ùì Understanding the Movement Formula   What does the term represent in Euler's movement rule?     The change in over the chosen step.  Correct ‚Äî the slope tells the direction, and scales it into a small rise.    The next value.  No ‚Äî the update is handled separately as .    The slope of the entire solution curve.  Careful ‚Äî this is the slope at a single point, not the whole curve.    The error made by Euler's method in each step.  Not true ‚Äî is the predicted rise, not the error.       üì§ Wrap-Up    üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..   Numerical methods like Euler's are iterative: they repeat one simple step to build a full solution.  Euler's one-step task is move from where you are in the direction of the slope.  Choosing a step size sets the run, and the rise is just .  Euler's method is based on the movement rule .     Check Your Understanding   üìñ‚ùì Big Picture of Euler's Step   Which statement best describes what Euler's method does one step at a time ?     From a current point, it uses the slope to predict the next point.  Correct ‚Äî Euler's method is nothing more than this step, done over and over.    It finds one term of the exact general solution.  No ‚Äî finding terms of the solution would be an analytic method.    It moves to a nearby point on the solution curve.  No ‚Äî if you knew where the solution curve was, you would already have the solution to the equation.    It approximates the roots of the characteristic equation.

  "title": "Euler‚Äôs Method: The Full Process",
  "body": " Euler's Method: The Full Process   In the previous section, we zoomed in on the single step at the heart of Euler's method: move forward by a small amount in , and adjust by times the slope. Now we'll zoom out. By repeating that step again and again, we can march across an interval, building an approximate solution point by point.    A Concrete Step Through Euler's Method  Before writing any formulas, it helps to see what Euler's Method feels like. Think of Euler's method like crossing a landscape with only a compass. You know where you start. At each step, you check your direction (the slope from the differential equation), take a small stride that way, then check again. That back-and-forth of step, check, adjust is the rhythm of the method.   The Goal  Suppose we have the initial value problem . Let's approximate the solution at the equally-spaced -values: . This tells us that our goal is to approximate the -values at the following points:  . Luckily, the first value is just the initial condition, , so we add it to the list: . Starting at , Euler's method finds the rest of the points, one-by-one.    Approximating the Next Point  From , we need to get to . Clearly, the run is , but we also need the slope for our movement direction. This comes directly from the differential equation: .  Moving from with a slope of and a run of is given by: .  Therefore, the next point is and our approximation list becomes: .    Approximating the Rest of the Points  To get the third and fourth point, we just repeat what we just did.  At , we get the slope from: .  Using this slope and the same run, we get the third point: .  Now we are at and the slope we move this time is: .  and our final point is given by: .  With this, our approximation is now complete: .  A plot of the process is given in .   (left) Euler's method approximation of the solution to with step size . (right) Plot of each point in the approximation.         (approx)                                        Euler's Method  Now let's generalize the concrete example. As we do, check the footnotes for the concrete version of each equation and step.  Consider an initial value problem:  .  We divide into equally spaced values (a distance apart):      Using the shorthand , our goal is to approximate the points:      The first point, , is known since it is the initial condition. The remaining points are approximated using the movement rule , where cur is and new is :  . The slope is found from in the differential equation, so the rule becomes:   Extracting just the -coordinate, gives the update rule for Euler's method:   That's it. All of the values in the table of can be found with this formula.   Match Euler's Method Parts to their Meaning   Assume the current approximation using Euler's Method is denoted by . In this context, match the mathematical expression with its meaning.    These pairings are essential when converting a piecewise function into unit step form. The form you choose depends entirely on where each piece is active.      The value of the next approximation.     The value of the previous approximation.     The distance between and .     The slope of the solution at the current approximation.     The value of the current approximation.     The rise (or fall) in the value from the current approximation to the next approximation.      Euler's Method  Given an initial value problem   approximate the solution with the following steps:   Select step size  Choosing a step size determines where for .   Apply Euler's update rule  For to , compute      Desipte being based on relatively simple idea, Euler's method reveals something profound: with nothing more than a starting point and slope formula, you can approximate a solution that no closed-form equation could describe.    Examples   Euler's Method Example   Use Euler's method to approximate the solution to the differential equation over the interval with a step size of .     . The step size is , so the approximation locations are .   . The initial condition gives the first value in our approximation, .  Now, we can use the formula to find , and as follows:            The simplified calculations are summarized in the following table:                                Thus, the approximate solution to the initial-value problem is   We can visualize the approximation by plotting the points and connecting them with line segments. The exact solution to the initial-value problem is given by   The following plot shows the approximation and the exact solution.     The red curve is the exact solution, while the green points are the approximated values at . The blue line segments connect the points in the approximation, showing how Euler's method steps through the solution.  The following plot shows the approximation and the exact solution, with a grid for better visualization.                Analytical and Numerical Solutions   Consider the differential equation .   Find the analytical solution to this equation using the method of separation of variables.    Use Euler's method with a step size of to approximate the solution at .    Compare the analytical solution with the numerical approximation obtained from Euler's method.       To solve the differential equation using the method of separation of variables, we separate the variables as follows: Integrating both sides gives: Exponentiating both sides results in: Since the initial condition, , gives , the analytical solution is:   Next, we apply Euler's method to approximate the solution at . The general formula for Euler's method is: where and . So, we can update the formula as:   For , we contruct the following table:                                            Since , the approximation we are looking for is .  Comparing this with the analytical solution at , we see the true value is: Although there is some error between the two values, it is more due to the step size we chose, rather than the method itself. A smaller step size would yield a more accurate approximation. For example, using gives the approximation: .     Example: Euler's Method with   Use Euler's method to approximate the solution to over to using step size .

  "title": "The LHCC Equation",
  "body": " The LHCC Equation   Before learning how to solve Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) differential equations, it's important to identify these equations and understand the nature of their structure. In this section, we'll define what it means for a differential equation to be homogeneous, review how constant coefficients affect the form of the equation, and formally define what qualifies as an LHCC equation.    Linear Differential Equations & Forcing Functions  Recall that a differential equation is called linear if it only contains linear terms, meaning the dependent variable and its derivatives appear to the first power without multiplication or composed with one another.  An equation is nonlinear nonlinear if it includes terms like , , , or , where the dependent variable is raised to a power or multiplied by one of its derivatives.  A general -th order linear differential equation looks like this:   The coefficients and the right-hand side depend only on the independent variable, which we're calling . While we previously referred to as a constant term, in this context, it is known as the forcing function .  Forcing functions are not always easily identifiable on the right-hand side of a differential equation. Sometimes, terms and their derivatives may be mixed in, or parts of the forcing function may appear on the left.  For example, the equation the forcing function is not immediately clear. Rearranging it into standard form: reveals that the forcing function is .   üìñ‚ùì Identifying the Forcing Function   What is the forcing function in the differential equation?       Correct! The forcing function is the entire right-hand side of the equation.  `   This is the coefficient of the term, not the forcing function.     This is only part of the forcing function.     This is only part of the forcing function.       Constant Coefficients  A linear differential equation has constant coefficients if all the coefficients are constants rather than functions of the independent variable .  So, a linear differential equation with constant coefficients looks like:  . Here are a few examples of linear equations with constant coefficients:  , And here are some that do not have constant coefficients:  .  üìñ‚ùì Identifying Constant Coefficient Equations   Select all the linear differential equations that have constant coefficients.           Correct! All coefficients are constant.           Incorrect. The coefficient of is , which is not constant.           Correct! All coefficients are constant.           Incorrect. The coefficient is not a constant.        Homogeneous  A linear differential equation is homogeneous if the right-hand side is zero‚Äîthat is, there is no forcing term. Otherwise, it is nonhomogeneous .  For example, the following equations are homogeneous:   These are nonhomogeneous because of the (boxed) right-hand side:    üìñ‚ùì Identifying Homogeneous Equations   Which of the following equations is homogeneous?         Correct! The right-hand side is zero, so the equation is homogeneous.         Incorrect. This equation looks homogeneous, but homogeneity only applies to linear equations.         Incorrect. The equation has a non-zero constant term, making it non-homogeneous.         Incorrect. The right-hand side has a non-zero function of , so this is non-homogeneous.        The LHCC Equation  Putting it all together, we arrive at the definition of an LHCC equation.    A linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients (LHCC) has the form:   where all coefficients are constants.    The following equations are examples of LHCC equations:  .    The forcing function is the collection of all terms that are not multiplied by the dependent variable, typically written on the right-side.  An equation has constant coefficients when all the coefficients multiplying and its derivatives are fixed constants (not functions of ).  A differential equation is homogeneous if the forcing function is zero.  An equation is a inear omogeneous onstant oefficient equation.     üìñ‚ùì Matching Equations with Properties   Match each differential equation to its correct classification.    Good work! Recognizing equation types helps determine the best solution method.

  "title": "Exponential Solutions",
  "body": " Exponential Solutions   Now that we can identify LHCC equations, it's time to ask a deeper question: what kinds of functions satisfy these equations? As it turns out, exponential functions are not just one possible answer, they are the natural solution.  In this section, we'll explore what makes exponentials so special. You'll see why other functions fail to work, why exponentials succeed, and how this leads us to a powerful tool called the characteristic equation .

Incorrect. & ARE NOT like terms and cannot be combined by addition.     Incorrect. & ARE NOT like terms and cannot be combined by addition.        Motivating the Exponential Solution  Consider the simple linear homogeneous constant coefficient differential equation: .  For the moment, forget that it is a differential equation and imagine that it is just two functions that simplify to zero after subtraction. That is, they cancelled out with each other. Algebra tells you that only like-terms simplify via subtraction. For example, since all three are like-terms. However, does not simplify at all since none are like-terms.   Logically, if is the solution, then this equation says and must be like-terms since they subtract to zero. This leads to the next big question:   What function is a like-term with its derivative?   You may recall from calculus that the derivative of an exponential function is another exponential function. For example, if , then , which are like-terms. This unique property makes exponentials ideal candidates for solutions.  To illustrate this, let's substitute different functions into a first-order LHCC equation and see which ones cancel.    Case 1:       Case 2:       Case 3:      Only the exponential function produces like-terms that cancel perfectly. Again, suggesting that exponential functions are ideal solutions to LHCC equations.   üìñ‚ùì Valid Function Choices   Consider the differential equation, where is a constant.  Logically explain why it is impossible for to be a solution to this equation no matter what value takes.      Multiple Exponential Solutions   Verify that and are solutions to the differential equation   but that , , and are not.    First, let's check the first two exponential functions:                  As you can see, the exponential functions produce like-terms that cancel out and simplify to zero.  Let's see what happens when we plug in non-exponential functions:                  In this case, the non-exponential functions produce non-like-terms that cannot be simplified and are not solutions.  Finally, let's check the exponential function, :          In this case, we get like-terms, but the coefficients do not sum to zero and the terms do not cancel. Therefore, is not a solution.    These examples show that exponentials are the only functions that reliably cancel out to yield zero when substituted into an LHCC equation. Even among exponentials, only those with specific exponents will satisfy a given equation. Next, we'll introduce the characteristic equation, an algebraic tool that helps us identify exactly which exponential functions will work.    The Characteristic Equation   We now know that exponential functions are strong candidates for solutions to LHCC equations. But how do we find the values of that work? The answer lies in forming a polynomial equation called the characteristic equation .   Let's try this with a few concrete examples. First, suppose  . Substituting gives   Since , the equation reduces to   This algebraic equation, , is the characteristic equation . It tells us that is a solution.  For second-order equations, we follow the same substitution process. For example, for   we substitute into , , and , resulting in   Setting the polynomial equal to zero gives the characteristic equation:   Solving this gives   so the general solution is    üìñ‚ùì Match the Characteristic Equation   Match each characteristic equation to its differential equation.                             Characteristic Equation & Exponential Solutions   For each of the following equations, determine the characteristic equation and the exponential solutions that satisfy it.     1.

These equations have the general form:   where , , and are constants. In this section, we'll explore how the solutions depend on the roots of the associated characteristic equation, and how different types of roots give rise to different forms of the general solution.   üìñ‚ùì Classifying Characteristic Equations   Review quadratic equations and answer the following question.  Match the type of roots with the corresponding quadratic equation.    Good work! The discriminant helps classify root types.

For this case, the characteristic equation is the quadratic    Solving this equation using the quadratic formula yields:   Each root corresponds to an exponential solution‚Äîeither or . These are called the fundamental solutions of the differential equation.    The General Solution  Once we have the fundamental solutions, the superposition principle tells us that   is a solution to for any constants and .  However, if the roots and are equal, then and are like-terms. In that case, the expression above collapses into a single term, and the solution is incomplete. This issue relates to linear dependence , which also depends on the interval where the solutions are defined.   To create a second, independent solution, we multiply the second term by , giving:   This guarantees complete general solution with independent terms. There are three distinct scenarios to consider, based on the discriminant of the characteristic equation:   Each case leads to a different form of the solution, broken down as follows.    Case 1 : Real, Non-Repeating Solutions  If is positive, then characteristic equation has the two unequal real solutions:  , so the general solution is  .

  "body": " Higher-Order Equations   Like second-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations, we solve higher-order equations by finding the roots of a characteristic equation. However, with higher-order comes higher-degree characteristic polynomials and an increased number of roots.

  "title": "Solving High-Order LHCC Equations",
  "body": "Solving High-Order LHCC Equations   As the previous section demonstrated, constructing the general solution of a LHCC equation is fairly straightforward given the roots of the characteristic equation. However, solving high-degree polynomial equations can be quite challenging. While there are strategies to tackle this by hand, sometimes computational tools are necessary to obtain the solutions. Below, we will outline some common approaches    Factoring  Some high-degree characteristic polynomials can be factored by hand using classic algebraic techniques. Factoring is the fastest way to solve these problems when it works. We'll start by reviewing common methods of factoring and apply them to characteristic equations that appear in LHCC differential equations.  Here are a few algebraic strategies you may find helpful:  üßÆ Factoring Techniques                                Let's now apply these tools to solve higher-order LHCC equations by factoring their characteristic equations.   Solving LHCC Equations by Factoring the Characteristic Equation   These examples show how to find the general solution to higher-order LHCC equations using a variety of factoring techniques to find the roots of the characteristic equation.   1.     The characteristic equation is:   Applying the difference of squares:       2.    The characteristic equation is:   Factoring out the common term , followed by a differences of squares gives:         3.     This factors as a difference of squares twice:         4.    The characteristic equation is:   Use the substitution, , to reveal a quadratic in disguise:   Reverse the substitution, , back into :         5.    The characteristic equation is:   Take out and use standard factoring:         6.    The characteristic equation is:   We can factor this by grouping and recognizing a sum of cubes:            Rational Root Theorem  When the characteristic polynomial is hard to factor by inspection, the Rational Root Theorem provides a systematic way to search for rational (fractional) solutions. Once you find a root, you can use polynomial division to reduce the polynomial to a lower degree. From there, you can repeat the process or apply other factoring techniques.  While this method is reliable, it can be tedious by hand and prone to errors. That's why technology often comes in handy.    Using Technology: Factoring High-Degree Polynomials  Not all characteristic polynomials can be factored easily ‚Äî and some can't be factored at all using simple algebra. In these cases, it's perfectly reasonable to turn to technology.  Computer algebra systems (CAS), online factoring tools, and symbolic solvers can quickly find the roots of even complicated polynomials. Once you have the roots, you can build the general solution using the framework you learned earlier.  For example, suppose you want to solve the following LHCC equation:  . The first step is to write down the characteristic equation:   This is challenging to solve by hand, but we can use the tool below to factor it.  Type 2*r^4 + 9*r^3 + r^2 - 21*r + 9 into the text box and press enter.   Polynomial Factoring Calculator Directions   Directions:  Enter a polynomial in the box below.  Use r for the variable, * for multiplication, and ^ for exponents.  Press enter to see the factored form and approximate values.  Note: It only factors polynomials with fractional (rational) roots.       After entering the polynomial, you should see the factored form:   From here the roots are easily identified as:   Therefore, the general solution is:    üìñ‚ùì Solving a High-Order LHCC Equation With a Factoring Tool   Find the general solution to the LHCC equation by using the factoring tool to find the characteristic roots.      Characteristic Roots:   General Solution:   Use c1 , c2 , c3 as the arbitrary constants of integration.                  First, write down the characteristic equation: . Plugging this into to the factoring tool shows that it factors as . Solving for , we get . Therefore, the general solution is: .       Using Technology: Approximating Roots  Some characteristic equations are too messy to factor, even with software. When this happens, a numerical root finder can provide decimal approximations of the roots, allowing us to write down the structure of the general solution.  Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:   The characteristic equation is: This polynomial has no obvious factoring pattern, and standard techniques fail. Fortunately, numerical approximation tools can help.  Try entering r^5 - 4*r^3 + 3*r^2 - 1 into the same factoring tool above. You should get the following approximations for three real roots:   and the complex pair:   using the standard root-to-solution rules, the general solution is:    üìñ‚ùì Decimal Roots in the General Solution   Suppose you find the characteristic roots are approximately .  Which of the following best describes the general solution?        Correct! The real root gives a standalone exponential, and the complex pair contributes an oscillatory term with the same .       Incorrect. The sine and cosine must be multiplied by .       Incorrect. This would be appropriate if were a triple root.       This mixes formats and includes a non-real exponential.      Regardless of the method you choose to find the roots, the general solution is relatively easy to construct once you have them.    If the characteristic polynomial factors easily, use algebraic techniques like grouping, factoring by common terms, or recognizing patterns such as difference of squares or cubes.  When factoring is hard or impossible by hand, use a factoring tool or numerical solver to find the roots.  Once the roots are known, constructing the full general solution is mechanical and follows a predictable structure.    "

  "title": "The LNCC Equation",
  "body": " The LNCC Equation   You already know that a linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equation has the form:   All the terms are on the left, and the right-hand side is zero. This equation is called homogeneous because the solution only includes terms that cancel each other out.  A linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation looks almost the same, except the right-hand side is now a function:   The function is called the forcing function because it introduces an external input that forces the system to respond in a particular way.   üìñ‚ùì Homogeneous vs Nonhomogeneous   Which structure or property of a differential equation separates homogeneous from nonhomogeneous equations?      The presence of a non-zero forcing function.    Correct! A non-zero constant term on the right-hand side of the equation indicates a nonhomogeneous equation.      The dependent variable.    Incorrect. The dependent variable is present in both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations.      The order of the equation.    Incorrect. Both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations can have the same order.      The linearity of the equation.    Incorrect. Both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous equations can be linear.        Guessing a Solution that Accounts for the Forcing Function   Note: For brevity, we will refer to the left side of equation as üçÑ. Also, when we say plug into üçÑ , we mean calculate and substitute , , into , then simplify.   Imagine you had to make your best guess as to which function, , satisfies the equation  . Remember, after differentiating your guess and plugging it into üçÑ, all terms must simplify to . That is,  . Logically, for the sum of three terms to simplify to , they must share a similar structure as (i.e., a degree polynomial). or contain terms that completely cancel out, but we will ignore these for now.    üìñ‚ùì Select the most appropriate solution   Based on this logic, which function is the only possible candidate for the solution to the LNCC equation?  .  Hint: Think about the type of functions you need to add together to get .            Incorrect. This function does not resemble the forcing function.           Incorrect. Plugging into will not give you an term you need to match the forcing function, .           Correct! This 3rd degree polynomial has the same polynomial structure as the forcing function, .           Incorrect. Plugging into will leave you with an term that does not exist in the forcing function, .      In this context, a similar function-type to means our guess should also be a degree polynomial. Since we don't know which one, we use the general degree form:   Plugging this into üçÑ and taking some derivatives, we get   This is not , but maybe we can find and values that get us there. Setting the expression equal to , we have   Matching the and , gives us the system:   Substituting and into completes the solution:     Confirming our Guess  Let's double-check that the function, , we found really satisfies the equation.   This confirms as a solution. In fact, it is the most important solution because it accounts for the specific forcing function and must be included in every solution to equation . Such solutions are called particular solutions , but they are only part of the whole story.    The Hidden Parts of Nonhomogeneous Solutions  We established that the particular solution, , is what you plug into üçÑ to get . However, there could be additional terms you can plug into üçÑ that cancel out after taking derivatives and simplifying. Specifically,   We already know how to find these functions since they are just the solutions to the homogeneous version of the same equation:   This LHCC equation is solved using its characteristic equation:   This homogeneous solution, we'll call , is given by   and is the other half of LNCC solution. They provide the terms that cancel out when plugged into üçÑ and have no impact on the forcing function at all.    Combining the Parts Into a General Solution  To summarize, the general solution of equation consists of two parts:  The homogeneous part: (canceling terms), and  The particular part: (account for )  and we write it as the sum of these parts:  . Finally, let's see how the different parts of the general solution behave when plugged into the left side of the equation. First, let's plug in    and regroup the and terms:   Now, we will now show that the homogeneous terms, 1Ô∏è‚É£, simplify to zero:  Next, we will show that the particular terms, 2Ô∏è‚É£, simplify to :   So, adding the results of 1Ô∏è‚É£ and 2Ô∏è‚É£, leaves us with the forcing function, .     The General Solution to LNCC Equations  Let's summarize what we've learned so far:   ‚ú≥Ô∏è LNCC General Solution Structure   A linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation has the form:   Its general solution is built from two parts:      is the solution to the corresponding homogeneous (LHCC) equation:    the particular solution that produces the forcing function .      üìñ‚ùì Contructing the General Solution   Suppose the homogeneous and particular solutions of an LNCC equation are given by . Select the general solution for such an equation.       .    Incorrect. This is only the particular solution, not the complete general solution.       .    Incorrect. One of the terms in this expression is incorrect.       .    Correct! The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions.       .    Incorrect. You do not multiply the particular solution by a constant.      Here's a quick example to help solidify this concept.  Finding the general solution, given    Find the general solution to the differential equation given that the particular solution is known to be .     The general solution has the form:   Since is given, we only need to solve the homogeneous equation:   Using the characteristic equation:   The homogeneous solution is:   Therefore, the general solution is:     While the structure of LNCC solutions is now clear, actually determining requires a systematic approach. The next section introduces the Method of Undetermined Coefficients, a technique for efficiently constructing when has a specific form.     A linear differential equation is nonhomogeneous if the right-hand side is not zero‚Äîit includes a forcing function , .  You can often guess a particular solution that matches the structural forms of the forcing function.  The general solution is .      Answer the following questions related to LNCC equations and their solutions.   Role of the Particular Solution   Which statement best describes the role of the particular solution to an LNCC equation?      Part of the general solution that accounts for the forcing function.    Correct! The particular solution is chosen to match the form of and account for its influence in the equation.      General solution of the LNCC equation.    Incorrect. The general solution of the homogeneous equation is called the complementary solution, not the particular solution.      Roots of the characteristic equation.    Incorrect. The characteristic equation is related to the complementary solution and does not involve the particular solution.      Coefficients of the differential equation.    Incorrect. The particular solution addresses the specific form of and is part of solving the non-homogeneous equation, but its purpose isn't simplification.

  "title": "Selecting the Particular Solution Form",
  "body": " Selecting the Particular Solution Form   In the previous section, we saw that the general solution to a linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient (LNCC) equation has two parts: the homogeneous solution  and the particular solution  . The homogeneous solution is found using the characteristic equation, while the particular solution is constructed by (1) selecting a form similar to the forcing function, , and (2) determining the coefficients of that form.  In this section, we focus on selecting a form for . The key idea is to match the structural form of the forcing function , so that when it is substituted into the differential equation, all the resulting terms simplify to .    Selecting Basic Forms  The first step in choosing is recognizing the structure of . Since and its derivatives must eventually simplify to match , should have a similar form. If is a polynomial, exponential, sine, or cosine function, then should be too.   provides a guide for selecting an initial form of based on the type of . In each case, represent the undetermined coefficients we'll solve for later.    forms based on , where are known constants. must be determined. Degree 4+ polynomials follow a similar pattern.        Forcing Function Type,  Particular Solution Form,    1  (constant)     2      3      4      5      6       One important note: even if a term is missing in , you should still include it in if it's part of the general form. For example:   üî∏  If , the term is missing, but must still include it: .    üî∏  If , then . Even though isn't in , it's needed because its derivative produces cosine terms.    Selecting Basic Forms of   Use to determine the appropriate form of in each case.      Since is exponential, we use : .         This matches . Even though doesn't appear in , we include it: .          is a degree 2 polynomial, so from : .         Move the constant to the right side: . Now is constant ( ): .         4th degree polynomials are not represented in the table, but follow a similar pattern: .        üìñ‚ùì Matching single term forcing functions to the particular form   Drag each forcing function on the left to the initial selection of on the right.                                                When Guessing Works (and When It Doesn't)  This method of guessing the particular solution based on the forcing function is very effective. However, it does have its limitations. In particular, it only applies when can be written as a sum or product of:   Polynomials, like  Exponentials, like  Sine and cosine functions, like  Any sum or product of these function types   Functions such as , , or fall outside this category. For those, we'll need a different method entirely. But for the allowed types, this method offers a fast and reliable way to select .   üìñ‚ùì When to Guess   Which types of forcing functions are suitable for the Method of Undetermined Coefficients?      Polynomial functions like  Correct! Polynomial functions are suitable for this method.    Exponential functions like  Correct! Exponential functions are also suitable.    Sine or cosine functions like or  Correct! Sine and cosine functions are suitable as well.    Functions like or  Not quite. The method does not apply to logarithmic or tangent functions.       Combining Basic Forms via Addition  If is a sum of different function types, say a polynomial plus an exponential, then should be a sum of the corresponding matching forms.   Initial form of   Use to identify the appropriate form of in each case.      This matches is exponential plus constant, so: .         Both terms have the same argument, , the form is the standard  .         This combines exponential and sine, so we need: .         Cosines with different arguments requires the sum of two forms:         üìñ‚ùì Sum of particular solution forms   Select the initial form of the particular solution for an LNCC equation with forcing function: .      Incorrect. Derivatives of this form will not yield a term.     Incorrect. This form is missing a term.     Incorrect. This form is inappropriate since the forcing function is not a product of an exponential function and sine or cosine functions.     Correct! Although the forcing function does not contain a cosine term, the derivatives of cosine terms can still produce sine terms.       Combining Basic Forms via Multiplication  If the forcing function is a product of basic function types‚Äîsuch as a polynomial times an exponential‚Äîthen the particular solution must also be a product of their matching forms. For example, the differential equation  , has a forcing function that is a quadratic times an exponential, so we start with: .  However, be careful: multiplying by just makes new coefficients:   Since each pair can be merged as single coefficient, we just relabel them:   We'll use this simplification trick often. It keeps the form of clean and will make solving for , and much easier later.   üìñ‚ùì Product of particular solution forms   Select the initial form of the particular solution for an LNCC equation with forcing function: .      Correct! The forcing function is the product of a 2nd degree polynomial and an exponential function, so the particular solution should be the product the most general 2nd degree polynomial and an exponential function.     Incorrect. Although this form perfectly matches the form of the forcing function, the solution could potentially include and constant terms.     Incorrect. The term also needs a coefficient.     Incorrect. The extra coefficient is unnecessary, as it can be absorbed into the constants and .     Initial form of - Products of Forms   For each of the following forcing functions, select an appropriate initial form of . Simplify by combining or eliminating any redundant constants.      This is an exponential times a cosine: . However, distributing shows that it is redundant and we relabel as: .         The forcing function simplifies: , so:          This is a 3rd degree polynomial times a cosine. So, initially we set: .  Multiplying the polynomial onto sine and cosine, gives us .  Distributing and shows that they are redundant, so we relabel as follows:          Here, both terms involve powers of times trig functions. But we don't need separate guesses‚Äîone form covers both:   This form includes the term and also handles automatically.       With these examples and the table as a guide, you're now equipped to handle both additive and multiplicative combinations in . Next, we'll deal with one last wrinkle: what to do if accidentally overlaps with the homogeneous solution .   üìñ‚ùì Matching Forcing Function (with Products) to   By dragging from left to right, match the forcing functions to the appropriate initial form of .                                             Modifying Particular Solutions  We now know how to choose a form for based on the structure of , but there's one final complication: If a term in a term in the homogeneous solution , then that term cannot contribute to generating . Instead, it will give zero, since that is what terms in do when substituted into the differential equation.  To fix this, we multiply the overlapping part of by . If there's still overlap, we multiply by again‚Äîrepeating until shares no like-terms with .  For example, consider: The homogeneous solution and the initial particular solution are: .  Notice that and in contain the like terms: and . This means that plugging into the left side of the equation will simplify to , not , as required.  So we modify by multiplying the conflicting term by :   Now, has no terms in common with , ensuring that they are independent.   Modification Rule for the Particular Solution  If any term in your guess for also appears in , multiply that term by the independent variable . Repeat as needed until all overlapping terms are eliminated.    üìñ‚ùì Handling Like Terms   What should you do if contains a term also present in ?     Multiply the term in by the independent variable.    Delete the term from .    Multiply the term in by the independent variable.    Use integration to eliminate the term.     Let's work through some examples where modification is required, and see how this rule plays out.  Modifying the Initial Form of   For each LNCC equation below:  Find the homogeneous solution .  Select the initial form of .  Modify to ensure it has no overlap with .            The characteristic equation is , which has a repeated root: . So, .     The natural guess for to match is .    Since is in , we multiply by :   But, is still in , so we repeat: .              Since the characteristic equation is , the roots are: and .    The guess for is .    Only the and terms conflict. Modify them: .              The characteristic equation , has roots: , leading to .    The initial guess for is .    No modification is needed since doesn't appear in .               The characteristic equation , has the repeated solution , so .    The initial guess for is: .    Multiplying out and helps show that and are conflicting terms. Multiplying all terms by gives the correct form: .          Now that we know how to construct an appropriate and independent form for , the last step is to determine the values of the unknown coefficients.   üìñ‚ùì Select the Correct Form of   Consider the linear non-homogeneous constant coefficient equation . Given that the homogeneous solution is , select the form of the particular solution after any necessary modifications.       Incorrect. This would be the correct initial form for the particular solution, but not the final form.      Incorrect. Don't create the particular solution form based on the homogeneous solution.      Incorrect. This form indicates the forcing function contains the product of a first degree polynomial and an exponential function.      Correct! The initial form would be , but a like-term is also in . One multiplication by resolves this.        To choose , match its structure to the form of (polynomial, exponential, sine, cosine, or combinations).  For sums like , build as the sum of matching forms.  For products like , multiply the forms, but look out for redundant constants.  If overlaps with , multiply the conflicting terms in by until they are independent.

Using only this information, list out everything you can deduce about the differential equation.     Why do we modify the particular solution by multiplying it by when solving LNCC equations?  Why do we modify the particular solution by multiplying it by when solving LNCC equations?    We modify by multiplying it by to ensure that the particular solution does not share any terms with the homogeneous solution . This adjustment makes and independent, ensuring that the general solution properly represents the nonhomogeneous term of the differential equation.    In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do and play, and why is it important that they are independent?  In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do and play, and why is it important that they are independent?      represents the solution to the homogeneous equation (where the nonhomogeneous term is zero), while represents a particular solution that accounts for the nonhomogeneous term. It is important that they are independent so that their combined terms accurately reflect the behavior of both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts of the original differential equation.      Describe the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation.    A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives. For example, the equation is non-homogeneous because of the term on the right side, which is not a derivative or multiple of .

In the general solution of an LNCC equation, what roles do and play, and why is it important that they are independent?      represents the solution to the homogeneous equation (where the nonhomogeneous term is zero), while represents a particular solution that accounts for the nonhomogeneous term. It is important that they are independent so that their combined terms accurately reflect the behavior of both the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts of the original differential equation.      Describe the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation.    A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives. For example, the equation is non-homogeneous because of the term on the right side, which is not a derivative or multiple of . The distinction between homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations is crucial as the methods used to solve them can differ.    "

  "title": "Derivative Transfer via Integration by Parts",
  "body": " Derivative Transfer via Integration by Parts   Before we apply the Laplace transform to solve differential equations, we need to understand its foundational mechanism: transferring derivatives within an integral. This section begins with a quick refresher on integration by parts (IBP), emphasizing how derivatives applied to one function can be shifted to another. This transfer process is the key that unlocks the Laplace transform method.   Differentiation and Integration Essentials  Let's quickly review two essential tools: how exponentials behave under differentiation, and the integration by parts formula we will use throughout this chapter.    üìñ‚ùì Exponential Derivatives   Match each exponential function with its derivative with respect to . Assume is constant.                           üìñ‚ùì Integration by Parts   Click on the correct integration by parts formula.                          Review of Integration by Parts (IBP)  Integration by parts is a core calculus technique that allows us to transfer derivatives from one function to another inside an integral. Its most common form is: .  When and are functions of , we get a version of IBP which makes the transfer of derivatives more clear:   This simple idea of shifting derivatives is the basis for the Laplace transform method. We'll see it in action when one of the functions is .   üìñ‚ùì Derivative Transfer Technique   Which concept from calculus allows you to transfer the derivative of one function to another inside an integral?     Chain Rule   Incorrect. The chain rule is used for function compositions, not transferring derivatives within an integral.     L'H√¥pital's Rule   Incorrect. L'H√¥pital's Rule helps evaluate indeterminate limits, not manipulate derivatives inside integrals.     Integration by Parts   Correct! Integration by parts is the key tool that shifts derivatives between functions inside integrals.     Implicit Differentiation   Incorrect. Implicit differentiation helps with equations where the dependent variable isn't isolated.        Using Exponentials to Transfer Derivatives   üëÄ Review: Derivative of   Let be a constant. Which function is equal to the derivative ?       Correct! The derivative of with respect to is by the chain rule.       Incorrect. You're missing the from the chain rule.       Incorrect. The sign should be negative because the exponent is .       Incorrect. This form appears when integrating, not differentiating. Try applying the chain rule.      Let's now see why exponentials make this derivative transfer especially useful. Suppose we choose and . Differentiating gives and . Applying integration by parts yields:   Notice the key point: the derivative on has been completely removed. Instead, we get two terms: a boundary term and a new integral without .  This trade is usually worth it since in the context of Laplace transforms, the term will often vanish and is the given initial condition.     Integration by parts lets you shift derivatives from one function to another within an integral.  Choosing causes derivatives on to transfer onto the exponential, producing a simple factor of .  Understanding this transfer mechanism explains where the variable comes from and why it appears in Laplace transform formulas.        üìñ‚ùì Key Concepts Behind Laplace Transforms   Which two core mathematical ideas does the Laplace transform method rely on to solve differential equations?     Chain Rule   Incorrect. The chain rule is not central to the Laplace transform method. Think about a process that lets you transfer derivatives.     Product Rule   No, the product rule is not a key idea in the Laplace transform method. Consider an integration-based technique.     Integration by Parts   Correct! Integration by parts allows derivatives to be transferred between functions inside an integral, a foundational technique in the Laplace method.     Properties of Exponential Functions   Correct! The method uses properties of exponential functions, especially their predictable behavior under differentiation and integration.       üìñ‚ùì IBP on   Select the result of applying integration by parts to .   Don't think of this as a Calculus exercise. Instead, try to think about transferring derivatives.        Incorrect. A correct application of integration by parts must include the right choice of and . Try again.       Incorrect. Be sure you're transferring the derivative and integrating the right part.       Incorrect. This result skips important parts of the integration by parts formula.       Correct! Integration by parts with and gives this result.         "

  "title": "Defining the Laplace Transform",
  "body": " Defining the Laplace Transform   We've seen how integration by parts transfers derivatives from one function to another inside an integral. Now we take the next step: defining a transform that systematically applies this principle.  In this section, we'll see how this transform is constructed and how it converts functions of into functions of . You'll also see how to compute Laplace transforms from the definition.    Why Use the Laplace Transform?  To see where we're headed, imagine you need to solve the differential equation   Suppose you multiply both sides by and integrate with respect to :   The left-hand side contains a derivative inside the integral. From the previous section, you know we can transfer this derivative to the exponential function. Doing so removes the derivative from , essentially allowing you to use algebra to isolate it.  This is the idea behind the Laplace transform and the motivation for its definition.    Definition of the Laplace Transform  Laplace Transform   Given a function defined for , its Laplace transform, denoted , is defined by provided the integral converges. The result is a new function, typically written as a capitalized version of the variable you are transforming. In this case:      üìñ‚ùì Spot the Error in the Definition   Click on the incorrect part of the Laplace transform definition.                       Working with Improper Integrals  Notice that the Laplace transform involves an improper integral: the upper limit is . In calculus, we handle this by replacing with a variable , computing the definite integral, and then taking the limit as : .  When calculating Laplace transforms, you first compute the integral with respect to , treating as a constant. Then you compute the limit of the result as approaches .  The Laplace transform exists if this limit produces a finite value. Often, exponential decay from guarantees convergence when is large enough.   üìñ‚ùì Convergence Requirement for Laplace Transforms   To compute an improper integral, you write it as a limit of a definite integral. For example, .  Select variables\/constants would you expect to see after computing the integral, , but before taking the limit.       The variable is a constant in so it will also appear in the antiderivative.     The variable gets plugged into after you find the antiderivative.     Since the variable of integration is , you plug the limits of integration, and , into once you have the antiderivative.    (integration constant)  We are computing a definite integral, not an indefinite one.        üëÄ Quick Review: Exponential Properties  To get through the transform rule derivations, you'll need to be familiar with some key exponential properties that will appear throughtout this chapter.   Exponential Antiderivative  For any constant , we have: . While this can be found by substituting , it is such a common antiderivative that you should just know it without this extra step.    Exponential End Behavior  The end behavior can be seen from the most basic exponential function:             In general, the end behavior depends on whether the power goes to or :      In this section, we will take limits as . Your goal will be to figure out if causes the power to go to or . Only then will you know where goes.   üìñ‚ùì Checkpoint: Exponential Properties   Exponential Antiderivative   Evaluate:            Exponential End Behavior   Determine if each limit is -·Äë, , or ·Äë.

You'll see how emerges naturally from this process.  In upcoming sections, we'll build a library of Laplace transforms for the most common functions and learn properties that make these computations even faster.

Learning these transforms will allow you to compute Laplace transforms quickly, without evaluating integrals from scratch each time.  We'll derive these formulas using straightforward examples and then generalize the results. You'll see how the Laplace transform simplifies when applied to each type of function and how certain patterns repeat across different cases.

  "body": " Transform Properties and Rules   So far, we've built a small library of Laplace transforms for basic functions. But how do we handle functions that are combinations of these basic functions? This is where the properties of Laplace transform comes in.  In this section, we'll learn how the Laplace transform interacts with sums, products, exponentials, derivatives, and powers of . Each property gives us a shortcut: a way to break down complex functions into simpler parts using the transforms we already know.  These properties will be your main tools for solving differential equations quickly and efficiently.   üëÄ‚ùì Integral Properties   Select all the true statements related to properties of indefinite integrals.      This is the linearity property of integrals.     Since we are integrating with respect to , we can treat as a constant.     In calculus, you had to integrate this using integration by parts.     Be careful, .       Linearity: Sums and Constant Multiples  Like integrals, the Laplace transform is linear. This means we can take apart sums and pull out constant multiples. In particular, if the Laplace transforms of and exist, then we have the following linearity property:   This property allows us to break complex expressions into smaller pieces, each of which can be transformed using our basic table.   Transforming a Sum of Functions   Compute the Laplace transform .    We apply the linearity property to break the transform down as follows:   Then, using the common transforms, L , L ( ) , and L ( ) , we get   We use , because it guarantees that is also true.      üìñ‚ùì Invalid Uses of Linearity   Which of the following are NOT correct applications of the linearity property?       Linearity does not apply to a product of functions.     The linearity property does not extend to powers of functions.     This is a correct use of the linearity property.     This is correct since .      üìñ‚ùì Transform of            Correct! Use linearity: transform each term individually and add them together.       No, the transform of includes in the numerator, and the constant should be added.       No, the frequency of is 1, not 7, and the constant term transforms to .       No, the constant term should yield , and it should be added.         Derivatives of Functions (Derivative Transfer)  One of the most powerful features of the Laplace transform is its ability to transform differential equations into algebraic equations. This means we need a way to remove the derivatives from the unknown in our differential equation. The following property perfectly encapsulates this idea:   In short, this property uses integration by parts to transfer the derivative from to . This results in a factor of (chain rule on ) and as follows:  .  Click here for more details   To show that , we start with the definition of the Laplace transform:   .  Applying integration by parts to once in with integration by parts gives   Recall that a requirement for the Laplace transform of to exist is that .  Thus, setting the limit to zero gives us the desired result .     üìñ‚ùì Fill-In the Missing Number   Give the number that goes into the blank.            An integer variable may be initialized to a value.     .*  Try to figure out the function in this case.

This transformation makes it easier to isolate the unknown and move toward a solution.    Crossing Into the Laplace Domain  In terms of the roadmap, we can visualize this first step as follows:  Step 1Ô∏è‚É£: Into the Laplace Domain (Forward Transform)                             Simply put, forward transforming a differential equation into the Laplace domain means applying the Laplace transform to both sides of the equation. The result is an algebraic equation where the derivatives have been converted into powers of and the new unknown is .    Basic Mechanics of the Forward Transform  Symbolically, applying the forward Laplace transform to the differential equation amounts to applying it to both sides of the equation as follows: .

This is where the initial conditions come into play. Substituting the initial conditions and simplifying gives the desired Laplace domain equation:  . Our new unknown is and since the derivatives have been eliminated, we can use algebra to solve for it. In fact, the solution to our differential equation is actually hiding inside . So, by solving for you are also solving for at the same time!  Let's practice this with a one more example.   Forward Transforming Equations   Forward transform the following equations into the Laplace domain:     First applying the Laplace transform to both sides:  . Now, use the linearity property :  .

Since the Laplace transform only applies to functions, applying a forward transform to a differential equation , really means we are taking the Laplace transform to both sides of that equation. So, applying a forward transformation to the initial-value problem implies that we multiply both sides of the equation by and integrate from to :              Next, we use the linearity of the integral:      After applying integration by parts to , the derivative is transferred from to , resulting in a factor of and an evaluation of at and :              The details for computing are given here .

This means using standard algebra to isolate on one side of the equation. Here is a quick example.   Solving a Laplace-Domain Equation   Solve the Laplace-domain equation for :     Start by moving all non- terms to the right-hand side:   Now, factor from the remaining terms on the left-hand side:   Finally, divide both sides by the quadratic expression to isolate :       Preparing for the Inverse Transform   Once you've solved for , the next step is to prepare it for returning to the original domain. This means rewriting as a combination of expressions that match known Laplace transforms, so we can use the inverse transform to find .  The inverse Laplace transform works by reversing the process of the forward transform. This can be done using the same table of transforms ‚Äîbut in reverse. Our goal is to express as a sum of terms that match entries in the -domain column.    Preparation Guidelines  After isolating from the transformed equation, you typically are left with a messy combination of rational functions in the variable .  Since we can only invert functions in the -domain column of the table of common Laplace transforms , it helps to list them out to guide us on how to prepare .                      To invert , it must first be written as the sum of one or more of these terms. However, since the first row is a special case of the second when , we can reduce the list down to the following function types:   Fortunately, there is a technique that was designed for this exact task. Recall that partial fraction decomposition (PFD) guarantees that any rational function can be written as the sum of rational terms with linear or quadratic factors in the denominator.  Therefore, if the denominator of has degree three or higher, PFD will always be your first step toward preparing for a backward transform out of the Laplace domain.    Dealing with Quadratic Denominators  After partial fraction decomposition, will be the sum of rational terms with either a linear or quadratic factor in the denominator.

In contrast, if at least one term has a quadratic denominator then it will be of the form . where we have omitted the numerator since will be not be important to this discussion.  Notice that the denominator is not nicely factored like you see in the transform table. To achieve this, we need to complete the square .  Note that if the quadratic denominator term was the result of partial fraction decomposition, then it cannot be reduced further and you should skip directly to completing the square of the denominator. However, if started with this form, then you should first check to see if the denominator is factorable. If so, then use PFD.

We used forward Laplace transforms to move from to , solved for , and simplified it to match known inverse forms.  Now, it's time to take the final step: returning to the original domain where the solution is a function of time. To do this, we apply the inverse Laplace transform , denoted , which undoes the effect of the forward transform.    What Is the Inverse Laplace Transform?  Symbolically, the inverse Laplace transform works much like the inverse of a standard function. For example, we can release from inside the cosine by applying the inverse cosine:   Similarly, we can release from inside a Laplace transform by applying its inverse:   This is the idea behind the final step of the Laplace transform method as it takes us back into the original domain by releasing the contained inside . Visually, this looks like:  Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Out of the Laplace Domain (Backward Transform)                              üìñ‚ùì What does the inverse transform do?   What is the purpose of the inverse Laplace transform in solving a differential equation?     It recovers the original function from its Laplace-transformed version .  Correct! The inverse transform brings us back to the time domain.    It rewrites a differential equation using algebra.  That's what the forward transform does.    It simplifies partial fractions.  Partial fraction decomposition helps prepare for the inverse, but isn't the transform itself.    It evaluates the Laplace transform of .  This describes the forward transform, not the inverse.       Using the Table to Invert  During the forward step, we used the table to map functions of in the -domain column, like or , into functions of in the -domain column. Now, we'll do the opposite: match terms in to the forms in the -domain column and map them back to functions in the -domain column.  For example, suppose we have the following in the Laplace domain:   To return back this to the original domain we apply the inverse to both sides:   We have , but it needs to be a function of . For that, we match to one of the forms in the -domain column of the table .  We see the best match is L with , so we get:   Inverses using the Laplace Transform Table   Apply the inverse transform to reveal the solution, , in the original domain.         This matches L with . So, .           This matches L with and . So, .           Noting that and using L with , we get .          üìñ‚ùì Use the Transform Table   For each , use the table of transforms to determine .                                           üìñ‚ùìTable Matching Checkpoint  Which of the following is the correct inverse Laplace transform of ?     Correct! This matches L 6 with , .     This is missing the exponential factor .     This flips and . Be careful when matching the form.     This would require in the numerator and instead of .      So far, we've only dealt with expressions that match a single row in the transform table. But most Laplace domain solutions are a sum of multiple terms. Fortunately, we don't need to invert the entire thing at once. We'll use linearity to handle those in the next section.    Linearity of the Inverse Laplace Transform  Most Laplace-domain solutions are not single terms. Instead, they're sums of several expressions. Fortunately, like the forward transform, the inverse Laplace transform is also linear. This means that inverse transforms of sums and constant multiples of functions can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps.  Assuming and are functions in the Laplace domain, then we have:   Here's an example of this linearity property in action.   Inverse Transform of a Sum   Find if .    We break this into two parts and use the transform table to invert each one.   The first term matches L and gives . The second term matches L with , giving . So the solution is:      üìñ‚ùì Apply Linearity  Suppose . What is ?     Perfect! The first term matches and the second is a sine with .     Double check the sign in . It corresponds to , not .     The second term matches a sine form, not cosine.     corresponds to , not a polynomial term.     Linearity makes inverting multi-term expressions much more manageable. Sometimes you'll run into expressions that don't quite match anything in the table. They're close‚Äîbut not perfect. In the next section, we'll look at how to make small algebraic adjustments that bring those expressions into a form we can invert.    Minor Adjustments for a Perfect Match   Sometimes, the Laplace-domain function is close to a known table form‚Äîbut not quite there. In these cases, a few algebraic adjustments will help reveal the match. These are not major rewrites, just small nudges: splitting a numerator, factoring out constants, or rewriting terms to expose a recognizable pattern.    Separate Fractions to Match Multiple Forms  Suppose your function has a sum in the numerator, like . The denominator matches both sine and cosine forms in the table, but the numerator doesn't match any of the entries. The fix? Separate the addition in the numerator:  . Then factor constants and attempt to match with the table again:  . The first term perfectly matches, the second term needs in the numerator. Missing numbers in the numerator is common with inverse transforms, but there is an easy fix. We multiply numerator and denominator by the missing number:  üö© Multiplying by   is just a special form of ; multiplying by it doesn't change the fraction.   . With these minor adjustments, the inverse transform becomes straightforward: .   üìñ‚ùìSplitting to Match Table Forms   Which of the following functions can be split into separate terms that match known inverse Laplace transforms?       Incorrect. This function already matches a known sine form and doesn't require splitting.       Correct! This function can be split as , matching cosine and sine forms.       Incorrect. This function already matches and does not require splitting.        Adding and Subtracting to Match Shifts  Some forms contain a shift, like . For example, the form looks similar to L , but the numerator should be . This can be fixed by subtracting and adding , like so:  üö© Adding   is just a special form of ; adding it to the numerator doesn't change the fraction.    Now you can separate the fraction as before:   These can be a little tricky so here's a few additional examples to prepare you for what you may encounter.  Handling Coefficients on   Find if     The first term needs in the numerator, but before adding and subtracting , let's get out of the way by factoring it out:  . Now, splitting the fraction inside the parentheses and distributing the gives us  . Finally, the backward transform is given by  .    üìñ‚ùìGive the Numerator of the Split Fractions   After adjusting the numerator to match L and separating the fractions, type-in the numerators of the separated fractions?                          The answers you enter should be fully simplified.      s\\s*-\\s*1|-1\\s*\\+\\s*s  .*  Incorrect     2|-\\s*1\\s*\\+\\s*3  .*  Incorrect      Complete the Square First   Find if     Completing the square for the denominator of gives: .  The form of the denominator and the in the numerator indicates that we are trying to match L ( , ), but we need in the numerator. So we add and subtract , then split the fraction:  . Since the second term needs a in the numerator, we multiply it by :  . From here, the inverse transform comes from the table:  .    üìñ‚ùìGive the Next Step   What is the next step toward finding the inverse of ?      Factor the denominator   Incorrect. The quadratic cannot be factored; try something else.     Complete the square in the denominator   Correct! Completing the square helps you match the form needed to invert with L .     Cancel out the in the numerator and denominator.   Canceling parts of rational expressions like this isn't valid.     Differentiate the entire function   Nope‚Äîthis isn't a derivative problem.       With practice, these adjustments become intuitive, greatly simplifying the process of leaving the Laplace domain to recover the solution to the original differential equation.    Step 3 ‚Äî Leaving the Laplace Domain Summary  Apply the inverse transform term-by-term to , converting the algebraic answer back into the time-domain solution .     The inverse Laplace transform recovers the solution to the differential equation you are trying to solve. .  Once the terms of match the forms in the transform table, the inverse is the function of in the same row.  If is a sum of terms, use linearity to invert each part separately.  If is close but doesn't match a table entry, try splitting the numerator, factoring constants, or completing the square.  Always look at the denominator when matching forms in the table, they provide the best way to identify the correct form to match.        üìñ‚ùìAdjusting the Numerator   Select the number that belongs in both blanks to directly apply the inverse.       Correct!     Incorrect.     Incorrect.     Incorrect.      üìñ‚ùìFind the Inverse Transform         Correct! The function can be split as , which corresponds to and .       Incorrect.

Completing the square is a technique used to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms, particularly those involving sine and cosine functions.      Why is partial fraction decomposition helpful in finding inverse Laplace transforms?     Partial fraction decomposition breaks down complex rational functions into simpler fractions that correspond to known inverse Laplace transforms, making the transformation process easier.    Why is the Laplace Transform Method considered a powerful tool for solving differential equations?     What role does the table of common Laplace transforms play in the Laplace Transform Method?      Explain how the Laplace transform simplifies solving linear differential equations. Include a discussion of how initial conditions are incorporated into the transformed equation.    The Laplace transform converts a linear differential equation into an algebraic equation in the -domain. This simplification occurs because the transform converts derivatives into polynomials of , reducing the differential equation to a solvable algebraic equation. Initial conditions are directly incorporated into the transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include constants that reflect the initial values of the function and its derivatives. This allows the solution of the equation to be found more easily in the -domain, before applying the inverse Laplace transform to return to the time domain.

As in the previous examples, the denominator is a second-degree polynomial; therefore it is sensible for us to begin by completing the square in the denominator as we did in the previous two examples.   Take a careful look at the denominator here. It's really close to matching or , but it is not a match because of the negative sign in front of the We need to change course when this happens. Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a partial fraction decomposition.   Margin note: If you need to review partial fraction decomposition, go HERE.    We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like-terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.          Since has a quadratic function in the denominator, it makes sense that we would try to match it with one of the forms above, however, the form of the numerator suggests matching it with the second expression.  As we mentioned earlier, we'll try to make the denominator match first. Since both of the forms we're trying to match are of the form we will complete the square first: (If you still don't remember how to complete the square, look up that primer and do the previous exercises in that section above.)  Let's rewrite the given expression as follows.   We've got the denominator in exactly the right form, it looks just like with and . As in the previous section, once we've gotten the denominator in shape, we turn our attention to the numerator. If we look back at the two forms we are trying to match, we see that our expression has an in the numerator, so it's more like . It would be exactly right if we had in the numerator, which in this case would be .  What we do have in the numerator is ; and we would like it to be which means if we added 4, we'd have exactly the right thing. If we want to add 4, we'll need to compensate by also subtracting 4, like this:   Great! Now we can split this single fraction into two separate fractions: We're almost there! The first fraction is a perfect match for the form (with and ); but we still have another expression that is not yet a match. The remaining fraction looks like it could eventually match the form . We would need to have a 5 in the numerator, and we currently have a 4. But we can fix that as we did in the previous section: Now let's put it all together. Here's everything we did:   As mentioned before, being able to use appropriate algebra to \"match\" forms is really important when we work with Laplace Transforms. Since it's really just algebra, now is a great time to practice that skill, so when we are in the middle of studying Laplace Transforms, you can just focus on the \"new\" stuff.                                               Backward Transforms- Level 3                   First, factor the denominator as . Then, decompose the expression into . Solving for and , you get the inverse Laplace transform as .                                   Note that as the quadratic term in the denominator does not factor, the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor and a repeated linear factor. We'll proceed by simplifying this complicated fraction with a Partial Fraction Decomposition of the form   You may also consider using technology to find a partial fraction decomposition.

Apply the Laplace Transform to it  Given an initial-valued problem ...       Explain the significance of completing the square in finding inverse Laplace transforms.     Completing the square is a technique used to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms, particularly those involving sine and cosine functions.      Why is partial fraction decomposition helpful in finding inverse Laplace transforms?     Partial fraction decomposition breaks down complex rational functions into simpler fractions that correspond to known inverse Laplace transforms, making the transformation process easier.    Why is the Laplace Transform Method considered a powerful tool for solving differential equations?     What role does the table of common Laplace transforms play in the Laplace Transform Method?      Explain how the Laplace transform simplifies solving linear differential equations. Include a discussion of how initial conditions are incorporated into the transformed equation.    The Laplace transform converts a linear differential equation into an algebraic equation in the -domain. This simplification occurs because the transform converts derivatives into polynomials of , reducing the differential equation to a solvable algebraic equation. Initial conditions are directly incorporated into the transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include constants that reflect the initial values of the function and its derivatives. This allows the solution of the equation to be found more easily in the -domain, before applying the inverse Laplace transform to return to the time domain.

We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like-terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.    "

  "body": "     Since has a quadratic function in the denominator, it makes sense that we would try to match it with one of the forms above, however, the form of the numerator suggests matching it with the second expression.  As we mentioned earlier, we'll try to make the denominator match first. Since both of the forms we're trying to match are of the form we will complete the square first: (If you still don't remember how to complete the square, look up that primer and do the previous exercises in that section above.)  Let's rewrite the given expression as follows.   We've got the denominator in exactly the right form, it looks just like with and . As in the previous section, once we've gotten the denominator in shape, we turn our attention to the numerator. If we look back at the two forms we are trying to match, we see that our expression has an in the numerator, so it's more like . It would be exactly right if we had in the numerator, which in this case would be .  What we do have in the numerator is ; and we would like it to be which means if we added 4, we'd have exactly the right thing. If we want to add 4, we'll need to compensate by also subtracting 4, like this:   Great! Now we can split this single fraction into two separate fractions: We're almost there! The first fraction is a perfect match for the form (with and ); but we still have another expression that is not yet a match. The remaining fraction looks like it could eventually match the form . We would need to have a 5 in the numerator, and we currently have a 4. But we can fix that as we did in the previous section: Now let's put it all together. Here's everything we did:   As mentioned before, being able to use appropriate algebra to \"match\" forms is really important when we work with Laplace Transforms. Since it's really just algebra, now is a great time to practice that skill, so when we are in the middle of studying Laplace Transforms, you can just focus on the \"new\" stuff.   "

What if you need the opposite behavior ‚Äî a switch that turns a function OFF at ?  This reverse behavior can be built using the unit step function itself.

This is just a shifted version of , not a piecewise function that shuts off.      With both and in hand, you can now switch functions ON or OFF exactly when you need. Next, we will cover the last switch that turns ON functions for a limited window of time, over a finite interval.

The final variant combines the first two ideas to create a time window where a function is ON for a limited interval, then turns OFF again.  We can build this behavior by subtracting two step functions:  turns ON at .  turns ON at , flipping us back to OFF since we are subtracting.  So the difference is the ON-window we need.   üìú Windowed Unit Step Function    Between and , is ON and OFF otherwise.

  "body": " Piecewise Functions   Piecewise functions can feel disorganized at first since they are defined in separate chunks across different intervals. But there's a powerful way to express them as a clean formula: by using step functions to switch each piece ON or OFF at the right time.    What Makes a Function Piecewise?  A piecewise function is any function built from different parts over specific regions of its domain. For example:            Each piece has its own behavior, but together they create the entire function. The question is: can we rewrite these separate pieces so that the whole function is described with one equation, instead of a case-by-case breakdown?    Thinking in Terms of Switches   üìñ‚ùì Match Step Functions to Their Piecewise Definitions   By dragging from left to right, match the function on the left to the equivalent piecewise function on the right. Note that, .                       Every step function you've seen can be thought of as a simple ON‚ÄìOFF switch:   With these step functions, you can literally program when each part of a function is ON and when it is OFF.  For example, the three pieces of above can be controlled like this:    Three pieces of                       Rewriting a Piecewise Function in Step Form   üìñ‚ùì Matching Step Types to Intervals   Match each time interval to the type of unit step expression that would activate a function over that range.    These pairings are essential when converting a piecewise function into unit step form. The form you choose depends entirely on where each piece is active.                       shows three non-overlapping regions. That means for any value of , only one piece of the function is active. Because of this, we can write as a single sum:  . Let's test this step-function version by plugging in a few values and seeing which terms turn ON and which turn OFF.   Like the piecewise form, plugging a specific value into was the same as plugging it into just one of its three pieces. This observation highlights why the unit step form is equivalent to the piecewise form.   üìú Converting Piecewise Form to Unit Step Form  Here's a strategy for converting any piecewise function into step form:  Find the intervals where each piece is active.  Match the active interval for each piece to its step function switch:     Piece  Active Interval  Step Function Switch                    Multiply the piece by its switch, then add them all together.      üìñ‚ùì Which Term Matches the Interval?   You're converting a piecewise function into step form. Which term below correctly captures a piece of the function that is active only for ?       This turns ON before and OFF after. We want something that activates at and deactivates at .       This starts at and keeps going. It doesn't define an interval, it defines a forever switch.       Exactly. This is the window function that's ON from to and OFF otherwise.       Close, but this would result in on , not . Try reversing the order of the terms.      Now you're ready to try a few full conversions yourself.   Using to Turn ON Sine    Rewrite the function using a unit step function.     Since turns ON at , we multiply it by :   Plugging in , confirms we arrived at the correct piecewise function: and has the following graph    Graph of            Converting to Unit Step Form   Rewrite the following piecewise functions using unit step notation:            The first piece is active before , so we use .

There are three pieces:  is ON from ‚Üí use  is ON from ‚Üí use  is ON for ‚Üí use , though it contributes nothing    Putting it together:   Distribute and combine like unit step terms:     From here on out, we'll use this compact step-function form whenever we need to handle piecewise forcing functions. This also unlocks the Laplace transform method for problems that contain piecewise forcing functions.     Step functions are mathematical ON\/OFF switches that let you control which piece is active.  By multiplying each piece by the right step expression, you can combine them into one neat formula.

  "body": " Laplace Transform Rules for Step Functions   Up to this point, you've seen how unit step functions can switch pieces of a function ON and OFF at the right times. But to actually use these functions in solving differential equations, we need to understand how they behave when we take their Laplace transform.  This section develops the Laplace transform rules for unit step functions:   ‚Äì how to transform a single step switch.  ‚Äì how to transform a function that is switched ON at .  ‚Äì how to transform a shifted function that starts at .   These rules are the backbone for handling piecewise functions with Laplace methods.    üìñ‚ùì How Do Inputs Shift?   The function is the same as shifted left by 2 units.    Replacing with shifts the graph to the left by units. This is the opposite direction compared to .     Transform of  We begin with the Laplace transform of a single shifted unit step switch, . Finding its transform lays the groundwork for the more general rules that follow.  The Laplace transform of a shifted unit step function is as follows:   üìú Laplace Transform of     üí° Derivation of  Start with the definition of the Laplace transform:   Recall that: which means the integrand is zero until and equals afterward.  That trims our integral down since:   Evaluate the improper integral as a limit:   As long as , the term goes to zero as , leaving:      This result shows that the shifted unit step function introduces an exponential factor in the Laplace domain. You will use it to transform terms of the form , where is a constant. For example,    üìñ‚ùìFinding the Laplace Transform of   What is the Laplace transform of ?       Close, but is a variable in the Laplace domain, it doesn't get replaced by a number here.       That's the formula: , and here .       That's the transform of , not a step function. The exponential in appears in the numerator, not the exponent of the input.       That's an incorrect inversion of the formula. The exponential should be in the numerator, and in the denominator.        Transform of  The next rule provides a formula for the product of a step function and a function of and will be the primary tool used when forward transforming a piecewise function.   üìú Laplace Transform of    üí° Derivation of  Start with the Laplace transform definition:   Since for , the integral simplifies to:   This new integral looks a lot like the Laplace transform of , but it starts at instead of . Luckily, we can shift the graph of to the left units to force the integral start back at .  Note: Shifting a function units to the left means adding to all of the inputs:   Using this idea, leads to the desired transform:   Details   : Shifting to the left units makes it and starts the integral at .   : Exponential Property    : Factor out the constant, , as we are integrating in .   Therefore,      Let's try this on a few examples to see how the rule works in practice.   Transform of   Compute the Laplace transform of .    For this problem, we have . So the rule becomes: , where, in our case, , so .  Plugging and into the rule shows us that   So all we have left to do is compute : and plug it into (‚≠ê), to complete the transform:     Check Your Understanding   üìñ‚ùìApply the Rule for   What is the Laplace transform of ?       Close, but we must shift the input inside the function, not leave it as .       Correct. The shift rule says to replace with inside the function and multiply by .       Be careful, shifts the function right, but the rule calls for when we delay the function using .       This uses the right format, but doesn't evaluate the Laplace transform. We're looking for a formula that includes the exponential shift.       üìñ‚ùìNext Step for the Rule   Suppose you want use L to find . You note that and update the rule as follows: . What's the best next step from here?     Identify , find .  Correct ‚Äî you need to compute .    Find .  Finding isn't needed for this rule.    Find .  This does not help you compute .    Rewrite the rule by moving to the denominator as .  You could do this, but there is a better answer.        Transform of  Finally, we cover the last rule that will be particularly useful for inverting expressions in the Laplace domain (i.e., step 3 ) that are associated with step functions.   üìú Laplace Transform of     Derivation of  In terms of the definition of the Laplace transform, we want to show:   To show this, we will start with the integral on the left and show it leads to the integral on the right.   Details   : on makes the lower limit of the integral .   : Shifting to the left units makes it and starts the integral at .   : Use the exponential property and factor out the constant, , as we are integrating in .   Thus, we have shown where .     Although you can use this for forward transforms, its main utility is for backward transforms since it only requires you to match terms that look like where is one of the common Laplace transforms from the same table. We will explore later when we invert terms in the Laplace domain containing .   üìñ‚ùìIdentify the Shifted Input   Select the expression that goes in the blank.       Good! The rule requires replacing with when multiplying by .     Not quite ‚Äî you need to shift the input to because the step turns ON at .     Incorrect, try again.     Incorrect, try again.

With these tools, we're ready for the real payoff: transforming entire piecewise functions .    General Strategy  The game plan for handling a piecewise function in the Laplace domain is always the same three steps.   üìú Laplace Transform of a Piecewise Function  To find for a piecewise function:  Rewrite using unit step functions.  Combine and simplify terms so you have the fewest possible -switches.  Apply the Laplace rules ( L , L , L ) one piece at a time.     That's it. Once each term is transformed, you can add them up thanks to linearity. You'll be left with a fully transformed piecewise function living in the Laplace domain.  üìñ‚ùì Strategy for Transforming a Piecewise Function  What's Should you do First?   To take the Laplace transform of a piecewise function, you should first rewrite it in terms of unit step functions.    That's the foundation of this method! Once a piecewise function is rewritten using step functions, you can apply the shift rule to each piece.    Matching Activation Intervals to Switches   On the left are activation intervals for a piecewise function. Drag each interval to the unit step switch that activates it.

Step 2: Solve for algebraically and prepare it for inversion.  Step 3: Apply the inverse Laplace transform to recover .  The only twist is that our forcing term is now piecewise, so the process begins with a setup step of rewriting the forcing term using step functions.    A Model Problem  Let's solve this initial value problem to see the full method in action: where the forcing term switches ON for just one second:   You'll recognize the roadmap: forward transform ‚Üí solve in the Laplace domain ‚Üí inverse transform.

Step 2 ‚Äî Solving in the Laplace Domain  Factor out from the left side and divide to isolate it:   This is the Laplace-domain solution. Next, we rewrite into a form that matches the inverse Laplace table.  In general, any exponential terms in (i.e., and ) will return to the original domain as unit step functions using L . Therefore, you should prioritize collecting exponentials whenever you see them. For our equation, this looks like:   üìñ‚ùì Matching Exponential Factors   What do exponential terms in the Laplace domain, like , correspond to in the original-domain solution, ?

This strategy allows you to use a single formula for the entire function and apply Laplace transforms systematically.     Multiple-Choice  Choosing the Right Switch   Suppose a function is ON for . Which expression correctly switches it ON at that point?       This turns OFF at , which is the opposite of what we want.       That's right, flips ON at and stays ON from there.       Close! This is also correct, but we prefer to write it as for clarity in this context.       This turns ON from to , then OFF. Not what we want here.      Unit Step Behavior   What is the only possible set of values that any unit step function can take?     {1 only}  Unit step functions are OFF before , so they can also be 0.    {0, 1}  Correct! Unit step functions are always either 0 (OFF) or 1 (ON).    {any real number}  No, unit step functions are discrete switches, not continuous functions.    {any nonnegative number}  Even though the values are nonnegative, only 0 and 1 are ever used.     Rewriting an ON Interval   Which expression represents a function that is ON from to and OFF otherwise?      This expression turns ON at and back OFF at .     This stays ON after , but never switches OFF at .     This is ON before , but never turns ON at .     That would actually be negative during the interval from to , not what we want.     Multiplying by a Step Function   What is the effect of multiplying a function by ?     It shifts 6 units to the left.  Shifting the input would require , not multiplication by .    It keeps OFF before and turns it ON at .  Correct. acts as a switch that activates at .    It subtracts 6 from the output of .  Step functions don't affect the output directly, they control when the function is active.    It delays by 6 units.  Delaying would require rewriting the input as , not just multiplying by .

We separate the exponentials:   Let the rational part be: Then:   This means the inverse will take the form: but we must first identify using partial fractions. The details are shown below:  Partial Fraction Decomposition of  Write: Multiply by and group: Match coefficients:          So:     This completes Step 3. We'll now apply the inverse transform.   Step 4: Invert to Recover  We now compute: By rule , this gives: where:   Substitute:   This is the complete solution for all .       where     Step 1 ‚Äî Into the Laplace Domain  Recall that our first step is to apply the Laplace transform of both sides:   It's clear how to handle the left-side, but the right-side requires the transform of a piecewise function. Before we can use the rules we derived in this chapter, we first need to write in unit step form.  Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation:   The forcing function is active only from to , so we rewrite it using a unit step window:   Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the DE: On the left-hand side, using , we have:   On the right-hand side, distribute the Laplace transform: Use the shift rule for each term: Now apply linearity and known transforms: So:   Combining both sides, we arrive at the Laplace equation: This completes Step 1.  Now that we've built the Laplace equation, the remaining steps are familiar. We'll solve for , simplify, and invert. But there's one twist: the presence of terms means we'll need special care when taking the inverse Laplace transform. Let's explore that next.    Step 2 ‚Äî Solving in the Laplace Domain    Step 3 ‚Äî Leaving the Laplace Domain  Once we've solved for in the Laplace domain, the final challenge is to take the inverse Laplace transform. When the forcing function was continuous, this step relied on partial fractions and matching terms from the Laplace table. That still works here, but now we'll also see terms involving exponentials like .  These exponentials come directly from transforming unit step expressions. To move back to the -domain, we need a new tool: a rule that undoes the exponential shift.       where    Roadmap-Summary               2Ô∏è‚É£ Solve for                 3Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare for               Preparation ‚Äî Forcing Function in Step Form  We begin by rewriting with unit step functions.

Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the differential equation:   The forcing function is active only from to , so we rewrite it using a unit step window:   Apply the Laplace transform to both sides of the DE: On the left-hand side, using , we have:   On the right-hand side, distribute the Laplace transform: Use the shift rule for each term: Now apply linearity and known transforms: So:   Combining both sides, we arrive at the Laplace equation: This completes Step 1.

  "title": "Introducing Systems of Differential Equations",
  "body": " Introducing Systems of Differential Equations   When we first started studying differential equations, we focused on one equation and one dependent variable . But the real world is rarely that simple. Populations of predators and prey change together, chemical reactions involve several substances interacting, and mechanical systems often involve multiple moving parts.  In this chapter, we'll explore what happens when more than one quantity is changing at once ‚Äî and how we can describe that with systems of differential equations .    What Are Systems?  A system of differential equations is exactly what it sounds like: a collection of differential equations that must be solved together . Instead of tracking a single unknown function, we track several unknowns ‚Äî and they may influence each other.  For example, consider two unknown functions, and , governed by:   Here and describe how each quantity changes over time ‚Äî possibly depending on the other quantity. This setup is common in science and engineering because many real-world situations involve several connected variables evolving at the same time.   How Are They Different?  Unlike single equations, systems can include interaction . One variable might depend on another ‚Äî or they might depend on each other. This can produce richer behaviors like oscillations, balance points, or feedback loops. Solving systems sometimes calls for new tools, like matrix methods, but the ideas will still build on what you already know.  For example, here are some linear systems that have varying levels of dependency between the equations.                         The uncoupled system is no more than two independent differential equations that you have solved before. Far more interesting are the coupled systems, where changes in one variable directly influence changes in the other.     Uncoupled Systems  Let's start simple. Suppose we have two unknowns, and , but they don't influence each other:   These are called uncoupled because the -equation has no and the -equation has no . There's no interaction ‚Äî they're basically two separate problems packaged together.   üìñ‚ùì Example of an Uncoupled System   Solve the uncoupled system:     Each equation can be solved on its own:   Even though they evolve separately, we think of the combined solution as a pair :   You might imagine describing a cup of coffee cooling while describes a soda warming up ‚Äî two unrelated processes happening side by side.

  "body": " Interactions Between Variables   In the last section, we saw uncoupled systems , where each equation evolved completely on its own. But many real-world systems aren't so tidy. Often one quantity affects another ‚Äî or they push on each other in both directions.  In this section, we'll step up the complexity: first looking at systems where one variable drives another, and then meeting the case where both variables interact fully.       Partially Coupled Systems  Suppose we have two variables, and , but this time depends on . In other words, evolves independently, while  listens to .  Here's an example:   Notice what's happening: follows a simple exponential decay. Meanwhile, is influenced by two things ‚Äî its own decay and whatever value has at the time. This is called a partially coupled system: one-way interaction.   Solving a Partially Coupled System   Solve the system:      Step 1: Solve the independent equation for . This is a familiar exponential decay:    Step 2: Substitute into the -equation:   This is a linear first-order equation. Use an integrating factor to solve:   Multiply by and rewrite the left side as a derivative:   Integrate:   Solve for :   Use the initial condition :   So the solution is:    decays smoothly, while rises briefly (pulled by ) before eventually decaying as well. This one-way influence is the hallmark of a partially coupled system.     üìñ‚ùì Partially Coupled Equations   üìñ‚ùì Partial Coupling is One-Way   In a partially coupled system, one variable affects the other, but not vice versa.    Exactly. In these systems, one equation is independent and can be solved first. The second equation depends on the first.     üìñ‚ùì Which Should You Solve First?

Solve the independent equation for first, then use that in the equation for .    Neither equation can be solved until both are known.  Actually, this is a one-way system, drives , not the other way around.           Fully Coupled Systems (Conceptual)  We've seen systems where nothing interacts (uncoupled) and where one quantity drives another (partially coupled). Now we reach the most intricate case: fully coupled systems .  In a fully coupled system, both variables affect each other. Neither equation stands alone ‚Äî any change in alters 's future, and feeds back into .  Consider:   Here, and are fully entangled ‚Äî you can't solve one without the other. Instead of peeling off one equation at a time, we'll eventually treat the system as a single object.   üìñ‚ùì What Makes It Fully Coupled ?   What must be true for a system to be fully coupled?     Both equations involve both variables.    Each equation has only one variable.  That would actually make the system uncoupled.    One equation is independent, and the other depends on it.  That's partially coupled, not fully coupled.       üì§ Wrap-Up    üóùÔ∏è Key Takeaways..   In a partially coupled system, one equation is independent and the other depends on it.  You can solve these without any new ideas by solving independent equation first, then substitute its solution into the dependent equation.

Euler's Formula   For any real number , we have   where is the imaginary unit, defined as .  As a result of this formula, we also have       Subscript Notation  We usually use parentheses to indicate a function, as we see in the examples below: Recall that we can use that rule on things other than just For example,   Subscript notation   Subscript notation is just an alternate notation we use for functions when the input values (i.e. the domain ) consists of numbers like Here's an example of subscript notation:  Suppose   Notice that this is much like the function except we would never evaluate this function at (because -1.3 is negative and is not an integer).  We can evaluate this function at any nonnegative integer, though, as below:     Given the definition of a function in subscript notation, find the value of the given term.   If evaluate       If evaluate             If evaluate                Function Notation  Function notation is a cornerstone of mathematics and science because it allows us to describe relationships between variables in a compact and precise way. While seemingly simple, its power lies in its flexibility and depth. If you've studied calculus, you're familiar with the concept of a function, but reviewing its nuances can help unlock a deeper understanding of differential equations and mathematical modeling.  A function, in essence, is a rule that assigns to each input value exactly one output value. For example, the function takes any input , squares it, and returns the result. The notation doesn't just give the value of the function for a specific ; it also reminds us of the relationship between the input and output.  In the context of differential equations, function notation often appears alongside derivatives, such as or . These expressions indicate the rate of change of a function and are critical for describing real-world phenomena like motion, population growth, or heat transfer.  Simple Function Example  Suppose . What is ?  To evaluate, substitute into the function: This tells us that when the input is 4, the output of the function is 11.   Function notation also allows us to describe more complex relationships. For instance, in the differential equation , we use functions and to represent how the rate of change of depends separately on and . Each function is flexible enough to represent anything from a simple polynomial to a more intricate expression involving trigonometric or exponential terms.  Function Composition and Relationships  Consider two functions: and . The composition of these functions, written as , represents the output of when is used as its input. That is: This compact notation conveys a lot of information and is frequently used in modeling.   Function notation is especially powerful when combined with initial conditions in differential equations. For example, if we know that and , we can interpret as a function that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial condition. Here, tells us that when , the output of the function is 5.  Function Notation in Initial Value Problems  Solve the initial value problem:   Start by finding the general solution: Then, use the initial condition to determine : Thus, the particular solution is:    To summarize, function notation is not just a way to write formulas, it is a powerful language for describing relationships, modeling systems, and solving problems. Mastering function notation ensures a smoother understanding of differential equations and opens the door to a deeper appreciation of how mathematics connects to the real world.  Function notation is a critical tool in mathematics, especially when working with differential equations. It allows us to concisely express relationships between variables, their rates of change, and how these relationships evolve over time or in different contexts. However, interpreting function notation requires careful attention to what each part of the equation represents.  Consider the following equation: At first glance, this equation may seem intimidating, but it is simply a mathematical way to describe how a function behaves. Let's break it down piece by piece.   Key Components of Function Notation  1. The Function : In this equation, is a function of , meaning its value depends on the variable . For instance, might represent a population at time , the temperature at a certain moment, or the position of an object.  2. Derivatives : The term represents the th derivative of with respect to . Derivatives measure how changes as changes. For example:  is the first derivative and represents the rate of change of .  is the second derivative and measures how the rate of change itself is changing.    3. Coefficients and Functions : The terms and are functions of . They act as \"modifiers\" that influence the behavior of . For example:  scales by a factor that depends on .  represents an external input or forcing term that drives the system.  These terms make the equation more flexible and realistic for modeling real-world systems.    Interpreting an Equation  To better understand function notation, let's examine an example: This is a second-order differential equation where:  is the second derivative of , representing acceleration or curvature in the system.  adds a damping term proportional to the first derivative (rate of change).  scales the function by a constant factor.  is an external input that decays over time, influencing .  Together, these terms describe a system whose behavior depends on how and its derivatives interact with both internal factors (like ) and external forces ( ).  When you encounter equations like this, focus on identifying the structure:  What is the highest-order derivative? This tells you the order of the equation.  Are there any coefficients (like or ) or functions (like ) that modify the behavior of ?  Is there an external forcing term (e.g., ) driving the system?  By answering these questions, you can build an intuition for how the equation models a real-world phenomenon.    Breaking Down an Equation  Let's analyze: This is a first-order differential equation where:  represents how changes with respect to .  is a coefficient that depends on , scaling .  The product shows that the rate of change of depends on both and the current value of .  This form is separable, as we can rewrite it as: Recognizing this structure helps us know how to approach solving the equation.   Understanding function notation is key to reading, interpreting, and solving differential equations. By breaking down each term and identifying its role, you can gain a clear picture of how an equation models a system's behavior. Whether you're dealing with a simple equation like or a complex one like , function notation provides a powerful framework for understanding and solving mathematical problems.   Solving Polynomial Equations  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  ‚ú≥Ô∏è Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so Therefore,    Possible Rational Roots  There is a theorem that tells us potential fractional roots of the polynomial. If is a solution, then must be of the form . This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.        Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.  By combining these techniques, we can solve for the roots of any higher-degree polynomial. Once we have the roots, we can construct the general solution to the higher-order LHCC equation.  For a higher-order LHCC equation like: , the characteristic equation is the polynomial equation we just discussed. Finding the roots of this polynomial gives us the general solution: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.  Let's see an example to solidify these concepts.  Solving a Third-Degree Polynomial Equation   Find the general solution to the third-order LHCC equation:       First, write down the characteristic equation: . Factoring the polynomial, we get: . Therefore, the roots are .  Since we have three distinct real roots, the general solution to the LHCC equation is: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.    Polynomail Division  Use polynomial divison to compute                                                                                     Therefore, .    Rational Functions  Rational functions are a fundamental concept in algebra and calculus, and they play a significant role in differential equations. A rational function is defined as the ratio of two polynomials.  Rational Function  A rational function is a function that is the division of two polynomials.  For example, the following are rational functions in the variables , , and , respectively: .    Partial Fraction Decomposition  Partial fraction decomposition is a method used to express a rational function as a sum of simpler fractions. This process is especially useful when solving integrals and applying inverse Laplace transforms. The following steps outline the process to find the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function.   Check the Degree of the Numerator and Denominator  Ensure the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator. If the numerator has a degree greater than or equal to the denominator, first perform polynomial long division to reduce the degree of the numerator.   Factor the Denominator  Factor the denominator into irreducible linear or quadratic factors.   Linear factors: Expressions of the form .   Irreducible quadratic factors: Expressions of the form where the discriminant is negative.     Set up the Partial Fraction Decomposition  Based on the factors of the denominator, write the decomposition:  For each linear factor , include a term of the form .  For repeated linear factors , include terms like:   For irreducible quadratic factors , include a term of the form .  For repeated quadratic factors , include terms like:      Solve for the Constants  Multiply both sides of the equation by the common denominator and expand to eliminate fractions. Group terms by powers of and set up a system of equations to solve for the unknown constants , , and .   Final Result  Once the constants are found, write the final partial fraction decomposition. This decomposition can now be used for further calculations such as integrals or inverse Laplace transforms.    ‚ú≥Ô∏è Reference: Partial Fraction General Form Terms  For each type of factor in the denominator, add the following terms to the partial fraction decomposition:    Factor Type  Factor  Term(s) In General Form    Linear      Repeated Linear      Irreducible Quadratic      Repeated Quadratic        Find the partial fraction decomposition form for each.

For example, we might consider the vibration of an airplane wing that is struck by some external object or a circuit that is initially open and then we close the circuit and the current immediately starts flowing. Both of these scenarios would require a piecewise defined function because there is a moment in time when something about the physical system changes.  As such, we need to remember how piecewise defined functions work. Consider the function   If we want to evaluate the function at a particular -value, we use the restrictions on the right to point us to which piece of the function definition we should use. For example, if we want to know , then we look over at that right side and see that 3 falls into the interval so we use the corresponding function, . Thus,   If we want to graph, we also use those restrictions. When , or equivalently when is in the interval we know that the graph of will look like the horizontal line ; on the interval the graph will look like the graph of the parabola ; etc.  In the plots below you can see the entire graphs of the functions, dotted, with a solid segment that will be part of the piecewise function .          Now we are prepared to assemble the pieces and generate the graph of the piecewise-defined function .                     If you'd like more of a review feel free to look at VMI's precalculus text, here   Now you try some.   Sketch each of the following piecewise defined functions.                                     Recursive functions  We often use subscript notation when the function is a recursive function, where we rely on knowing previous values in order to compute the next value, as in the example below. Example: Suppose and   [(a)] Find the value of  Answer: One way to read this definition is: ``To get the next value of --the value at we take 3 times the previous value of --the value at --and then add two. In this example, we know the value of at because we are given that Then we can find the next value of --the value at --as follows:    [(b)] Find the value of  Answer: If we use the formula above, with then we have It looks like we actually need to know the value of ...and it turns out that in order to know the value of we actually need to know the value of ...which requires that we know the value of --which we already found. So here goes:   The bottom line with recursive functions is that if we know we can find and then we can find and so on. But if we want to know for example, we need to know ALL of the previous -values . Side note: You may recall some of this from studying sequences and series in calculus. In calculus we sometimes looked for a pattern so we could avoid having to compute all previous values. That's a great skill, and it might even work for the examples below, but we won't generally be able to do that in differential equations.   Now you try:   Given the definition of a recursive function in subscript notation, find the value of the given term.   If and evaluate             If and evaluate             If and evaluate                Interrelated functions  In differential equations, we will encounter functions involving subscripts that are interrelated. Let's look at an example like that. Example: Suppose: Find the values of and  First we would try to find Notice that when we use the formula, we have While we do have the values of and we don't yet have the value of So we'll find that first: Now we have all the information we need to find  Now we proceed in the same manner. First we find  Then we find     Find given the following information about and              Find given the following information about and              Find given the following information about and                Units, Mass, Volume, Concentration  We're about to start working on applications involving mixing solutions in tanks. That means we need to be mindful of units (for example--we can't add miles and kilograms), mass balance, and volumes. We also can develop some intuition that will be helpful when we tackle more complicated questions.   Consider the equation where is a speed and has units of miles\/hour. The variable represents distance and has units miles. What units must the variable have?   In order to make the unit analysis work, we would need to have units of hours .    hours     Consider the equation where has units of moles\/hour and has units of gallons\/hour. What must the units of be?   In order to make the unit analysis work, we would need to have units of moles\/gallon .    moles\/gallon     Consider the equation where has units of ft lb\/sec, has units of ft, has units of lb\/sec. What must the units of be?   In order to make the unit analysis work, we would need to have units of ft lb\/sec .    ft lb\/sec     Consider the tank below, which has salt water solutions (also called brines) entering via two input lines (A and B) and has one output line (C).       If the tank level does not change, what volumetric flow rate must be leaving via the output line C?   Brine is entering the tank at volumetric flow rate Since the tank level does not change, brine must leave at the same rate, 14 L\/min .    14 L\/min     The concentration (in kg\/L) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the figure. At what rate (in kg\/min) is salt entering the tank?   Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of 64 kg\/min .    64 kg\/min     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via two input lines (A and B) and has one output line (C).       If the tank level does not change, what volumetric flow rate must be entering via the input line B?   Brine is leaving the tank at volumetric flow rate 10 gal\/sec. Inlet A contributes 4 gal\/sec, which means that if the tank level is to remain constant, inlet B must contribute 6 gal\/sec .    6 gal\/sec     The concentration (in lb\/gal) of salt in each brine solution is shown in the figure. Assuming the tank level doesn't change, at what rate (in lb\/sec) is salt entering the tank?   Salt is entering the tank via inlet A at a rate Similarly, salt enters via inlet B at a rate Altogether, then, salt enters at a rate of 26 lb\/sec .    26 lb\/sec     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via two input lines (A and B) and has one output line (C).       What happens to the level of the tank over time? Be specific.   Liquid is entering at a rate of 7+10 = 17 L\/min. It leaves at a rate of 12 L\/min. That means that the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a rate of 5 L\/min.    increases (volume increases at a rate of 5 L\/min)     If the tank has a capacity of 1500 L, and is empty at time minutes, write a function for volume of liquid in the tank at time minutes.   Since the amount of liquid in the tank increases at a rate of 5 L\/min, we have Since the capacity of the tank is 1500 L, this equation only works for minutes.          Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via one input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).       Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of water that is dark red due to food coloring and that the liquid entering the tank is pure water. Imagine that we allow the pure water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What color would you expect the water in the tank to be after a really long time?   Over time we would expect that the water in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the tank be clear (i.e., pure water).    clear (i.e., pure water)     Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of pure water and that the liquid entering the tank is water that is dark red due to food coloring. Imagine that we allow the dark red water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What color would you expect the water in the tank to be after a really long time?   Over time we would expect that the water in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the tank to have dark red water--the same as the incoming water.    dark red (same as incoming water)     Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via an input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).   Suppose the tank initially contains 50 gallons of a salt water solution (also called a brine) with concentration 6 lb\/gal, and that the liquid entering the tank is pure water.    How much salt is initially in the tank?   Initially we have     300 lb     Imagine that we allow the pure water to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What concentration of salt do you expect there to be in the tank after a long time?   Initially we have salt in the tank, but over time, no salt is added but the solution is drained, so more and more salt leaves the tank. Over time we would expect that the concentration of salt would decrease to 0 lb\/gal .    0 lb\/gal     How much salt do you expect to be in the tank after a long time? (Note that this is a slightly different question than the previous question.)    Consider the tank below, which has liquid entering via one input line (A) and is drained via one output line (B).   Suppose the tank initially contains 50 L of a brine with concentration 6 kg\/L, and that the liquid entering the tank is a brine with concentration 8 kg\/L.    Imagine that we allow the brine to enter the tank and the mixed solution to drain out of the tank for a really long time; you can think about it happening for years, if it helps. What concentration of salt do you expect there to be in the tank after a long time?   Over time we would expect that the fluid in the tank is almost identical to the incoming fluid. Therefore, we expect the concentration of salt to be 8 kg\/L .    8 kg\/L     How much salt do you expect to be in the tank after a long time? (Note that this is a slightly different than asking about the concentration of salt. Hint: use units!)   Since we expect the concentration to be 8 kg\/L, and there are 50 L of solution in the tank (which doesn't change because the volumetric flow rate in is equal to the volumetric flow rate out), then we expect there will be     400 kg       "

You thought your Calculus 1 instructor was crazy for spending sooooooo long on limits, especially when you were convinced you would never, ever use them, and now here they are again!  In this section, we'll focus our attention on limits at infinity. If you want a refresher, check out your Calculus 1 book (available online--just search for \"APEX calculus\".   Evaluate each of the following limits.    The limit of a constant is the constant, so          where is a constant  The limit of a constant is the constant, so            As increases to large positive values, the value of also increases to large positive values. Therefore            As increases to large positive values, the value of also increases to large positive values. Therefore            As increases to large positive values, the value of decreases to zero. Therefore             For what values of is the limit finite?  Hopefully you thought a little bit about this as you answered the previous question. If you think about it for a little bit, you'll come to realize that:  If then so .

L'Hospital's Rule  Consider the following three limits. Typically when we evaluate limits, we first attempt a direct substitution. Note that all three evaluate to the indeterminant form . Since these are all rational functions, we have some algebraic techniques we can try. Here's one way each can be evaluated.  Is this result surprising to you? Each had the same value, , when we did direct substitution, but each has a different final answer. That's what it means to be indeterminant. we can't tell what the answer is just based on knowing that direct substitution yields .  We can do algebra when we have rational functions, but that doesn't work as well when we have exponential and trig functions. One technique you might consider using when you have indeterminant forms like or is L'Hospital's Rule. Here's a reminder.   L'Hospital's Rule. Suppose and are differentiable functions and we want to evaluate If direct substitution yields an indeterminant form or then assuming that the limit exists.    Here's how it works for one of the limits above. Recall that we MUST check to make sure that the limit is one of those indeterminant forms before we use L'Hospital's Rule. (And note that we did get the same answer we got before...which is good!)  If you want a more complete discussion and some examples, you can find more in your Calculus 1 book, which is available for free online (just search for \"APEX calculus\").   Evaluate each of the following limits. Use L'Hospital's Rule only if it applies.                                           where is a constant and                 Differentiation  Throughout the DEs course, we will be differentiating AND integrating. Let's review a few common rules used for differentiation.  Product Rule:    Quotient Rule:    Chain Rule:     Consider the following example.   Find the derivative of  We have a product of functions, so we will need to use the product rule. We also have a composition of functions because is inside of an sine function, so we will need to use the chain rule. Here's how it works.    Now you try.   Find the indicated derivatives.       Solution                                      Product Rule  The next technique for solving DEs we will study relies heavily on you knowing the Product Rule for differentiation inside and out, forward and backward (literally!). These problems are intended to help you review the Product Rule. (Don't forget about the chain rule, too!) Let's warm up by practicing using the product rule.   Write down the product rule.   Evaluate the following derivatives.                                          Suppose is a function of and use the product rule to rewrite the following:            Suppose is a function of and use the product rule to rewrite the following:            Now let's look at the product rule \"in the other direction\"... Or we can think about this as \"un-doing\" the product rule.  For example, if we have the expression then we can see that if we think identify as then Then we might label the expression as follows: This now looks like the result of having taken the derivative of a product. That is:   Now you try some.  Rewrite each of the following as the derivative of a product:                             Compute the derivative of the function           -substitution  When an antiderivative is not immediately obvious, we sometimes use a substitution. Substitution is a good choice when we have one part of the integrand \"looks like\" the derivative of another part of the integrand.  Here, \"looks like\" means equal, except for a multiplication of a constant. For example, we might say   \"looks like\" or  \"looks like\"     Let's look a a few examples   Compute  Since the derivative of is which \"looks like\" , then -substitution (with ) works well. Note, would also work.               Compute  Substitution is a good choice here because we have a natural log function and we have which is the derivative of natural log. So we would choose          We usually pause to confirm that the new integral is simpler than the original. In this case it certainly is, so we proceed to integrate and then change back to the original variable, .   Now you try some.  Evaluate each of the following integrals. Use proper notation.     We will choose Then Therefore we have:            We will choose Then and therefore Thus we have:            We will choose Then and therefore Thus we have:             Integration by parts  Integration by parts may be a good choice when the integrand contains a product. Recall the formula for integration by parts.   Let's consider the following example.  Evaluate  We choose and as follows: Then we find by taking the derivative of and by taking the antiderivative of : Thus we have:    Now you try some.   Evaluate each of the following integrals. Use proper notation.      We choose and as follows: Then we find by taking the derivative of and by taking the antiderivative of : Thus we have:           We choose and as follows: Then we find by taking the derivative of and by taking the antiderivative of : Thus we have: The remaining integral, is simpler than the one we started with, but we will need to do another integration by parts in order to evaluate it. Here we choose Then we find by taking the derivative of and by taking the antiderivative of : Now we pick up where we left off:          Integration by parts is a technique for transforming integrals in a way that makes them easier to solve. A good way to think about it is like redistributing \"work\" between two functions. One function takes on the derivative, while the other gets simplified through integration.  Imagine you have two workers. One is skilled at hard, repetitive tasks (like differentiating), and the other is better at creative problem-solving (like integrating). Integration by parts is like swapping their roles so that the right person handles the right task.   Breaking Down the Integration by Parts Formula  Let's break down the formula for integration by parts: .  Here's how it works:   is a function that you choose to differentiate (it should get simpler when differentiated).  is a part of the integrand that you choose to integrate (it should get easier when integrated).  is the new term after applying the product of and the integral of .  is the remaining integral, now simpler than the original.     Example: Applying Integration by Parts  Consider the integral: .  We'll apply integration by parts, following these steps:    Step 1:  Identify and . In this case, we choose and . This makes and .    Step 2:  Step 2: Substitute into the integration by parts formula: .    Step 3:  Step 3: Solve the remaining integral: .    Step 4:  Step 4: Combine the results: .    And that's the final result: .    Laplace Transform and Integration by Parts: An Analogy  When applying the Laplace Transform, think of it as a way of \"unwrapping\" the derivatives of a function. Just like how you can redistribute \"work\" between functions using integration by parts, the Laplace Transform temporarily converts a differential equation into an algebraic one, allowing you to solve it more easily.  Once the problem is solved in the transformed space, we can \"repackage\" the function by applying the inverse Laplace Transform, revealing the solution in its original form.     Improper Integrals  There are two types of improper integrals; the only type we'll be looking at in differential equations are the type where the upper limit of the integral is infinity. When we see improper integrals, we re-write the integral as a limit as follows. We don't have to use for the placeholder in the limit, but we shouldn't use any of the variables that is already in the integrand; in the above, we should not use or . Once we've written the improper integral as a limit, we integrate and use the fundamental theorem of calculus, keeping the limit as we go, and we evaluate the limit at the very end. Here's an example.   Compute      If you want more of a refresher, check out your Calculus 2 book (available online-- just search for \"APEX calculus\").   Evaluate the following integrals. Use proper limit notation.                 , where is a constant and                "

The general form of an LHCC equation is: .     The Characteristic Equation   By assuming a solution of the form , an LHCC can be reduced to a characteristic polynomial in .  The solutions to the characteristic equation determine the form of the general solution.     Solution Types   Let be a solution to the characteristic equation (CE).

Substituting transforms the differential equation into an algebraic equation for .  The characteristic equation is a polynomial equation whose roots determine the fundamental solutions.  An n -th order LHCC equation always has n solutions, corresponding to the n roots of its characteristic equation.  Each real root leads to a solution of the form .   In the next subsection, we will explore how to construct the general solution by combining these exponential solutions appropriately.  The key ideas are:   The superposition principle allows us to sum independent solutions to form the general solution.  The number of fundamental solutions matches the order of the differential equation.  The general solution consists of all fundamental solutions, each multiplied by an arbitrary constant.   ‚ú≥Ô∏è Properties of LHCC Solutions  The solutions to any -th order linear homogeneous differential equation, have the following properties:    ‚úèÔ∏è    Exponential Solutions .

The solutions to an -th order LHCC equation are linearly independent, meaning no two solutions can be combined into a single term.     ‚úèÔ∏è    General Solution . Let be the linearly independent exponential solutions, then the general solution is formed by for any constants .      ‚ú≥Ô∏è Key Takeaways    If and are solutions to an LHCC equation, then is also a solution for any constants and .  The general solution to an LHCC equation consists of a linear combination of all its independent solutions.  The number of independent solutions corresponds to the order of the equation.  An LHCC equation often has multiple exponential solutions, determined by solving the characteristic equation.  The principle of superposition states that any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution.  The general solution is formed by summing all independent exponential solutions with arbitrary coefficients.  The solutions to LHCC equations are exponential functions because their derivatives preserve the same functional form.  The concept of like-terms helps explain why other function types (polynomials, trigonometric functions) do not work.  By substituting an exponential into the equation, we obtain a polynomial equation for , which determines the general solution.     In this subsection, we developed a framework for solving Linear Homogeneous Constant Coefficient (LHCC) equations . We began by exploring why exponential functions serve as the fundamental solutions to these equations, using the concept of like-terms to justify their role.  We then introduced the characteristic equation , which transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into solving a polynomial equation. This method allows us to systematically determine the correct set of fundamental solutions for any LHCC equation.  With this foundation in place, we are now ready to introduce a powerful tool for systematically finding these solutions: the characteristic equation . This algebraic approach allows us to determine the exponential solutions efficiently and will serve as the backbone of our solution methods moving forward.  To build intuition, we will carefully examine the three defining properties of LHCC equations: linearity , homogeneity , and constant coefficients . Each of these characteristics influences the types of solutions that emerge and dictates the methods we use to solve them. By clearly defining and identifying LHCC equations, we lay the groundwork for developing powerful solution techniques in the sections that follow.  Unlike many other types of differential equations, LHCC equations have a highly structured solution method. Their solutions take on a predictable form, allowing us to develop a systematic approach for solving them. Through examples and analysis, we will discover that exponential functions play a central role in solving LHCC equations.

The general solution consists of all independent exponential solutions, each multiplied by an arbitrary constant.  The number of solutions matches the order of the differential equation.   In summary, a differential equation is classified as an LHCC equation if it satisfies three criteria:   It is linear : each term involves or its derivatives to the first power only.  It is homogeneous : the right-hand side is zero.  It has constant coefficients : the coefficients of and its derivatives do not depend on .    Undermined Coefficients  Key Terms & Concepts   ‚ú≥Ô∏è Summary of the Key Ideas    The method of undetermined coefficients is used to solve non-homogeneous linear differential equations.  The general solution to a non-homogeneous equation is the sum of the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution.

Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation involves transforming each term by multiplying by and integrating with respect to from to , but is often simplified by directly applying the Laplace operator, .   Linearity Property . The Laplace transform is linear, meaning it distributes across addition and subtraction, and allows for constants to be factored out. This property is essential for transforming complex equations.   Transforming Initial Conditions .

The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:   ‚ú≥Ô∏è Summary of the Key Ideas   Laplace Transform Method    Common Forms: A table of common Laplace transforms is provided, which doubles as a reference for inverse transforms. The focus is on recognizing forms that match the table entries for functions like , and others.   Direct Computation: When the function of directly matches a form in the common Laplace transform table, the inverse Laplace transform can be easily computed.   Modifying Functions: When a function doesn't match a known form, minor modifications, such as multiplying by missing constants or splitting fractions, can help.   Completing the Square: When dealing with quadratic expressions in the denominator, especially when the discriminant is negative, completing the square can transform the expression into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms. Several examples demonstrate this technique.   Partial Fraction Decomposition: For more complex rational functions, partial fraction decomposition breaks down the function into simpler fractions that match the common transform forms.

However, it's not the only strategy available. In this section, we'll explore another important technique: partial fraction decomposition. This method is useful for breaking down complex fractions into simpler components that can each be matched with forms in the Laplace transform table.  Two other forms we may wish to match when we study Laplace transforms are As before, we work toward making the denominator match first , and then we sort out the numerator second.  When we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function with a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, we may complete the square or we may do a partial fraction decomposition. How will we know which is appropriate? Here are a few guidelines for you to consider.  Does the denominator factor in an obvious way? If so, factor the denominator and do a partial fraction decomposition if necessary.  If the denominator does not factor in an obvious way, try completing the square.  If you end up with addition outside of the parentheses, as in then you should aim to match and\/or .  If instead you end up with subtraction outside the parentheses, as in then you should factor and do a partial fraction decomposition. You may consider using the quadratic formula if the factorization is not obvious to you.  If you end up with no terms outside the parentheses, as in then use .
