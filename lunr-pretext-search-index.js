  "body": "An Analogy  When leanring a new concept, it is typically a good strategy to build off of things that you already know. To understand what a differential equation is, it makes sense to see how it differs from stadard equations that you are familiar with. For example, suppose we wanted to solve for in the following three equations   All three are equations, but only the third equation is a differential equation since it contains a derivative, . Nevertheless, each of these equations seek to solve for by isolating it on one side of the equation. Let's look at what happens in each case.           The solutions to first and second equations were found, but the third equation does not yet have a solution since we only isolated , not . Later, we will explore how to remove this derivative, leaving us with just . Also, notice that the solution to the first equation is a number, while the solution to the second equation is a function of . The solution to a differential equation will always be a function.

  "body": "What is a Solution?  Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that satisfies the equation. The term satisfies simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true. This undeniably true statement is sometimes called an identity. For example, suppose I want to check if and are solutions to the equation . To do this, we verify that both and  satisfy the equation by separately plugging and in for each , simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so        Since yields an undeniably true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution.

This means that the solutions to both equations are the same and you are free to use either form when verifying solutions. For a beginner, it is often easier to verify solutions using the second form, as it is easier to see if the left-side of the equation simplifies to zero.   TIP: Move Terms to the Left-Side before Verifying   Before verifying solutions, move all terms to the left-side of the equation using subtraction. This makes the right-side zero, simplifying the process.

  "body": "Particular Solutions  When you solve a differential equation, you're actually computing the general solution, which means you have a variety of possible solutions (a family) that differ by at least one constant. However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.  Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the -plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.  Suppose we want the solution to the differential equation . Etcept for the initial condition, this is the same equation we solved in the previous section, which has the general solution . The initial condition, , tells us that \" must equal 2 when is 0\". When we substitute and into , we see that we can solve for .     Therefore, forces and we get the particular solution . In can see the initial condition, , as the point on the -axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.    In the graph, the point on the -axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the -axis.  As you drag the point, make the following observations:   Each new value of gives a new value of , which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve).  Only one particular solution from the family of solutions (green curves) passes through the initial condition.       The family of solutions (green curves) and a particular solution (blue curve) passing through .    Check your Understanding  Is it an IVP? The differential equation, is not an initial value problem because it does not include a value of at some value. In contrast, the differential equation, is an initial value problem because it includes the initial value .  What are the dependent and independent variable in this case? In practice, differential equations are often paired with some information about the solution itself. For example, suppose we want to come up with a differential equation that predicts the spread of a disease in some community. The solution of this DE would be a function that predicts the number of people infected (output) for some given time (input) in the future. There are two quantities at play here: the number infected = , and time = . For this discussion, let's assume time is in days. Since the number of infected, , changes according to how much time, , has passed, then depends on . Therefore, would the dependent variable and would be the independent variable. Note, we don't know anything about the differential equation, but we know the solution will be . Once this solution is known, we can use it to predict the number infected at a future time. Now, let's say we have the solution, , plug into it, and see the following: This result would be interpreted as \"after 10 days, we predict 30 people will be infected\". Remember, we don't know the differential equation nor the solution, but based on the situation, we should know some information.  What is one value for the number of infected we should know? Since we can count the number currently infected, we should know the exact number of people initially infected. So we should get this initial value when we plug time = 0 into our solution. For the ease of discussion, let's say the initial number of infected was 12. This means we know . Any information about the initial value of a dependent variable is referred to as an initial condition.    Referring to the 2nd bullet point above, if you use initial conditions to find the constants of the general solution, then we can reasonably state that  Initial conditions find a from the general solution (or family of solutions).    particular solution   "

  "body": "Summary & Exercises   Solving Initial Value Problems  For most of the techniques in this book, solving an initial value problem requires two main steps:  Solve for the general solution (with constants).  Compute the constants in the general solution using the initial conditions.     In this section and in the exercises that follow, we will be only concerned with step 2. So don't worry if you do not understand where these general solutions come from. In chapter 2, we will look at our first technique for solving a differential equation.   Summary of the Key Ideas      Solution of a Differential Equation         Verifying a function is a Solution         Types of Solutions         Initial Conditions           To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points of the previous section that will be useful in this section.  The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.  All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of possible solutions we called a family of solutions.  Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.     Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is equal to the order of the differential equation .  This is illustrated in ? since is of 2nd order and the general solution, , has 2 constants, and .     There are some exceptions when working with nonlinear DEs.     Discuss the difference between a general solution, family of solutions, and a particualr solution.  Given the differential equation determine if the following functions are solutions of this differential equation.    a.   b.   c.     d.   e.   f.     g.   h.   i.        a. No  b. Yes  c. Yes    d.

Yes      Match each function on the left with a DE on the right if this function is a solution (i.e. is in the family of solutions) for this DE.

Find the value of the constant in order for the differential equation to have the solution .    Is a solution of the differential equation  Yes  Find the value of    For each of the differential equations and function pairs, find all the possible values of such that the function is a solution to the DE.                      Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the general solution of a differential equation.  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution.  Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   Does an initial condition always give you a particular solution?  When there is one constant in the general solution, yes.  When there is more than one constant in the general solution, no.  It does, however, limit the possible values of the constants.   Consider the differential equation   Verify that the family of functions a solution to this differential equation.  Find the particular solution that corresponds to the initial condition .    Yes   , so is the particular solution   Consider the differential equation Which of the following is a family of solutions for this DE?        Find the particular solution such that .  b.   , so is the particular solution   Try first.  Compute       So for this function, it is not the solution.  Now try . Then   while   So this function is the solution  Setting we get   Solve for c,  So the solution for the IVP is   Understanding what it means to Solve a DE   We spend a lot of time solving equations, but do you even remember what it means to be a solution? Let's review what it means to be a solution to an algebraic equation (as in question ), and then what it means to be a solution to a differential equation (as in question ), and then we'll extend those ideas in questions and .   Verify that is a solution to the equation  What confirms that is a solution? the LHS = RHS after substituting into both sides of the equation.  ( Note: Do not rearrange the equation to solve for . That would be the process of finding a solution; you are asked to verify a solution. ) Since we get the same result (21) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the equation. We substitute into the left hand side (LHS) of the equation, and then into the right hand side (RHS) of the equation: Since we get the same result when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.  Verify that is a solution to the DE  Look back at the previous question and think about what it means to be a solution to a DE. Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the DE. We need to substitute into the DE. In order to substitute into the left hand side, we need to know the second derivative. So we begin by finding that. Now we can substitute into the DE: Since when we substitute in to the DE, we find that the LHS is equal to the RHS, we have verified that is a solution to the DE   Consider the DE  Find all values of such that is a solution to the DE by taking derivatives and substituting into the DE, and then solving for .  no matter the value of or Therefore we might want to factor it out as it won't contribute to our answer.   First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE and solve for : Recall that no matter the value of or Thus we have: So the two solutions are   Now that you have (hopefully!) two values for choose one of the two values and then verify that is a solution for that value of  Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that (or ) is a solution to the DE.  The work here is for and the work for is similar.  First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Hence, we have shown that is a solution to the DE     Assuming the form of the solution of DE.  Find all values of such that is a solution of the DE     We proceed as in the previous question. First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Note that there is no value of that can guarantee that is 0. Hence we have So the two solutions are      "

When you first learn about linearity in mathematics, it often involves functions whose graphs are straight lines. However, when we talk about the linearity of a differential equation, the concept is different and can be tricky to grasp for a beginner.  To prepare for the definition of linearity of a DE, we need the following:   Recall the difference between a dependent and independent variable. For example, is the dependent and is the independent variable in the equation .      Terms are parts in the equation that are separated by , , or signs.    A term is linear if it looks like    where is the dependent variable and is the independent variable. Here are a few examples of linear terms: . Note, the (function of ) in each term does not need to be linear, however there can be at most one dependent variable, in each term.  You have seen examples of a linear terms, but what about a nonlinear terms? The following list gives you some rules of thumb for what nonlinear terms tend to look like.

  "body": "Linearity  Now that we are familiar with linear terms, we are ready for the next definition.   A differential equation is said to be linear if it only contains linear terms. That is, it can be written as If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is nonlinear .   This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As you will see in the examples that follow, most equations that you encounter will only have a few terms.   Determine if the following differential equation is linear.  .  To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear. Let's rewrite this equation like and check each term one-by-one. Since every term is linear, this differential equation is linear.    Check your Understanding  Now you Try The differential equation, , is  Linear   Yes! This DE is linear.    Non-Linear  No, Try again.    Determine if the following differential equation is linear.   Linear  Correct! Since the term is nonlinear, the DE is nonlinear.   Non-Linear  No, Try again.     "
