To understand what a differential equation is, it makes sense to see how it differs from stadard equations that you are familiar with. For example, suppose we wanted to solve for in the following three equations           All three are equations, but only the third equation is a differential equation since it contains the derivative, . Let's try to solve for in each of these cases.           We isolated in the first two equations and in the third. Later, we will explore how to remove this derivative, leaving us with just .

Just like books in a library are organized by genre, author, or subject, we classify differential equations to understand and solve them effectively. Placing such labels on differential equations is known as classification and is crucial for selecting the most suitable methods for solving them.  One way to classify a differential equation is by the number of derivatives that are applied to the function we are solving for. Think of each derivative as a layer that we have to \"peel off\" to get to the function we want. Generally, the more derivatives there are, the more complex the solution will be.    The order of a differential equation is the highest order derivative that appears in the equation.  If the highest derivative in an equation is the first derivative, we say the differential equation is first-order . If the highest derivative is the second derivative, we say it is second-order , and so on.     Give the order of each of the differential equations     This differential equation has an order of 1 because the highest derivative in the equation is a first derivative. Therefore, it is called a \"first-order differential equation\".    This differential equation has an order of 3 because the highest derivative in the equation is a third derivative. Therefore, it is called a \"third-order differential equation\".   Note : Be careful not to confuse exponents with derivatives. The term means that the dependent variable is raised to the 8th power; this has nothing to do with the order of the differential equation.

However, the linearity of a differential equation is different and can be tricky to grasp for a beginner.  Before we begin, it will be helpful to review the following concepts:    Dependent vs. Independent variables. For example, is the dependent and is the independent variable in the equation .      Terms & Coefficients of a differential equation. See .     Since the linearity of a differential equation depends on the linearity of its terms, lets define what it means for a term to be linear.    A linear term of a differential equation is a constant term or has the form  where is the dependent variable and is the independent variable.    Linear & Nonlinear Terms   The following are examples of linear terms:  . The linearity of these terms is determined by the presence of at most one or its derivatives, while the coefficients (in blue) play no part in the linearity. In contrast, the following terms are not linear: .   The following list outlines some rules of thumb for identifying nonlinear terms.

The linearity of terms naturally leads to the general concept of linearity, and the previous section has equipped us well for this important task.   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be written as If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is nonlinear .   This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As the examples will show, most equations you encounter will only have a few terms and our approach will be to find just one of them that is not linear. If we can't, then the equation is linear.   Determine if the following differential equation is linear.  .  To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear.

The term satisfies simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true. This undeniably true statement is sometimes called an identity. For example, suppose I want to check if and are solutions to the equation . To do this, we verify that both and  satisfy the equation by separately plugging and in for each , simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so        Since yields an undeniably true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, does not give a true statement, so it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.  The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that solutions are functions instead of numbers. To see this, let's verify if and are solutions to the differential equation .  Separately plugging and into the equation yields        Since results in a false statement, it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.

This means that the solutions to both equations are the same and you are free to use either form when verifying solutions. For a beginner, it is often easier to verify solutions using the second form, as it is easier to see if the left-side of the equation simplifies to zero.   TIP: Move Terms to the Left-Side before Verifying   Before verifying solutions, move all terms to the left-side of the equation using subtraction. This makes the right-side zero, simplifying the process.     Solution Verification Steps  Verifying if a function is a solution to a differential equation involves checking if the function satisfies the equation, outlined as follows:  Move Terms   Move terms to the left-side of the equation .

You have also seen that a single differential equation can have more than one solution . However, this begs the question:   How many solutions does a differential equation have?   The answer depends on the context of the problem and is the focus of this section. To kick-off this discussion, lets start with an example.    Solution Verification with a Constant   Show that the functions  are solutions to the differential equation .

However, in real-world problems, you usually need a specific solution from this pool that fits the situation. This is where initial conditions come in.  Solving a differential equation typically starts with finding the general solution that defines an infinite pool of possible solutions (family of solutions). shows how a few of the solutions are laid out in the -plane. Initial conditions help reduce the number of possible solutions by keeping only the ones that follow these conditions. Lets see how this works in the next example.  Suppose we want the solution to the differential equation . Etcept for the initial condition, this is the same equation we solved in the previous section, which has the general solution . The initial condition, , tells us that \" must equal 2 when is 0\". When we substitute and into , we see that we can solve for .     Therefore, forces and we get the particular solution . In can see the initial condition, , as the point on the -axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.    In the graph, the point on the -axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the -axis.  As you drag the point, make the following observations:   Each new value of gives a new value of , which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve).

  "body": "Summary & Exercises   Solving Initial Value Problems  For most of the techniques in this book, solving an initial value problem requires two main steps:  Solve for the general solution (with constants).  Compute the constants in the general solution using the initial conditions.     In this section and in the exercises that follow, we will be only concerned with step 2. So don't worry if you do not understand where these general solutions come from. In chapter 2, we will look at our first technique for solving a differential equation.   Summary of the Key Ideas      Solution of a Differential Equation         Verifying a function is a Solution         Types of Solutions         Initial Conditions           To prepare you for this discussion, let's review a few important points of the previous section that will be useful in this section.  The general solution of a differential equation contains a certain number of constants.  All different combinations of these constants give you the collection of possible solutions we called a family of solutions.  Specific values for the constants produces a particular solution.     Typically, the number of constants present in the general solution is equal to the order of the differential equation .  This is illustrated in ? since is of 2nd order and the general solution, , has 2 constants, and .     There are some exceptions when working with nonlinear DEs.     Discuss the difference between a general solution, family of solutions, and a particualr solution.  Given the differential equation determine if the following functions are solutions of this differential equation.    a.   b.   c.     d.   e.   f.     g.   h.   i.        a. No  b. Yes  c. Yes    d.

Yes      Match each function on the left with a DE on the right if this function is a solution (i.e. is in the family of solutions) for this DE.                                                            Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find all values of such that is a solution to .    Find the value of the constant in order for the differential equation to have the solution .    Is a solution of the differential equation  Yes  Find the value of    For each of the differential equations and function pairs, find all the possible values of such that the function is a solution to the DE.                      Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the general solution of a differential equation.  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution.  Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   Does an initial condition always give you a particular solution?  When there is one constant in the general solution, yes.  When there is more than one constant in the general solution, no.  It does, however, limit the possible values of the constants.   Consider the differential equation   Verify that the family of functions a solution to this differential equation.  Find the particular solution that corresponds to the initial condition .    Yes   , so is the particular solution   Consider the differential equation Which of the following is a family of solutions for this DE?        Find the particular solution such that .  b.   , so is the particular solution   Try first.  Compute       So for this function, it is not the solution.  Now try . Then   while   So this function is the solution  Setting we get   Solve for c,  So the solution for the IVP is   Understanding what it means to Solve a DE   We spend a lot of time solving equations, but do you even remember what it means to be a solution? Let's review what it means to be a solution to an algebraic equation (as in question ), and then what it means to be a solution to a differential equation (as in question ), and then we'll extend those ideas in questions and .   Verify that is a solution to the equation  What confirms that is a solution? the LHS = RHS after substituting into both sides of the equation.  ( Note: Do not rearrange the equation to solve for . That would be the process of finding a solution; you are asked to verify a solution. ) Since we get the same result (21) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the equation. We substitute into the left hand side (LHS) of the equation, and then into the right hand side (RHS) of the equation: Since we get the same result when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.  Verify that is a solution to the DE  Look back at the previous question and think about what it means to be a solution to a DE. Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the DE. We need to substitute into the DE. In order to substitute into the left hand side, we need to know the second derivative. So we begin by finding that. Now we can substitute into the DE: Since when we substitute in to the DE, we find that the LHS is equal to the RHS, we have verified that is a solution to the DE   Consider the DE  Find all values of such that is a solution to the DE by taking derivatives and substituting into the DE, and then solving for .  no matter the value of or Therefore we might want to factor it out as it won't contribute to our answer.   First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE and solve for : Recall that no matter the value of or Thus we have: So the two solutions are   Now that you have (hopefully!) two values for choose one of the two values and then verify that is a solution for that value of  Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that (or ) is a solution to the DE.  The work here is for and the work for is similar.  First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Hence, we have shown that is a solution to the DE     Assuming the form of the solution of DE.  Find all values of such that is a solution of the DE     We proceed as in the previous question. First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Note that there is no value of that can guarantee that is 0. Hence we have So the two solutions are      "

  "body": "SOV Method  We are now going to discuss the steps involved in the separation of variables method. In order to use this method, the differential equation must be first-order and be separable .  Identifying a differential equation as first-order is as simple as observing the presence of a first derivative and no higher derivatives. In comparison, determining that an equation is separable is not always immediately apparent. Sometimes, it requires some algebra to rearrange the equation into a form where the method can be applied.  Separation of Variables  If a differential equation can be written in the separable form , then the general solution can be determined through the steps below.   Step 1: Separate      Step 2: Integrate      Step 3: Finalize  Isolate (if possible), and combine constants.     These problems serve as warm-up examples to familiarize you with the separation of variables method.

  "body": "SOV Examples  The following problems go beyond the basics and will require a little more algebra or more complex integration techniques to solve.    Solve the differential equation using separation of variables.      : The only derivative in our equation is , so this differential equation has order 1.   : The differential equation is seperable since it can be written as    : We use algebra to move all the terms to the left and all the terms to the right, giving    : We now integrate both sides with respect to , like so    : Finally, we attempt to isolate and combine constants.       Solve the differential equation below using the separation of variables method.      This differential equation is first order. Next, we need to check that this differential equation is separable by converting it into the form   Next, we will use algebra to move all the terms to the left and all the terms to the right.   With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to , like so    Note: We get from calculus, where is called the differential of . We are not actually cancelling the terms.  Second, we note that when we have an indefinite integral, we find a family of solutions, and therefore we usually add a \" \" to annotate the family of solutions. In this case, we will have a family of solutions on the left hand side of the equation and a separate family of solutions on the right hand side of the equation. However, we would not want to assume that it's the same ` \" on both sides of the equation, so we will annotate one by and the other by    Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. This gives:   This might feel done, but we should step back and think about what our goal is. Remember, we are looking for an unknown function that satisfies the DE. In this case, our unknown function is , so we should solve for . Let's carefully isolate step by step. We begin by grouping the constants together   Since and are both constants, it stands to reason that is a constant as well. Therefore, we can collapse this difference down to one constant, : In further examples of this section, we will omit this step of combining multiple constants and just write .     Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (?) with the equivalent equation (?)we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called . We could repeat this process every time we use the separation of variable solution technique. We'll always end up integrating both sides of the equation, we'll always end up grouping the constants together on one side of the equation, and we'll always re-name the difference of constants to name it a single constant. Since we end up repeating those same steps, we will typically omit the steps where we write down constants on both sides of the equation, then combine them to form a new one. In the next example, you'll see that we cut to the chase and write the result of just having one constant on one side of the equation.  Next, we want to solve for y.   Since is a constant, it should be clear that is just another constant. This allows us to replace this expression with a new constant, . In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant :     Let's try another example, and then we can step back and see if we can generalize this method of solution.    Solve the initial value problem     Clearly, this DE is first order, but is it separable? In order to determine this, we isolate the derivative on the left hand side of the equation. We can immediately see that this is separable with the following grouping: Have you noticed that we don't even know what the independent variable is? There's no information provided that lets us know. If you run across a situation like this in the context of a real-world scenario, you might think about the meaning of the variables. Is the quantity changing with respect to time? If so, then might be an appropriate independent variable. If the quantity changes spatially, then you might consider using for the independent variable since we often use that variable to represent a distance along an -axis. We don't have any context here, so we can choose any variable we like (except , of course!).   We'll proceed by assuming that the independent variable is . Then we can write the derivative as , and then completely separate as follows. With the variables completely separated, we can now integrate both sides of the equation.   We're almost done. Our last job is to combine constants and solve for the unknown function (i.e., the dependent variable ). Hence, the DE has solution where is any constant. Some students are tempted to further rewrite the final answer as or even However, neither of these are correct.     Verify our solution  As in the previous example, we don't have to check our answer, but one of the best parts about DEs is that we always can check, which means we can really know if we have the right solution. Let's check this one. We will substitute our solution back into the DE and verify that when we do, we get the same thing on both sides of the equation.    At first glance, it looks like we have different expressions on the left and right hand sides of the equation. However, if we recall the trigonometric identity then we can see that these expressions are, in fact equivalent. Thus, we have verified that , where is any constant, is a solution to the DE .  Now that we've practiced this solution technique a couple of times, let's summarize.   The final piece to this method involves isolating the solution, if possible, and applying any initial conditions that are given with the differential equation. We say \"if possible\" because sometimes, after integrating both sides of the equation, you get an expression that is impossible to solve for as an explicit function of . Let's take a look at an example of a situation where you can solve for and one where you cannot.    Solve the differential equation below using the separation of variables method.      Recall, we already showed this differential equation is separable in EXAMPLE REF, converting it into the form   Next, we will use algebra to move all the terms to the left and all the terms to the right.   With the variables completely separated, we now integrate both sides with respect to , like so     Now, we proceed by evaluating both integrals above. Using the substitution , we can integrate the left-hand side as . This gives:    Before we go any further, let's reflect a little bit on this business with the constants of integration. Compare equation (?) with the equivalent equation (?) we got after combining the contstants of integration. Notice that we ultimately end up with just one constant, which we called .

Next, multiply both sides of the equation by and then exponentiate both sides to undo the logarithm.   Now, we need to get the outside of the absolute value function. Dropping the absolute value signs on the left hand side requires adding \" \" to the right hand side: We are almost done. We can use algebra to solve for , as follows.

In fact, since this is our last simplification, we can just name the constant :     Applying separation of variables  Solve the following initial value problem.   It's always worth it when you first start solving DEs to step back and make sure you identify independent and dependent variables. Here is dependent and is independent. That means when we're done we hope to have a function   Also, even though the terminology we use is initial condition, we typically won't use that piece of information until the very end.  * Until we get to Laplace Transforms...    First let's verify that the DE is first order (it is!), and then we go about solving for the derivative.   Now that we have solved for the derivative, is it possible write the right hand side of the equation as a product of functions where one of the functions does not contain the dependent variable, and the other function does not contain the independent variable, ? That is, we'd like to write the DE in the form suggested below. Hopefully you can see that there is a way, by factoring out of each term on the right hand side, as below.   Now we need to completely separate variables.   The next step will be to integrate both sides of the equation. (If the integral on the right hand side is at all questionable to you, you should do take an extra step and actually do the substitution )   As before, we write only one constant of integration (recall that we're skipping a couple of steps here; details provided in Example 6).  Remember that our goal is to solve for the unknown function . Since it's currently inside of a logarithm, we exponentiate both sides of the equation.   We continue solving for .   Now we can use that initial condition, , to solve for . The initial condition can be read, \"when is zero, is 5.\" We substitute into our solution accordingly.   * mention that we can't call our solution!    Therefore, the solution to the IVP is     Verify: Does the solution satisfy both the DE and the initial condition?  helpful  Does the solution satisfy the DE?  Yes, the solution does satisfy the DE.   Does the solution satisfy the initial condition?  Yes, the solution does satisfy the initial condition.    Check your Understanding  True\/False         "

Applications  A 4-lb roast, initially at , is placed in a oven at 5:00 PM After 75 minutes it is found that the temperature of the roast is F. When will the roast be (medium rate)?   We take time in minutes, with corresponding to 5:00 PM We also assume (somewhat unrealistically) that at any instant the temperature of the roast is uniform throughout. We have , , and . Hence Now , implies that , so . We also know that when . Substitution of these values in the preceding equation yields Hence we finally solve the equation for (min), the total cooking time required.Because the roast was placed in the oven at 5:00 PM, it it should be removed at about 6:45 PM   Conceptual Questions  Explain why separating variables works as a method for solving ordinary differential equations.  Separation of variables works by isolating all terms involving to one side and all terms involving to the other. When this can be done, both sides can be integrated independently, allowing for the solution of the differential equation. This method effectively transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into the simpler task of integrating functions.   Why is it important for the equation to be \"separable\" in order to use the method of separation of variables? What does it mean for a differential equation to be separable?  For the method of separation of variables to be used, we must be able to write the differential equation in the form , effectively separating the variables and onto different sides of the equation. When a differential equation can be written in this way, it is called separable. Separability is crucial because it allows us to integrate each side with respect to its own variable, leading to a solution for in terms of .   Provide an example of a differential equation that is not separable and explain why the method of separation of variables cannot be applied to it.     In solving a differential equation using separation of variables, why might the constant of integration appear on both sides of the resulting equation?  After separating variables, we integrate both sides of the equation. Each integration will typically introduce its own constant of integration. Therefore, when we combine the results of these integrations, we often see a constant on both sides. These constants can often be combined into a single constant by subtracting one from the other.   Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield implicit solutions, while others yield explicit solutions. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit solutions, and provide examples of each.     True\/False: Every first-order ordinary differential equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables.       Which of the following differential equations is not separable?           True\/False: If a differential equation is separable, its solution will always be an explicit function of .     The process of writing a differential equation in the form is called _________ of variables.     Which of the following cannot be directly solved by separation of variables?           True\/False: The method of separation of variables can be directly applied to higher-order differential equations.     True\/False: If you can write a differential equation in the form , then it is separable.     A differential equation of the form without a term:   Is always separable  Is never separable  Can be separable depending on  Is an implicit equation     A structured exercise  Here is where we give the student the background information required to start accomplishing tasks.  Solve a separable DE using separation of variables.                   The second step to do. We'll be lazy and just include an answer.   Just the answer.   A little wrap up.    "

The first-order version of this is , but we can divide both sides of this equation by : . Since every first-order linear differential equation can always be written as , we call this the first-order linear standard form .   . The heart of this method is the first step: finding the correct integrating factor. The second step uses this factor to write the left side as a single derivative. Finally, the last step finds the solution by direct integration .  Step 1: Finding the Integrating Factor  Understanding how to find the integrating factor is crucial. Let's carefully walk through this important process.  Consider the differential equations (specific on the left, general on the right):   ,   .  We would like to rewrite the left side as a single derivative using the backward product rule . However, the alone suggests there is a missing second function that the product rule needs. Maybe there is a function that we can multiply both sides of the equation by to get the desired product rule. Let's call it for now and see if we can find it. We start by multiplying both sides by :   .   .  Notice that the left side almost looks like the product rule , except for the boxed value where should be (see below).   ,   .  This shows that the that works is the one that satisfies      .  Careful inspection shows that these are separable differential equations where the unknown can be found using separation of variables!        Although the solution conatains a constant, we only need one function that works, so we set . The function is called the integrating factor and finding it is the first step toward solving a first order differential equation.  The Integrating Factor  The integrating factor for the first-order linear differential equation   is given by and represents the function, when multiplied onto both sides of the equation, needed to write the left side as a derivative.    Step 2: Rewriting the Equation With the integrating factor in hand, we are ready to write the left side as a derivative using the backward product rule .  Integrating Factor:    Integrating Factor:  .    Step 3: Solving the Equation  The final step is to apply direct integration .

Integrating Factor  The general solution to the first-order linear DE in the standard form can be determined through the following steps:  Step 1: Find the Integrating Factor  .  Step 2: Rewrite the DE  Multiply the equation by , and rewrite it in the form    Step 3: Apply Direct Integration Integrate both sides of and solve for .     Now let's apply this to some examples.    Find the general solution to the differential equation  .    .    .   Multiply by :       Rewrite:               Solve    We always begin by classifying the DE. You should confirm that this DE is first order and linear, and therefore it is appropriate to use our integrating factor technique. Keep in mind that our goal is to find an unknown function that satisfies this equation.  We work first to get the DE in an appropriate form so that we can un-do the product rule. We begin by getting the dependent variable, and its derivative on the same side of the equation, and then we multiply both sides of the equation by so that the coefficient on the derivative is 1.   If follow the process we took in the previous example, we would first multiply by the unknown function that will help us un-do the product rule, then we would determine . Instead, let's first determine , and then we'll multiply by it. As in ( ), we need to identify the function that is attached to the independent variable by multiplication. In equation ( ), we have , (note the inclusion of the negative sign) so we know that the function that will help us un-do the product rule is given by (Note, again, that we seek only one function , so we omit the absolute value and the that we normally see when we integrate the function )  While our integrating factor is technically correct, it can (and should) be simplified using rules of logarithms as follows.   We'll end up using lots of rules of logarithms throughout this chapter; review those rules (HERE) if you need a refresher.  Now that we have identified the integrating factor , we can multiply both sides of the DE (which we put in standard form in ( )) by it.   If we have correctly determined the integrating factor, then we should be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side. Notice that we can identify the functions and as follows.   It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   We've made a big step forward, here! Remember that our goal is to find the unknown function , so we are much closer since we appears in only one place in this equation. In order to un-do the differentiation, we can integrate both sides of the equation.   Finally, we can solve for by multiplying both sides of the equation by    We have made a point of simplifying whenever possible, and you should look to do that as you work. You may be tempted to replace the with a single constant; remember, however, that a constant times a function is not a constant, so we cannot simplify that last term any further.  Hence, we have found the solution to the DE. We can always verify our solution by substituting back in to the original DE. This is optional, but the details are included here.       Solve the following initial value problem.    As always, we begin by identifying the independent and dependent variables and classifying the DE.  independent variable:   dependent variable:   order: first order  linearity: linear  goal: solve for the unknown function     Since this DE is first order and linear, we can use the integrating factor technique. We begin to put the DE in standard form for this technique by getting the dependent variable and its derivative on the left hand side of the equals sign.   Next we want to make the coefficient on the term equal to 1. We can divide by , which is equivalent to multiplying by    Now we can identify the function , which consists of whatever is attached to the dependent variable by multiplication. In this case, . Then we find as follows.   (As before, we need only one integrating factor , so we omit the we normally see when we evaluate an indefinite integral).  Once we have identified our integrating factor, we can multiply both sides of the DE in its standard form (as in equation ( )) by the function .   If we have correctly determined the integrating factor , we should be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side. We can identify the functions and below:   It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   Our goal is to solve for . Since it is currently inside the derivative, we will integrate both sides of the equation.   In order to evaluate the integral on the right hand side, we can make the substitution , which means that , or equivalently .   Now we can solve for .   Finally, we need to apply the initial condition we are provided so that we can determine the constant .   We can then write the particular solution to the initial value problem.   As usual, we can check our answer by substituting back into the original DE. While this step is not required, it is always a good idea to check and we include the details here.       Consider the following DE.    First we note that this equation is first order and linear.  Our first step would be to move closer to seeing the form shown in . As such, we will put the terms containing the derivative, , and the function, , on the same of the equation.

Keep in mind that our goal is to find an unknown function that satisfies this equation.  We work first to get the DE in an appropriate form so that we can un-do the product rule. We begin by getting the dependent variable, and its derivative on the same side of the equation, and then we multiply both sides of the equation by so that the coefficient on the derivative is 1.   If follow the process we took in the previous example, we would first multiply by the unknown function that will help us un-do the product rule, then we would determine . Instead, let's first determine , and then we'll multiply by it. As in ( ), we need to identify the function that is attached to the independent variable by multiplication. In equation ( ), we have , (note the inclusion of the negative sign) so we know that the function that will help us un-do the product rule is given by (Note, again, that we seek only one function , so we omit the absolute value and the that we normally see when we integrate the function )  While our integrating factor is technically correct, it can (and should) be simplified using rules of logarithms as follows.   We'll end up using lots of rules of logarithms throughout this chapter; review those rules (HERE) if you need a refresher.  Now that we have identified the integrating factor , we can multiply both sides of the DE (which we put in standard form in ( )) by it.   If we have correctly determined the integrating factor, then we should be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side. Notice that we can identify the functions and as follows.   It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   We've made a big step forward, here! Remember that our goal is to find the unknown function , so we are much closer since we appears in only one place in this equation. In order to un-do the differentiation, we can integrate both sides of the equation.   Finally, we can solve for by multiplying both sides of the equation by    We have made a point of simplifying whenever possible, and you should look to do that as you work. You may be tempted to replace the with a single constant; remember, however, that a constant times a function is not a constant, so we cannot simplify that last term any further.  Hence, we have found the solution to the DE. We can always verify our solution by substituting back in to the original DE. This is optional, but the details are included here.     "

Additional Examples    Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation     As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.  The term makes the DE nonlinear.  This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the and terms cannot be separated by multiplication.  Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.     Given that is some unknown function of , compute .

Suppose the following expression is the derivative of a product of two functions, where is a function of : Find the two functions and write down the derivative of their product, explicitly showing the steps involving the product rule.   We are still trying to identify two functions, and , such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We may need to rearrange a little bit, but we do in fact have such functions, as shown below. Hence, and and the derivative, using the product rule, is   Warning: You've been looking at a very special class of expressions! Not every sum of terms comes from the product rule. For example, we cannot un-do the product rule in the expression because the derivative of is not . You should pay close attention to whether you can or cannot un-do the product rule; this can help confirm if you have or have not made a mistake in solving a DE. We'll discuss this further later.     Rewrite the expression as a \"reversed product rule\" in the form    We will approach this as before and attempt to match the appropriate terms.  The product rule tells us that is the same as   We used the chain rule to compute   After arranging the terms, we match with and see that can only be matched to . So, and this means that is the anti-derivative of , or This shows that there are many possible answers (one for each value of ), but only one is required. So we pick which makes and conclude that      Find a function, , such that tbe product rule applied to gives    As we did before, we need to identify functions such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We might label them as follows.   Based on the labeling in the question above, if we are going to be able to un-do the product rule, we need the function to be such that its derivative is . We can translate that into a mathematical statement:   In order to determine the unknown function , we need to solve a differential equation! It turns out that this DE is first order and separable, so we can solve it using separation of variables.   While we could choose any value for that we like, we are looking for just one function , so we will simplify things by choosing . Thus, the function we found is . Now let's confirm that it works. If we substitute our function in for in , then we can un-do the product rule as follows:   Notice that if we identify as the function , then we do indeed see its derivative, in the other term. If we made a mistake in finding the function , this would be the point where we could catch our mistake.     Suppose is a function of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    It may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.   If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function such that   This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.   Since we need only one function , we can choose any value we like for . Here we will choose , and therefore the function is . We can check by un-doing the product rule.      Suppose and are functions of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    This is a generic version of the previous example. If we can draw a conclusion using this generic version, we might be able to use it in future examples.  As before, it may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.   If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function such that   This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.   Since we need only one function , we usually choose the positive one and therefore we write .  This may not look like much, but let's see if it would work for the previous examples already did. Recall that we were trying to un-do the product rule in the expression   In this example, we would identify the function as . Then the function we desire would be given by   (Notice that we chose because we need only one function , and this is the simplest choice for ).  So our formula does give the same function we found previously. Let's practice one more.     Suppose is a function of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    In this example, the plays the same role as (in the previous EXAMPLE). Thus we can find in a similar way.   As in the previous example, we need only one function , so we can simplify this expression. In this case, we can choose , and we can also eliminate the absolute value. This lead us to , which further simplifies to . As in the previous examples, we can replace in the original expression and then actually un-do the product rule.      Additional Practice   We know that can be written as So we must match these terms with the terms in . Writing out these terms side-by-side helps determine the matching, as shown here   Matching the terms of the top and middle expressions in order to reverse the product rule. Notice the terms are already equal, so we only need to find .      From the figure we see that since it is the term next to . Moreover, a quick check also shows that completing the matching.  In this chapter, we will study a solution technique that will help us solve differential equations that are first order and linear. Consider this (carefully selected) example. Notice that the dependent variable is and the independent variable is , so we seek to find a formula for in terms of . The DE is also first order and linear.  What makes this DE special is that the left hand side can be rewritten as follows. We can verify this by actually using the product rule to take the derivative on the left hand side:   Now that we have confirmed that Equation is equivalent to Equation , we can proceed in solving the DE.  The unknown function we want to solve for is , and it is part of the product we are taking the derivative of in Equation . So we begin by undoing that differentiation by integrating both sides of Equation with respect to :   We can now just divide both sides of Equation by the coefficient on to obtain the general solution.   Recall that we said this was a carefully selected DE. This very special DE had the property that we could undo the product rule on its left hand side. This is not, in general, the case when we encounter a first order linear DE. For example, consider this DE.  (use one of the first examples we do in the book??)  We cannot immediately undo the product rule here, but there is some hope. We do see the unknown function and its derivative, so we have some of the stuff we need to undo the product rule. What we'll see in this chapter is that we can manipulate the DE so that we will be able to undo the product rule and proceed to solve as we did in the example above, and so we begin this chapter by focusing on the details around making that possible.  The integration factor technique relies heavily on our understanding of the product rule for differentiation, so let's quickly recall what this looks like and go over some examples.       or        product rule   DO WE WANT A SUMMARY?  Let's summarize the procedure we have been working on.   Solving First Order Linear DEs with an Integrating Factor   Verify that the DE is first order and linear. (Don't overlook this step!! Nothing that follows here makes any sense if the DE isn't both first order and linear.)  Rearrange the DE to put it in standard form for this solution technique. In standard form, the dependent variable and the derivative are on the left hand side of the equation and the coefficient on the derivative is 1. (Here we assume that is the independent variable and is the dependent variable; this will look different if your DE has different independent and dependent variables).  Identify the function and then find the integrating factor (Note that we integrate with respect to the independent variable. We also need only one integrating factor, so we typically omit the that is ordinarily associated with an indefinite integral.)  Multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.  Rewrite the left hand side of the DE by \"un-doing\" the product rule. This is the crucial step where you should check to make sure that you really can un-do the product rule. If you can't then check to make sure you correctly determined determined the integrating factor.  Integrate both sides of the equation (with respect to the independent variable). (Here you should have a constant of integration.)  Solve for the dependent variable to get the general solution.  If an initial condition is provided, apply it last to determine the value of the constant of integration.    The idea in the previous examples will be at the center of helping us solve the DEs of this chapter, but we need to expand on this a bit to fully prepare you for the discussion in the next section. Let's now dive into the following examples to see what we mean.   Taken From Integrating Factor   and then we integrate both sides with respect to to free the unknown from inside the , so that we can solve for it. However, we have not talked about how the integrating factor gets the differential equation into this form. Luckily, the product rule for deriviatives holds the answer. Therefore, let's start this discussing by reminding ourselves that the product rule is given by   Ok, the claim is that after a some math the differential equation can be rewritten as To explain this, it may be easier to work backwards. That is, let's start with and see how it may connect back to . We start by applying the product rule on the left side, At this point stop and compare equation with the last equation . Do you see how the two equations are connected?  You should see that multiplying both sides of by gives you .  In a nutshell, the integrating factor technique attempts to solve by multiplying both sides by an unknown function,  then find a so that the left-hand side can be written as the product rule of and .   To clarify, let's look at an example where we know .  The previous example shows how to solve the equation when you know what is. However, in a real problem, you will have to find first!  Let's build on the previous example to try and understand why worked. It is important to try and think of as the missing part needed to to be consistent with the product rule. That is, the left-side of the equation is missing a second function needed to be consistent with the product rule. So let's fill-in this missing function by multiplying both sides by , Is the left-side, , equal to ? Well, not exactly, since taking this derivative shows the difference between these two, namely                                  difference             left-side           However, what if was chosen so that ? It turns out that this is exactly how we chose . Finding such that is itself a differential equation which can be solved using separation of variables. (You may try it yourself first for practice, then look below to see how to solve this DE.)  Using separation of variables, solve to get the solution    Since, we only need one to work, we choose for convenience, hence Now you see where the came from in part 1 of . In fact, this example outlines how is found for any first order linear differential equation of the form    "

Now, consider a function whose derivative is a multiple of itself, like . You might think of . If this isn't obvious, you can solve using separation of variables to find .

  "body": "Higher-Order LHCC  As in the previous section, the approach to solving higher-order linear homogeneous constant coefficient (LHCC) equations is fairly straightforward. Find the solutions to the characteristic equation and use them to write down each term of the general solution. The key difference lies in the fact that you must solve a high-degree polynomial equation, which can be challenging since you no longer have a simple formula to give you the solutions.  To see this, consider the -th order LHCC equation, , which has an -th degree characteristic equation .     Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions            Let's solve a third-order LHCC equation:  .   First, write down the characteristic equation:  . Solving for , we get three distinct real roots:  . Therefore, the general solution is:  .     Consider another example, a fourth-order LHCC equation:  .   The characteristic equation is:  . Let , then we can rewrite the equation as:  . Solving for , we get:  . Thus, gives , and gives . The general solution is:  .   As seen in these examples, solving the characteristic equation for higher-order LHCC equations follows the same principles as for lower-order equations. However, as the degree of the polynomial increases, solving the characteristic equation analytically can become impractical due to the complexity of the roots.  For higher-degree characteristic equations, numerical methods and computer algebra systems are typically employed to find the roots. Software tools like MATLAB, Mathematica, and even graphing calculators can assist in solving these polynomial equations, allowing us to focus on interpreting and utilizing the solutions.    Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:  .   The characteristic equation is:  . Solving this polynomial equation analytically is challenging, so we use a numerical solver. The roots are found to be approximately:  . The general solution, incorporating these roots, is:  .   By recognizing the type of roots and using technology to solve higher-degree polynomials, we can extend our approach to solve any higher-order LHCC equation effectively.

For ease of discussion, we will refer to it as the \"LHCC method.\" \"LHCC\" is an acronym indicating the properties of DE it solves.

If it is a solution, then you would expect all the terms to cancel out, leaving you with zero so that the equation is satisfied.  In the case of a nonhomogeneous equation, , you would instead expect the left side to simplify to after plugging in a solution. Let's brainstorm some functions that might simplify to .       Since we need the left side to simplify to , it seems reasonable to consider functions that have terms, such as polynomials. Let's try some below.

However, hidden within these solutions could be terms that cancel out with each other instead of contributing to the term on the right-hand side.  To see this, let's bring back the equation from the last section, , which we know has as a solution. Would it still be a solution if we tossed another term, say , onto it so that ? To find out, we plug it in and track this new term (in blue), like so   There is a lot built into this result, so let's carefully break it down.   First, is a solution since it satisfies .

However, there is one last detail that we still need to address. In particular, we need to know what to do when the selected form of has overlapping like-terms with the homogeneous solution, . In this section we will explain why this is a problem and how to fix it.  To illustrate this concept, note that the differential equation . has a particular solution of the form . Plugging it in gives which leads to an obvious problem. Recall that the parts of an LNCC general solution tells you that if simplifies to , then it must be part of the homogeneous solution!  Now, let's attempt to find a particular solution, . Since the right-hand side of the original equation is , we might initially guess: However, this term is already part of the homogeneous solution, . If we use this guess, we will not obtain a valid particular solution because it will be absorbed into the homogeneous part. To circumvent this, we adjust our guess by multiplying by to ensure linear independence:      Let's verify if this adjusted guess works by plugging it into the original equation. We find the necessary derivatives:   Substituting these into the differential equation: Simplifying, we get:   This simplifies to: Thus, we find:   Therefore, the particular solution is:   This example demonstrates the importance of adjusting the form of when it overlaps with . In general, if our initial guess for contains any term that is also part of , we multiply that term by to ensure independence. If the overlap persists, we multiply by higher powers of (e.g., , ) until the terms are linearly independent.  This adjustment process ensures that our particular solution remains valid and that we can correctly solve the differential equation. By recognizing when to adjust , we refine our approach to handling linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations effectively.  Check your Understanding   Needs to be written   OK     "

  "body": "Summary & Exercises    Summary:   The method of undetermined coefficients is used to solve non-homogeneous linear differential equations.  The general solution to a non-homogeneous equation is the sum of the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution.  The method involves guessing the form of the particular solution based on the form of the non-homogeneous term and solving for the coefficients.  The method is applicable when the non-homogeneous term can be expressed as a linear combination of known functions.    The method of undetermined coefficients involves the following steps:   Verify that the method is applicable to the given differential equation.  Find the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation.  Guess the form of the particular solution based on the form of the non-homogeneous term.  Solve for the coefficients of the particular solution.  Combine the general solution of the homogeneous equation with the particular solution to obtain the complete solution.    Summary of the Key Ideas    Method          1  Exercise 1 Statement   2  Exercise 2 Statement   Describe the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation. A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives. For example, the equation is non-homogeneous because of the term on the right side, which is not a derivative or multiple of . The distinction between homogeneous and non-homogeneous differential equations is crucial as the methods used to solve them can differ.  Solve the following IVP by following the guidelines provided.   Fin the solution to the associated homogeneous DE.  Fin the solution to the associated homogeneous DE.  Guess the form o a particular solution, by looking at theform of the non-homogenous part of the DE.   \\\\ We look at the non-homogenous terms in the DE. In this case, the non-homogeneous part of the DE is Based on this function, we would assume that the particular solutio has a similar form, so we would guess We refer back to th we found previously and we make sure there are no terms like this that are i . In this case, our choice o is not a repeat of terms i , so we are satisfied with our choice o   For this problem should have just one constant, sa Substitut back into the original DE to determine that coefficient. Then write dow    \\\\ We need to substitute into the original DE, so we need to find the first and second derivatives. No we sub in to the original DE and solve for the coefficien .

Solve the same IVP using an integrating factor and compareyour answers.   \\\\ First we put DE in standard form for a first-order linear DE so we can identif In this case is the dependent variable (i.e., it behaves lik ) an is the independent variable (i.e., it behaves lik ), so the standard form we seek i so we can identif  Thus Then we find the integrating facto  Now we multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor. Now we recall the product rule for derivatives: We note that the two terms on the left hand side of equation (\\ref{eq20}) are the result of taking the derivative of the product. Hence we can undo the product rule as follows: Now we can integrate both sides of the equation and then solve for the dependent variable. On the left hand side we will need to integration by parts. We begin by choosin an and then we can find th the derivative o , an , the antiderivative o as follows. Hence we have The new integral is an improvement, but will require another integration by parts. Again, we choose an as follows. Hence we continue solving our DE as follows: We now take the general solution and apply the initial conditio so that we can solve for the particular solution. Hence, the solution to this IVP i (which is the same answer we got using the method of undetermined coefficients).    Determine which method(s) could be used to solve each differential equation.

  "body": "Orphaned Content   This is just a place to put content that was written and may or not be used.   We can write this solution as . Substituting this into the equation and separating the and parts gives   Notice that each part looks like we separately plugged and into the left side of . Now, suppose the part simplified to and the part gave you , then the sum of these parts still equal . This of as the parts of the solution that cancel out with each other and as the parts that simplify to (like in the previous section).  We can get these two parts by separately solving the equations, , for and . Adding these together gives the general solution, . The next example summarizes this process.  Additional Examples    Determine a particular solution to     The point here is to find a particular solution, however the first thing that we're going to do is find the homogeneous solution to this differential equation. Recall that the homogeneous solution comes from solving,   The characteristic equation for this differential equation and its roots are.   The homogeneous solution is then,   At this point the reason for doing this first will not be apparent, however we want you in the habit of finding it before we start the work to find a particular solution. Eventually, as we'll see, having the homogeneous solution in hand will be helpful and so it's best to be in the habit of finding it first prior to doing the work for undetermined coefficients.  Now, let's proceed with finding a particular solution. As mentioned prior to the start of this example we need to make a guess as to the form of a particular solution to this differential equation. Since is an exponential and we know that exponentials never just appear or disappear in the differentiation process it seems that a likely form of the particular solution would be   Now, all that we need to do is do a couple of derivatives, plug this into the differential equation and see if we can determine what needs to be.  Plugging into the differential equation gives   So, in order for our guess to be a solution we will need to choose so that, Okay, we found a value for the coefficient. This means that we guessed correctly. A particular solution to the differential equation is then,       Solve the following initial value problem.     We know that the general solution will be of the form,   and we already have both the homogeneous and particular solution from the first example so we don't really need to do any extra work for this problem.  One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to find the homogeneous solution and then, because we're probably in the habit of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the homogeneous solution to find the constants. This however, is incorrect. The homogeneous solution is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the homogeneous solution.  So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation. Taking the homogeneous solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example we get the following for a general solution and its derivative.   Now, apply the initial conditions to these.   Solving this system gives . The actual solution is then.      Find a particular solution for the equation    Again, let's note that we should probably find the homogeneous solution before we proceed onto the guess for a particular solution. However, because the homogeneous differential equation for this example is the same as that for the first example we won't bother with that here.  Now, let's take our experience from the first example and apply that here. The first example had an exponential function in the and our guess was an exponential. This differential equation has a sine so let's try the following guess for the particular solution.   Differentiating and plugging into the differential equation gives,   Collecting like terms yields   We need to pick so that we get the same function on both sides of the equal sign. This means that the coefficients of the sines and cosines must be equal. Or,   Notice two things. First, since there is no cosine on the right hand side this means that the coefficient must be zero on that side. More importantly we have a serious problem here. In order for the cosine to drop out, as it must in order for the guess to satisfy the differential equation, we need to set to keep the sine around will also keep the cosine around.  What this means is that our initial guess was wrong. If we get multiple values of the same constant or are unable to find the value of a constant then we have guessed wrong.  One of the nicer aspects of this method is that when we guess wrong our work will often suggest a fix. In this case the problem was the cosine that cropped up. So, to counter this let's add a cosine to our guess. Our new guess is   Plugging this into the differential equation and collecting like terms gives,   Now, set the coefficients equal   Solving this system gives us   We found constants and this time we guessed correctly. A particular solution to the differential equation is then,      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    Once, again we will generally want the homogeneous solution in hand first, but again we're working with the same homogeneous differential equation (you'll eventually see why we keep working with the same homogeneous problem) so we'll again just refer to the first example.  For this example, is a cubic polynomial. For this we will need the following guess for the particular solution.   Notice that even though in it our guess will still need one! So, differentiate and plug into the differential equation.   Now, as we've done in the previous examples we will need the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equal sign to be the same so set coefficients equal and solve. Notice that in this case it was very easy to solve for the constants. The first equation gave , etc . A particular solution for this differential equation is then      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    You're probably getting tired of the opening comment, but again finding the homogeneous solution first really a good idea but again we've already done the work in the first example so we won't do it again here. We promise that eventually you'll see why we keep using the same homogeneous problem and why we say it's a good idea to have the homogeneous solution in hand first. At this point all we're trying to do is reinforce the habit of finding the homogeneous solution first.  Okay, let's start off by writing down the guesses for the individual pieces of the function. The guess for the would be   while the guess for the exponential would be   Now, since we've got a product of two functions it seems like taking a product of the guesses for the individual pieces might work. Doing this would give   However, we will have problems with this. As we will see, when we plug our guess into the differential equation we will only get two equations out of this. The problem is that with this guess we've got three unknown constants. With only two equations we won't be able to solve for all the constants.  This is easy to fix however. Let's notice that we could do the following   If we multiply the through, we can see that the guess can be written in such a way that there are really only two constants. So, we will use the following for our guess.   Notice that this is nothing more than the guess for the with an exponential tacked on for good measure.  Now that we've got our guess, let's differentiate, plug into the differential equation and collect like terms.   Note that when we're collecting like terms we want the coefficient of each term to have only constants in it. Following this rule we will get two terms when we collect like terms. Now, set coefficients equal.   A particular solution for this differential equation is then      Write down the form of the particular solution to        a g\\left( t \\right) = 16{{\\bf{e}}^{7t}}\\sin \\left( {10t} \\right)  So, we have an exponential in the function. Remember the rule. We will ignore the exponential and write down a guess for then put the exponential back in.  The guess for the sine is   Now, for the actual guess for the particular solution we'll take the above guess and tack an exponential onto it. This gives,   One final note before we move onto the next part. The 16 in front of the function has absolutely no bearing on our guess. Any constants multiplying the whole function are ignored.    b g\\left( t \\right) = \\left( {9{t^2} - 103t} \\right)\\cos t  We will start this one the same way that we initially started the previous example. The guess for the polynomial is   and the guess for the cosine is   If we multiply the two guesses we get.   Let's simplify things up a little. First multiply the polynomial through as follows.   Notice that everywhere one of the unknown constants occurs it is in a product of unknown constants. This means that if we went through and used this as our guess the system of equations that we would need to solve for the unknown constants would have products of the unknowns in them. These types of systems are generally very difficult to solve.  So, to avoid this we will do the same thing that we did in the previous example. Everywhere we see a product of constants we will rename it and call it a single constant. The guess that we'll use for this function will be.   This is a general rule that we will use when faced with a product of a polynomial and a trig function. We write down the guess for the polynomial and then multiply that by a cosine. We then write down the guess for the polynomial again, using different coefficients, and multiply this by a sine.    c g\\left( t \\right) = - {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}}\\left( {3 - 5t} \\right)\\cos \\left( {9t} \\right)  This final part has all three parts to it. First, we will ignore the exponential and write down a guess for.   The minus sign can also be ignored. The guess for this is   Now, tack an exponential back on and we're done.   Notice that we put the exponential on both terms.      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    This example is the reason that we've been using the same homogeneous differential equation for all the previous examples. There is nothing to do with this problem. All that we need to do it go back to the appropriate examples above and get the particular solution from that example and add them all together.  Doing this gives      Write down the form of the particular solution to  for the following 's.            a g\\left( t \\right) = 4\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - 9\\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This first one we've actually already told you how to do. This is in the table of the basic functions. However, we wanted to justify the guess that we put down there. Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give.   So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from each guess. The problem with this as a guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns. We will never be able to solve for each of the constants.  To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as follows.   Upon doing this we can see that we've really got a single cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may as well just use   The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms with single coefficients. This will greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients.    b g\\left( t \\right) = - 2\\sin t + \\sin \\left( {14t} \\right) - 5\\cos \\left( {14t} \\right)  For this one we will get two sets of sines and cosines. This will arise because we have two different arguments in them. We will get one set for the sine with just a as their arguments.  The guess for this function is     c g\\left( t \\right) = {{\\bf{e}}^{7t}} + 6  The main point of this problem is dealing with the constant. But that isn't too bad. We just wanted to make sure that an example of that is somewhere in the notes. If you recall that a constant is nothing more than a zeroth degree polynomial the guess becomes clear.  The guess for this function is     d g\\left( t \\right) = 6{t^2} - 7\\sin \\left( {3t} \\right) + 9  This one can be a little tricky if you aren't paying attention. Let's first rewrite the function   All we did was move the 9. However, upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a quadratic polynomial and a sine. The guess for this is then   If we don't do this and treat the function as the sum of three terms we would get   and as with the first part in this example we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same (the ) and so would need to be combined. An added step that isn't really necessary if we first rewrite the function.  Look for problems where rearranging the function can simplify the initial guess.    e g\\left( t \\right) = 10{{\\bf{e}}^t} - 5t{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}} + 2{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}  So, this look like we've got a sum of three terms here. Let's write down a guess for that.   Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same and would need to be combined. This is a case where the guess for one term is completely contained in the guess for a different term. When this happens we just drop the guess that's already included in the other term.  So, the guess here is actually.   Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our whose only difference was the polynomial that sat in front of them. When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree polynomial, write down the guess for that and don't bother writing down the guess for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first guess.    f g\\left( t \\right) = {t^2}\\cos t - 5t\\sin t  In this case we've got two terms whose guess without the polynomials in front of them would be the same. Therefore, we will take the one with the largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that one and ignore the other term. So, the guess for the function is     g g\\left( t \\right) = 5{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}} + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}}\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - \\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This last part is designed to make sure you understand the general rule that we used in the last two parts. This time there really are three terms and we will need a guess for each term. The guess here is   We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to the constant. So, we can't combine the first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different functions. Likewise, the last sine and cosine can't be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are different.      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    This problem seems almost too simple to be given this late in the section. This is especially true given the ease of finding a particular solution for )'s that are just exponential functions. Also, because the point of this example is to illustrate why it is generally a good idea to have the homogeneous solution in hand first we'll let's go ahead and recall the homogeneous solution first. Here it is,   Now, without worrying about the homogeneous solution for a couple more seconds let's go ahead and get to work on the particular solution. There is not much to the guess here. From our previous work we know that the guess for the particular solution should be,   Plugging this into the differential equation gives,   Hmmmm…. Something seems wrong here. Clearly an exponential can't be zero. So, what went wrong? We finally need the homogeneous solution. Notice that the second term in the homogeneous solution (listed above) is exactly our guess for the form of the particular solution and now recall that both portions of the homogeneous solution are solutions to the homogeneous differential equation,   In other words, we had better have gotten zero by plugging our guess into the differential equation, it is a solution to the homogeneous differential equation!  So, how do we fix this? The way that we fix this is to add a to our guess as follows.   Plugging this into our differential equation gives,   Now, we can set coefficients equal.   So, the particular solution in this case is,      Write down the guess for the particular solution to the given differential equation. Do not find the coefficients.          In these solutions we'll leave the details of checking the homogeneous solution to you.   a y'' + 3y' - 28y = 7t + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 7t}} - 1  The homogeneous solution is   Remembering to put the -1 with the 7 gives a first guess for the particular solution.   Notice that the last term in the guess is the last term in the homogeneous solution. The first two terms however aren't a problem and don't appear in the homogeneous solution. Therefore, we will only add a onto the last term.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution is.     b y'' - 100y = 9{t^2}{{\\bf{e}}^{10t}} + \\cos t - t\\sin t  The homogeneous solution is   A first guess for the particular solution is   Notice that if we multiplied the exponential term through the parenthesis that we would end up getting part of the homogeneous solution showing up. Since the problem part arises from the first term the whole first term will get multiplied by . The second and third terms are okay as they are.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution in this case is.   So, in general, if you were to multiply out a guess and if any term in the result shows up in the homogeneous solution, then the whole term will get a not just the problem portion of the term.    c    The homogeneous solution is   A first guess for the particular solution is   In this case both the second and third terms contain portions of the homogeneous solution. The first term doesn't however, since upon multiplying out, both the sine and the cosine would have an exponential with them and that isn't part of the homogeneous solution. We only need to worry about terms showing up in the homogeneous solution if the only difference between the homogeneous solution term and the particular guess term is the constant in front of them.

This is in the table of the basic functions. However, we wanted to justify the guess that we put down there. Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give.   So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from each guess. The problem with this as a guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns. We will never be able to solve for each of the constants.  To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as follows.   Upon doing this we can see that we've really got a single cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may as well just use   The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms with single coefficients. This will greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients.    b g\\left( t \\right) = - 2\\sin t + \\sin \\left( {14t} \\right) - 5\\cos \\left( {14t} \\right)  For this one we will get two sets of sines and cosines. This will arise because we have two different arguments in them. We will get one set for the sine with just a as their arguments.  The guess for this function is     c g\\left( t \\right) = {{\\bf{e}}^{7t}} + 6  The main point of this problem is dealing with the constant. But that isn't too bad. We just wanted to make sure that an example of that is somewhere in the notes. If you recall that a constant is nothing more than a zeroth degree polynomial the guess becomes clear.  The guess for this function is     d g\\left( t \\right) = 6{t^2} - 7\\sin \\left( {3t} \\right) + 9  This one can be a little tricky if you aren't paying attention. Let's first rewrite the function   All we did was move the 9. However, upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a quadratic polynomial and a sine. The guess for this is then   If we don't do this and treat the function as the sum of three terms we would get   and as with the first part in this example we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same (the ) and so would need to be combined. An added step that isn't really necessary if we first rewrite the function.  Look for problems where rearranging the function can simplify the initial guess.    e g\\left( t \\right) = 10{{\\bf{e}}^t} - 5t{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}} + 2{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}  So, this look like we've got a sum of three terms here. Let's write down a guess for that.   Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same and would need to be combined. This is a case where the guess for one term is completely contained in the guess for a different term. When this happens we just drop the guess that's already included in the other term.  So, the guess here is actually.   Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our whose only difference was the polynomial that sat in front of them. When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree polynomial, write down the guess for that and don't bother writing down the guess for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first guess.    f g\\left( t \\right) = {t^2}\\cos t - 5t\\sin t  In this case we've got two terms whose guess without the polynomials in front of them would be the same. Therefore, we will take the one with the largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that one and ignore the other term. So, the guess for the function is     g g\\left( t \\right) = 5{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}} + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}}\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - \\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This last part is designed to make sure you understand the general rule that we used in the last two parts. This time there really are three terms and we will need a guess for each term. The guess here is   We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to the constant. So, we can't combine the first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different functions. Likewise, the last sine and cosine can't be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are different.    "

We formalize this with the following definition.  Laplace Transform  The Laplace Transform of a given function is defined as provided that the integral exists (i.e., the improper integral converges).   This definition might seem intimidating at first, but let's break it down. The in the upper limit indicates that the Laplace transform is an improper integral. In calculus, we learn that such an integral can be rewritten as a limit. Specifically, Also, note that the integral involves two variables, and , but we integrate with respect to .

While these values are important, they generally do not affect the solution of the differential equations in practice. Nonetheless, we will continue to note them as we build our Laplace transform toolbox.    The notation for the Laplace transform involves the symbol The curly braces that accompany it are not optional; they indicate precisely which function we are transforming.     At this point, we've introduced our first Laplace transform. In the next section, we will build a collection of the most common tranforms used to solve differential equations.

  "body": "Properties of Laplace Transforms  Now that we've explored individual Laplace transforms, its time to delve into some of the key properties that make the Laplace transform such a powerful tool for solving differential equations. These properties allow us to manipulate and combine transforms in ways that simplify complex problems.  Linearity  The first property we'll explore is linearity. This property is foundational because it allows us to break down and combine transforms easily. The linearity of the Laplace transform is similar to the linearity of integrals, where we can distribute the transform across addition and subtraction, and pull out constants.    Use the definition of the Laplace transform to compute:   Let's start by applying the definition of the Laplace transform: Here, we've expanded the expression inside the integral. Notice that each term is something we've already encountered in previous sections. We can now use the linearity property to separate the integral: We already know the Laplace transforms of these individual functions: To satisfy all the conditions on , we must have since that ensures all terms are defined. Therefore:     This example demonstrates the linearity property in action. The general statement of the linearity property is as follows: if and are constants, then: or, equivalently:   Laplace Transform Property          Check your Understanding  True-False. The linearity property allows you to find the Laplace transform of a sum of functions by adding the Laplace transforms of the individual functions.  True. The linearity property states that the Laplace transform of a sum of functions is the sum of the individual Laplace transforms.   True-False. If and , then is equal to .  False. The correct expression is , not .   True-False. The Laplace transform of a constant times a function is the constant times the Laplace transform of the function.  True. The linearity property allows you to factor out constants from the Laplace transform.   True-False. The linearity property can be used to break down the Laplace transform of into the sum of two simpler Laplace transforms.  True. The linearity property allows you to separate the Laplace transform into the sum (or difference) of the transforms of each term.   True-False. The linearity property only works for the addition of functions, not subtraction.  False. The linearity property applies to both addition and subtraction of functions.   Which of the following correctly represents the Laplace transform of ?     Correct! The linearity property allows you to multiply each function's Laplace transform by its corresponding constant.       No, the correct expression should be .

  "body": "Transforming Equations  Throughout this section, we learned how to apply Laplace transforms to individual functions. However, our goal is to solve differential equations, which means we need to understand how to transform an entire differential equation, including its initial conditions. This brings us back to the first step in the Laplace Transform Method roadmap.    Step 1: The Forward Laplace Transform    Our goal here is to apply the Laplace transform to both sides of this equation using the common transforms and properties we've discussed. Recall that applying a Laplace transform to a function can be thought of as multiplying the function by and integrating with respect to . However, instead of explicitly writing out this process for every term, we simply apply the Laplace operator, , to both sides of the equation. Let's break this down with an example.   Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem   First, apply to both sides of the equation , and use the linearity property,   , to split this into four separate transforms. For this example, we will look at each one individually.   Plugging back into the equation, we get     To further illustrate this process, consider one more example.   Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem .  Applying the Laplace transform to both sides gives:     In both examples, the differential equations have been transformed into algebraic equations, where solving for will be the next step in the Laplace Transform Roadmap.  Check-Point Questions  True-False: Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation transforms the equation into an algebraic equation in the s-domain.  True.

The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:   Summary of the Key Ideas     Differential Algebraic Equations . The Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation, simplifying the solution process by eliminating derivatives.   Laplace Transform Concept . Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation involves transforming each term by multiplying by and integrating with respect to from to , but is often simplified by directly applying the Laplace operator, .   Linearity Property . The Laplace transform is linear, meaning it distributes across addition and subtraction, and allows for constants to be factored out. This property is essential for transforming complex equations.   Transforming Initial Conditions . Initial conditions are incorporated directly into the Laplace-transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include initial values, making it easier to solve the resulting algebraic equation.   Common Function Transforms . The Laplace transforms of common functions, such as exponentials, sines, cosines, and polynomials, are essential tools in transforming differential equations and are summarized in the provided table.   Transforming Derivatives . The Laplace transform of a derivative, or higher, transfers the derivative onto the Laplace variable , reducing the order of the equation while introducing initial condition terms.   Multiplication by and . When multiplying a function by an exponential , the Laplace transform shifts by in the -domain, and multiplying by corresponds to differentiating the transform times with respect to , introducing a sign change.   Transforming the Entire Equation . The process of applying the Laplace transform to an entire differential equation with initial conditions involves systematically transforming each term and leads to a simplified algebraic equation in the -domain, ready for solving.

However, in practice, not all -functions will align perfectly with these forms. In fact, the most challenging part of the Laplace Transform Method lies in preparing the -function for the backward step. This process involves modifications of the function before matching the known forms in our table. In this discussion, we will cover some of the minor modifications that will need for the Laplace Transform Method.  Many of the forms in can be matched just by observing the denominator of the -function. The following table outlines the connection between the denominator and it associated transform.

This is done by multiplying the numerator and denominator by this constant as shown in the following examples.   Compute the inverse Laplace transforms for each.          The in the denominator tells us that we need . Before we do, let's factor out : .            Since the denominator has the form, , and there is no in the numerator, we should apply .

In these cases, you can usually split the fraction as the sum of these forms.   Compute the inverse Laplace transforms for each.          The key to this problem is to split the fraction into two separate terms: Notice the first term matches with and the second term matches with , so             We can split the fraction into the terms, and apply the inverse Laplace transform to each Therefore, the inverse transform is          This section explored two relatively minor modifications needed to match and find the backward Laplace transform.

However, there are other algebraic manipulations you can (and sometimes must!) do, so we look at more examples here.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As a general guideline, you are advised to consider the denominator when determining trying to determine which property or properties in the Laplace transform table might be appropriate. In this case, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator. None of the properties in the table looks exactly the same, but and do have second-degree polynomials in the denominator. We just need to make our expression look like the form of those denominators, This entails completing the square.  Margin note: if you need to review completing the square, look HERE.      Margin note: Notice that the sign on the 4 is positive. If the sign had been negative, this would not be a perfect match with the table and we'd have to use a different strategy.

Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As in the previous example, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, so we might try to make this expression match and\/or in the table. We begin by completing the square.   Now we have the denominator in a format so that it matches with or , but unlike the previous example, the numerator is not an exact match with either or . We note that the numerator does have an in it, so we will start by aiming to see if we can make it a match with . If we did have a perfect match with , then we would have in the numerator. Let's focus on the numerator for a moment and consider the following.   In order to make the expressions equal, what value would the have? If we distribute the three, we would have and thus it's clear that should be equal to . Let's use this to rewrite as follows.   The advantage to writing this way is that the first fraction is now a perfect match for . We need to find a perfect match for that second fraction. It looks close to , but not perfect. In order to be a perfect match for , we would need a 3 in the numerator. Luckily, we can multiply by one (in the form of in order to get a 3 in the numerator, as follows.   Now that we have done some algebraic manipulation, we are now ready to take the inverse Laplace transform.      Find    We complete the square in the denominator in the function   This does not immediately appear to match or , but we can actually write the denominator as and proceed as in the previous examples, working toward matching and .     In summary, when we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function with a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, we may complete the square or we may do a partial fraction decomposition. How will we know which is appropriate? Here are a few guidelines for you to consider.  Does the denominator factor in an obvious way? If so, factor the denominator and do a partial fraction decomposition if necessary.  If the denominator does not factor in an obvious way, try completing the square.  If you end up with addition outside of the parentheses, as in then you should aim to match and\/or .  If instead you end up with subtraction outside the parentheses, as in then you should factor and do a partial fraction decomposition. You may consider using the quadratic formula if the factorization is not obvious to you.  If you end up with no terms outside the parentheses, as in then use .    If you have a rational function where the denominator is of higher degree, then partial fraction decomposition should be used to break the single fraction into several simpler fractions.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of    Note that as the quadratic term in the denominator does not factor, the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor and a repeated linear factor. We'll proceed by simplifying this complicated fraction with a Partial Fraction Decomposition of the form   You may also consider using technology to find a partial fraction decomposition. You should get  Click here for the details.   With the partial fraction decomposition in hand, we are prepared to take the inverse Laplace transform, using the same types of algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the previous examples.     When we study Laplace Transforms, we will frequently want to manipulate an algebraic expression to make it match a given form.  If you prefer to see a video of this example, click here   Suppose we have the expression and we think it looks much like the form It's not a perfect match, though. Based on the denominator, we might guess   Notice that this would make the denominator a perfect match, However, the numerator still isn't quite right. It would be correct if we would multiply the numerator by 5. But if we multiply the numerator by 5, we would change the expression. In order to NOT change the expression, we will instead multiply by as follows: Notice that when we multiply by , we are just multiplying by one, so we don't change the value of the expression.  Check your Understanding   Compute .   Using the product rule, we have      As we progress through the Laplace Transform Method, the modifications required to match the s-function to a known form in the backward transform table become more intricate. One of the first major modifications we encounter is completing the square. This technique allows us to transform quadratic expressions in the denominator into a recognizable form that corresponds to the sine or cosine entries in the common Laplace transforms table.  Completing the square is a powerful tool when faced with quadratic expressions that don’t immediately match any of the standard forms. For example, if you see a quadratic expression like , you can use completing the square to rewrite it as something resembling . The key to recognizing when this technique is needed lies in the structure of the quadratic expression: if the quadratic has both linear and constant terms but cannot be factored easily, completing the square is often the next step.  The strategy is straightforward: first, identify the coefficient of the linear term, then use it to complete the square. Specifically, given a quadratic of the form , you would take half of the linear coefficient, square it, and add and subtract it within the expression. This transforms the quadratic into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant, making it easier to handle in the context of Laplace transforms.  Let's walk through a few examples to illustrate how completing the square can simplify the inverse Laplace transform process.   Rewrite by completing the square.  Start by taking half of the linear coefficient, , and squaring it to get . Then add and subtract inside the expression: Now, the expression is in a form that matches the cosine or sine entries in the Laplace transform table.     Rewrite by completing the square.  Take half of the linear coefficient, , and square it to get . Add and subtract : This expression now matches the standard form for inverse Laplace transforms involving sine or cosine.     Rewrite by completing the square.  Take half of the linear coefficient, , and square it to get . Add and subtract : This allows you to apply the inverse Laplace transform for sine or cosine functions.    Completing the square is an essential technique for transforming quadratic expressions that don't directly match a form in the table of common Laplace transforms. However, it's not the only strategy available. In the next subsection, we'll explore another important technique: partial fraction decomposition. This method is useful for breaking down complex fractions into simpler components that can each be matched with forms in the Laplace transform table.  In the previous subsections, we discussed minor modifications that could be made to the -function in order to match it with a known form in the backward Laplace transform table. However, not all modifications are as simple. One such modification is completing the square in the denominator of an expression. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with quadratic expressions in the denominator that don't immediately fit a recognizable form in the Laplace transform table.  The goal of completing the square is to rewrite the quadratic expression in a form that can be matched with a sine or cosine Laplace transform. This typically involves expressing the quadratic as , which corresponds to the standard forms for the inverse transforms of sine and cosine functions.  Recognizing when completing the square is necessary usually comes down to noticing a quadratic expression in the denominator that doesn't factor easily or match any of the simple forms. In these cases, completing the square becomes a powerful tool to transform the expression into a usable form.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   To solve this, we first complete the square in the denominator. The quadratic expression can be rewritten as: Now, the expression for becomes: This matches the form of the cosine Laplace transform, so we apply the inverse Laplace transform:      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   First, complete the square in the denominator: Now, the expression becomes: The numerator does not exactly match the standard form, so we decompose it: Applying the inverse Laplace transform gives:      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   Completing the square in the denominator: The expression becomes: We can decompose the numerator: Applying the inverse Laplace transform gives:     Completing the square is a crucial technique when working with quadratic expressions in the denominator of Laplace transforms. It allows us to rewrite the expression in a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms, making the backward transformation process more manageable. In the next subsection, we will explore another essential technique: partial fraction decomposition, which helps in breaking down more complex fractions into simpler components that can be easily transformed.

We take the Laplace transform of the DE, and the result is an algebraic equation in terms of the variable and a function . We then solve for using algebra. Finally, we get our desired solution by taking the inverse Laplace transform, as shown in figure (Figure number).      (for accessibility)    Before we solve any DEs with this new solution technique, we need to practice the pieces of the solution technique. Thus, we dedicate the next couple of sections on learning what the Laplace transform is, how to find the Laplace transform of a function, and how to take the inverse Laplace transform of a function.

  "body": "Solving DEs via Laplace Transforms  So far we've learned the definition of Laplace transform, developed a table so that we could more easily find Laplace transforms, and then figured out how to use the table to take inverse Laplace transforms. We are finally ready to use all of this to actually solve some DEs. First, let's refer once more to the roadmap .  Before we begin, we should take note of when it's appropriate to use this technique. We can use Laplace transforms to solve DEs that are linear, have constant coefficients, and for which we have initial conditions. (We can relax this last condition if we want to, but for the most part we will focus on solving initial value problems.)   Solve the following initial value problem.    We intend to use Laplace transforms to solve this IVP, but we need to verify that this is an appropriate technique. We can verify that this is  the DE is linear,  the DE has constant coefficients, and  initial conditions are .    Hence, it is appropriate to proceed with the Laplace transform solution technique. We also note that is the dependent variable and is the independent variable, so our goal is to find a function that satisfies the DE and the initial conditions.   Margin note: We could actually use the method of undetermined coefficients. You are encouraged to do this and verify that the solution is the same.   Following the diagram , we begin by taking the Laplace transform of the DE. Let's look at some of the individual pieces.  We will need to take the Laplace transform of . Keep in mind that while it is not explicitly written, we do know that is a function of , so this could be written For the first time, we will use , being careful with our naming convention.   Similarly,   We also need to be careful about taking the Laplace transform of itself. Since is our unknown function, we don't know what we get when we take its Laplace transform, The only thing we can do is use the naming convention we have established: the Laplace transform of a function is the function That is,     With these facts in mind, we proceed to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the DE, using linearity as needed.

In particular, we are going to need to find the partial fraction decomposition of the rational function. First we note that the quadratic expression is irreducible, confirmed by the addition outside the parentheses when we complete the square (which we will use later).

For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume that is the independent variable and that is the dependent variable. We solve via the Laplace transform as follows.

  "title": "Unit Step Functions",
  "body": " Unit Step Functions  The two solution techniques we have been studying most recently (the Method of Undetermined Coefficients and solution via Laplace transforms) can be used to solve DEs that are linear and have constant coefficients. Recall, however, that we would not be able to use the Method of Undetermined Coefficients to solve DEs where the nonhomogeneous function is discontinuous. We will be able to use Laplace transforms to solve such DEs, but we first need to understand the unit step function , which will be used to rewrite discontinuous functions in a particular way.  make a definition box for the unit step function. add a graph  We begin by introducing the definition of the standard unit step function. The unit step function , , is defined to be    For the unit step function defined above, complete the following:  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate , where is a positive constant  evaluate , where is a negative constant  Sketch        Since the input to the unit step function, , is positive,  Similarly, since the input to the function is positive,  The input to the function is negative, so  If is any positive constant, then  If is any negative constant, then  Sketch:   How about this?         Re-word this and\/or move it near the definition. Compare to e^x as well as sine.  It's important to remember that from this point forward, that the unit step function is well-defined. There is only one unit step function, , in the same way that there is only one sine function, We will now build on the definition to learn more about how this function behaves.   Consider the function and complete the following:  evaluate .  evaluate .  evaluate .  evaluate where .  evaluate where .  Sketch  Write as a piecewise defined function.        Notice that . Since the input to the unit step function is negative, we have   Similar to the previous question, . In this case, the input to the unit step function is positive, so we have   As in the previous two questions, we evaluate as follows.   Suppose If we substitute into the function , we have In order to evaluate this, we need to know if the input to the unit step function, , is positive or negative. Since we know that is positive, and therefore   Suppose now that If we substitute into the function , we have Since we know that the input to the unit step function, , is negative, and therefore                  This result is consistent with our understanding of shifting functions. That is, if we want to sketch the graph of the function then we can shift the graph of three units to the right. Another way to think about this is that the function changes its behavior at (in that its output is 0 when the input variable is less than 3 and its output is 1 when the input variable is greater than 3).  Using this same line of thinking, if we can surmise that changes behavior at .   Sketch the function     Based on our knowledge of unit step functions, we know that changes behavior at    If we choose -values such that : then is negative, so and therefore    If we choose -values such that : then is positive, so and therefore     Thus, we can sketch the function as shown below.       Let's reflect on what happened. For the function the 2 indicates that the function changes behavior at and the 3 changes the amplitude of the nonzero portion of the function.  Move turning on  Another useful way to think about unit step functions is to think about them as being on or off. For example, has a value of zero, or is 'turned off', when , and when  has a value of 1, or is 'turned on'. Framing unit step functions this way may be helpful as we move forward and consider more complicated functions.   Sketch the function and write it as a piecewise defined function.    We can begin by identifying -values where the function changes behavior. We know that changes behavior at and changes behavior at so will change behavior at both and These -values break the -number line into three regions: (1) , (2) and (3)        If we choose -values such that (red):   is negative, so  is negative, so    How about this for formatting the analysis?  Therefore, when (red), we have     If we choose -values such that : then is positive, so and is negative, so Therefore when     If we choose -values such that : then is positive, so and is positive, so Therefore when      Thus, we can sketch the function as shown below.     The piecewise defined function representation of is     What lessons can we take away from this example? When both of the unit step functions are 'turned off', so the only thing contributing to the function is the constant term, At the first unit step function, 'turns on', and the result is a jump discontinuity in the graph of the function at and the function jumps from a value of to a value of   The function changes behavior next at , when the function 'turns on' and therefore the function jumps from the previous value of to its final value of    Consider the function .  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate  Sketch the graph of  Write as a piecewise defined function.                  We can begin by identifying -values where the function changes behavior. We know that changes behavior at and changes behavior at so will change behavior at both and These -values break the -number line into three regions: (1) , (2) and (3) (INSERT A SMALL PICTURE OF A NUMBER LINE IN THE MARGIN HERE?)

We can write as a piecewise defined function as follows.       Let's step back again and see what we can generalize from this example. Notice that this function had a value of for Then the unit step function became relevant, but because its coefficient was , it had the effect of 'turning off' the that was already present. It can be helpful for us moving forward to be able to think about negative coefficients as 'turning off' a function.  This is also the first example that demonstrates a non-constant coefficient. Notice that it behaves no differently than a constant coefficient; the unit step function served to turn the function on after    Sketch the function     We first identify where the function will change behavior. In this case, it will change behavior only at We can then think about the functions behavior for and for Notice that when  and therefore When  and then we have This means we could write as the following piecewise defined function, and sketch it .

This was an important step for us as we got used to unit step functions, but we what we really need is to be able to do the opposite of what we have been doing in the previous section: when given a piecewise defined function, we need to be able to write the function in terms of unit step functions. Once we have this skill, we will focus on taking Laplace transforms involving unit step functions, which we will need when we solve DEs.   Sketch the function and then write the function in terms of unit step functions.  (include a sketch of the function here)    The first thing we want to take note of is for what -values the function changes behavior. This function changes behavior at and we will use a unit step function to help us capture that change in behavior, so we need a unit step function that has a discontinuity at That is, we know we need at Thus, the form of our function is   Now we need only determine what goes in the blanks. When the unit step function will have a value of zero. We also know that when  Therefore the first blank must be That is,   When  and Thus we have   In order to make the equation true, it must be that the function that goes in the line is so that we have   This makes sense because when we \"turn off\" the function and \"turn on\" the function.

  "body": "Solving Polynomial Equations  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so Therefore,    Possible Rational Roots  There is a theorem that tells us potential fractional roots of the polynomial. If is a solution, then must be of the form . This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.        Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.  By combining these techniques, we can solve for the roots of any higher-degree polynomial. Once we have the roots, we can construct the general solution to the higher-order LHCC equation.  For a higher-order LHCC equation like: , the characteristic equation is the polynomial equation we just discussed. Finding the roots of this polynomial gives us the general solution: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.  Let's see an example to solidify these concepts.  Solving a Third-Degree Polynomial Equation   Find the general solution to the third-order LHCC equation:       First, write down the characteristic equation: . Factoring the polynomial, we get: . Therefore, the roots are .  Since we have three distinct real roots, the general solution to the LHCC equation is: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.    Polynomail Division  Use polynomial divison to compute                                                                                     Therefore, .   "
