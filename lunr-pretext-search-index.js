  "title": "Linearity",
  "body": "Linearity  Recognizing the distinction between linear and nonlinear differential equations is crucial. The linearity of terms naturally leads to the general concept of linearity, and the previous section has equipped us well for this important task.   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be written as If one of the terms is not linear, then the differential equation is nonlinear .   This definition may seem a bit overwhelming, but it is intended to represent all possible linear differential equations. As the examples will show, most equations you encounter will only have a few terms and our approach will be to find just one of them that is not linear. If we can't, then the equation is linear.   Determine if the following differential equation is linear.  .  To answer this question, we need either to verify that all the terms are linear or find one term that is not linear. Let's rewrite this equation like and check each term one-by-one. Since every term is linear, this differential equation is linear.    Check your Understanding   Linear or Nonlinear?

  "body": "General Solution Parts  As discussed in the last section, every solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation must account for the non-zero term on the right-hand side. However, hidden within these solutions could be terms that cancel out with each other instead of contributing to the term on the right-hand side.  To see this, let's bring back the equation from the last section, , which we know has as a solution. Would it still be a solution if we tossed another term, say , onto it so that ? To find out, we plug it in and track this new term (in blue), like so   There is a lot built into this result, so let's carefully break it down.   First, is a solution since it satisfies .    The solution contains the two parts , where part (1) contains the terms that simplifies to and part (2) contains the terms that simplify to when plugged into .    The third step looks like and were separately plugged into . As long as the equation is linear, this separation can happen.      This example illustrates the following general principle of LNCC equations.

The homogeneous part, , that gives , is found by solving using the characteristic equation, as follows . So the homogeneous part is and the general solution is given by     Before we can start solving these equations, we still need a strategy for finding the particular solution, .

  "body": "Adjusting Forms  Everything we have done up to this point has been geared toward solving linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations where the right-hand side contains some combination of polynomial, exponential, sine, and cosine functions. However, there is one last detail that we still need to address. In particular, we need to know what to do when the selected form of has overlapping like-terms with the homogeneous solution, . In this section we will explain why this is a problem and how to fix it.  To illustrate this concept, note that the differential equation . has a particular solution of the form . Plugging it in gives which leads to an obvious problem. Recall that the parts of an LNCC general solution tells you that if simplifies to , then it must be part of the homogeneous solution!  Now, let's attempt to find a particular solution, . Since the right-hand side of the original equation is , we might initially guess: However, this term is already part of the homogeneous solution, . If we use this guess, we will not obtain a valid particular solution because it will be absorbed into the homogeneous part. To circumvent this, we adjust our guess by multiplying by to ensure linear independence:      Let's verify if this adjusted guess works by plugging it into the original equation. We find the necessary derivatives:   Substituting these into the differential equation: Simplifying, we get:   This simplifies to: Thus, we find:   Therefore, the particular solution is:   This example demonstrates the importance of adjusting the form of when it overlaps with . In general, if our initial guess for contains any term that is also part of , we multiply that term by to ensure independence. If the overlap persists, we multiply by higher powers of (e.g., , ) until the terms are linearly independent.  This adjustment process ensures that our particular solution remains valid and that we can correctly solve the differential equation. By recognizing when to adjust , we refine our approach to handling linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations effectively.  Check your Understanding   Needs to be written   OK     "
