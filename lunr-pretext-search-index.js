  "body": "An Analogy  When you're learning something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for :       All three are equations with the same goal—finding the unknown . However, only the third equation is a differential equation because it contains a derivative.  Now, let's try solving for in each case.             In the first equation, we found that is a number, and in the second, it's a function of . But in the third equation, how do we solve for when there is a derivative attached to it? This is exactly the kind of question that differential equations aim to answer.  We'll dive deeper into solving these types of equations soon. For now, there's still plenty more to learn about the basics, so let's keep going!

Think of the order of a differential equation as the number of layers or steps you need to peel away to reveal the original function. The more layers there are, the higher the order, and usually, the more complex the equation.   The order of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative that appears in the equation. For example, if the highest derivative is the first derivative, it's called a first-order differential equation. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, it's called a second-order differential equation, and so on.    Give the order of the following differential equations:          Order = 1.

While linearity often refers to equations that graph as straight lines, the concept of linearity in differential equations is more nuanced. Understanding this distinction is crucial as it significantly influences how the equations are solved and interpreted.  Before jumping in, it may be helpful to revisit meaning of dependent variables, terms and coefficients as we will be referencing them throughout this discussion.  Now, let's define what it means for a term in a differential equation to be linear.  Linear Term    Linear Term  A term that has one of the forms     where is the dependent variable.

  "body": "Linearity  In the world of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is vital. This distinction will often guide you on how to approach solving the equation and what methods to use. The good news is, all the work we did in the previous section will make this task much easier.   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be expressed as If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is nonlinear .   This definition might seem abstract at first, but it encompasses all possible linear differential equations. In practice, most equations you'll encounter will involve only a few terms, and the challenge lies in identifying whether any of those terms break the rule of linearity. If they do, the equation is nonlinear.   Let's determine whether the following differential equation is linear:   To classify this equation, we need to verify if every term involving and its derivatives is linear. Let's break it down term by term:   Since each term involving or its derivatives is linear, this differential equation is indeed linear.

They describe how quantities change over time or space.     An Analogy   Like standard equations, differential equations aim to solve for an unknown, but this unknown is a function rather than a number.     Dependent & Independent Variables   Differential equations involve both dependent (unknown function) and independent variables.  The derivatives in the equation apply to the dependent variable.     Terms & Coefficients   Terms in a differential equation are separated by , , or signs.  Coefficients are constants or functions that multiply the dependent variable or its derivatives.     Order of a Differential Equation   The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative present.     Linearity of a Differential Equation   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear combinations of the dependent variable and its derivatives.  Otherwise, it is nonlinear.

  "body": "What is a Solution?  Regardless what kind of equation you are working with, a solution is a value or function that satisfies the equation. The term satisfies simply means that when you plug the value into the equation, it simplifies to a statement that is undeniably true. This undeniably true statement is sometimes called an identity. For example, suppose I want to check if and are solutions to the equation . To do this, we verify that both and  satisfy the equation by separately plugging and in for each , simplify and see if we end up with an undeniably true statement, like so        Since yields a true statement we say it satisfies the equation and is a solution. In contrast, does not give a true statement, so it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.  The same idea applies to differential equations, except in that solutions to differential equations are functions instead of numbers . To see this, let's verify if and are solutions to the differential equation .  Separately plugging and into the equation yields        Since results in a false statement, it does not satisfy the equation and is not a solution.

For example, later on in this text, we will show that the differential equation has the general solution While the general solution gives us a family of possible solutions, in practical scenarios, we are usually interested in the specific solution where the constants are known. This is where initial conditions come into play—they allow us to determine the particular solution that applies to the problem at hand.  An initial condition is a starting value of the solution or its derivatives. For example, consider the free fall of an object due to gravity where is the position (distance from the ground) of this object at time . Assuming the ball is dropped from the top of a 100 ft building, what initial information do you know? Let be the time when the ball is dropped, then the initial conditions are given in the following table.  The following table summarizes the initial conditions for our example, highlighting the key information required to determine the particular solution:       Information at  Initial Condition    The ball is at the top of a 100 ft building.     The ball is dropped from rest (initial velocity is zero).      Without these initial conditions, the solution is incomplete and not applicable to any specific scenario. Assuming the solution must be consistent with these conditions forces the constants in the general solution to take specific values, giving us a particular solution.   Solve the initial value problem .  Since we already know the general solution to is given by . If you are interested in the verification steps, see the solution below.  Verification as a solution  First find :   and substitute these into and simplify: Which shows and so is a solution.   We would like determine the spcific values of and that correspond to the initial conditions and .  Since one initial condition involves the derivative, we will need to compute this before applying this condition.   Now let's apply the initial conditions:   We now have two equations and two unknowns, There are multiple ways to solve this system of equations, and the reader is encouraged to verify that and . Here is one Solving for and We will solve for in the first equation and then substitute into the second.    Thus, the solution we that satisfies the DE and both of the provided initial conditions is      Solve the initial value problem Given that the general solution is .  The initial condition, , tells us that must equal 2 when is 0 . When we substitute and into the general solution, we see that we can solve for .   Therefore, forces and we get the particular solution .    Initial conditions can also be visualized. the initial condition, , is shown as the point on the -axis. The blue curve is the particular solution we found above and is the only solution in the family that passes through this point.      In the graph, the point on the -axis is the initial condition. You can change the initial condition by dragging the point up and down along the -axis.   As you drag the point, make the following observations:   Each new value of gives a new value of , which corresponds to a new particular solution (blue curve).  Only one particular solution from the family of solutions (green curves) passes through the initial condition.       The family of solutions (green curves) and a particular solution (blue curve) passing through .     In summary, the process of solving a differential equation typically begins with finding a general solution.

  "body": "Summary & Exercises   Summary of the Key Ideas     What is a Solution?   A solution to a differential equation is a function that, when substituted into the equation, satisfies the equation.     Verifying Solutions   Verification of a solution involves substituting the function into the equation and simplifying to check if a true statement is obtained.  To verify a solution, all terms should ideally be moved to one side of the equation, simplifying the process.     Types of Solutions   Differential equations can have different types of solutions: general and particular.  The general solution includes arbitrary constants and represents a family of solutions.  A particular solution is obtained by assigning specific values to these constants.     Initial Conditions   Initial conditions are values given for the solution or its derivatives at a specific point, often used to find a particular solution.  They help specify which member of the general solution family is applicable in a specific context.         Discuss the difference between a general solution, family of solutions, and a particualr solution.  Given the differential equation determine if the following functions are solutions of this differential equation.    a.   b.   c.     d.   e.   f.     g.   h.   i.        a. No  b. Yes  c. Yes    d. No  e. No  f. No    g. Yes  h. Yes  i.

Yes      Match each function on the left with a DE on the right if this function is a solution (i.e. is in the family of solutions) for this DE.

Find the value of the constant in order for the differential equation to have the solution .    Is a solution of the differential equation  Yes  Find the value of    For each of the differential equations and function pairs, find all the possible values of such that the function is a solution to the DE.                      Explain the significance of initial condition(s) as they relate to the general solution of a differential equation.  The initial condition(s) specify one or more points that the graph of the solution must pass through. This often allows one to solve for the constants in the general solution.  Therefore, the initial condition(s) act to reduce the family of solutions down to a smaller set of solutions or, ideally, a single particular solution.   Does an initial condition always give you a particular solution?  When there is one constant in the general solution, yes.  When there is more than one constant in the general solution, no.  It does, however, limit the possible values of the constants.   Consider the differential equation   Verify that the family of functions a solution to this differential equation.  Find the particular solution that corresponds to the initial condition .    Yes   , so is the particular solution   Consider the differential equation Which of the following is a family of solutions for this DE?        Find the particular solution such that .  b.   , so is the particular solution   Try first.  Compute       So for this function, it is not the solution.  Now try . Then   while   So this function is the solution  Setting we get   Solve for c,  So the solution for the IVP is   Understanding what it means to Solve a DE   We spend a lot of time solving equations, but do you even remember what it means to be a solution? Let's review what it means to be a solution to an algebraic equation (as in question ), and then what it means to be a solution to a differential equation (as in question ), and then we'll extend those ideas in questions and .   Verify that is a solution to the equation  What confirms that is a solution? the LHS = RHS after substituting into both sides of the equation.  ( Note: Do not rearrange the equation to solve for . That would be the process of finding a solution; you are asked to verify a solution. ) Since we get the same result (21) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the equation. We substitute into the left hand side (LHS) of the equation, and then into the right hand side (RHS) of the equation: Since we get the same result when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we have confirmed that is a solution to the equation.  Verify that is a solution to the DE  Look back at the previous question and think about what it means to be a solution to a DE. Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that is a solution to the DE. We need to substitute into the DE. In order to substitute into the left hand side, we need to know the second derivative. So we begin by finding that. Now we can substitute into the DE: Since when we substitute in to the DE, we find that the LHS is equal to the RHS, we have verified that is a solution to the DE   Consider the DE  Find all values of such that is a solution to the DE by taking derivatives and substituting into the DE, and then solving for .  no matter the value of or Therefore we might want to factor it out as it won't contribute to our answer.   First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE and solve for : Recall that no matter the value of or Thus we have: So the two solutions are   Now that you have (hopefully!) two values for choose one of the two values and then verify that is a solution for that value of  Since we get the same result (0) when we substitute the solution into the RHS and into the LHS, we confirm that (or ) is a solution to the DE.  The work here is for and the work for is similar.  First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Hence, we have shown that is a solution to the DE     Assuming the form of the solution of DE.  Find all values of such that is a solution of the DE     We proceed as in the previous question. First we take derivatives so that we can substitute into the DE. Now we can substitute into the DE: Note that there is no value of that can guarantee that is 0. Hence we have So the two solutions are      "

Sometimes, it requires some algebra to rearrange the equation into a form where the method can be applied.  Separation of Variables (SOV)  If a differential equation can be written in the separable form , then the general solution can be determined through the steps below.   Step 1: Separate      Step 2: Integrate      Step 3: Isolate  Isolate (if possible), and combine constants.

Note: since, in general , we CANNOT simplify the solution to                For the integral on the left hand side, we will need to do a substitution.

Applications  A 4-lb roast, initially at , is placed in a oven at 5:00 PM After 75 minutes it is found that the temperature of the roast is F. When will the roast be (medium rate)?   We take time in minutes, with corresponding to 5:00 PM We also assume (somewhat unrealistically) that at any instant the temperature of the roast is uniform throughout. We have , , and . Hence Now , implies that , so . We also know that when . Substitution of these values in the preceding equation yields Hence we finally solve the equation for (min), the total cooking time required.Because the roast was placed in the oven at 5:00 PM, it it should be removed at about 6:45 PM   Conceptual Questions  Explain why separating variables works as a method for solving ordinary differential equations.  Separation of variables works by isolating all terms involving to one side and all terms involving to the other. When this can be done, both sides can be integrated independently, allowing for the solution of the differential equation. This method effectively transforms the problem of solving a differential equation into the simpler task of integrating functions.   Why is it important for the equation to be \"separable\" in order to use the method of separation of variables? What does it mean for a differential equation to be separable?  For the method of separation of variables to be used, we must be able to write the differential equation in the form , effectively separating the variables and onto different sides of the equation. When a differential equation can be written in this way, it is called separable. Separability is crucial because it allows us to integrate each side with respect to its own variable, leading to a solution for in terms of .   Provide an example of a differential equation that is not separable and explain why the method of separation of variables cannot be applied to it.     In solving a differential equation using separation of variables, why might the constant of integration appear on both sides of the resulting equation?  After separating variables, we integrate both sides of the equation. Each integration will typically introduce its own constant of integration. Therefore, when we combine the results of these integrations, we often see a constant on both sides. These constants can often be combined into a single constant by subtracting one from the other.   Some differential equations solved using separation of variables yield implicit solutions, while others yield explicit solutions. Explain the difference between implicit and explicit solutions, and provide examples of each.     True\/False: Every first-order ordinary differential equation can be solved using the method of separation of variables.       Which of the following differential equations is not separable?           True\/False: If a differential equation is separable, its solution will always be an explicit function of .     The process of writing a differential equation in the form is called _________ of variables.     Which of the following cannot be directly solved by separation of variables?           True\/False: The method of separation of variables can be directly applied to higher-order differential equations.     True\/False: If you can write a differential equation in the form , then it is separable.     A differential equation of the form without a term:   Is always separable  Is never separable  Can be separable depending on  Is an implicit equation      A structured exercise   Here is where we give the student the background information required to start accomplishing tasks.  Solve a separable DE using separation of variables.                   The second step to do. We'll be lazy and just include an answer.   Just the answer.   A little wrap up.    "

  "body": "Product Rule  The integrating factor method relies on an essential calculus concept: the product rule for derivatives. Since this rule is at the heart of the method, let's take a moment to review it and see how it helps transform a differential equation into one that can be directly integrated.  The product rule is used to compute the derivative of a product of two functions. In the context of solving first-order linear differential equations, we use the product rule in reverse to combine terms involving the dependent and independent variables. This allows us to rewrite the equation as the derivative of a product, making integration straightforward. Let's begin by recalling the two directions of the product rule.  Suppose and are differentiable functions. The product rule states that The forward version goes from left to right, while the backward version, which we'll focus on, goes from right to left. Let's practice applying both versions with a few examples.   Compute each derivative.        Using the forward product rule , we have          Using the forward product rule , we have         Rewrite each expression in the form .

Therefore, the differential equation can be rewritten as .  Do you see that direct integration can be used here to solve the differential equation?    This example shows how reversing the product rule allows us to reduce a differential equation to a form that is easy to integrate.

  "title": "The Integrating Factor",
  "body": "The Integrating Factor  In the previous section, we introduced the idea of solving first-order linear differential equations by manipulating the equation into a form that allows direct integration. This process involved applying a backward product rule to make the left-hand side a perfect derivative. However, most equations are not in the form to do this directly. Instead, there is a missing piece, called the integrating factor that is required for transformation to take place and is the focus of this section.  To see this missing piece, lets consider the differential equation: . We would like to apply the backward product rule to the left side, but it seems to be missing something. Let's try to figure out what this missing piece is by multipying both sides by something: . With this missing piece and the fact that and appear in the equation, we should be able to rewrite the equation as: . To determine what this missing piece is, we need to see where (start) and (goal) meet in the middle. This is shown below.  Notice, the two middle equations agree everywhere except for the expressions in blue. In order for the start and goal equations to be the same, these expressions must match. In other words, the piece that we need to get must satisfy . But, this is the differential equation where is the unknown!    (for accessibility)      Solving this requires you to notice that it is separable and a quick calculation shows that is the solution. Therefore, if you multiply both sides of by , you can use the backward product rule to write the equation as , which can then be solved by direct integration .  The function, , that allowed us to rewrite the equation is called the integrating factor . The general form for this factor is outlined as follows.  The Integrating Factor   The integrating factor for the first-order linear differential equation is . Multiplying both sides by transforms the equation into: .   Derivation of the Integrating Factor  Note, all first-order linear differential equations can be written in the form , where and are functions of . The goal is to write the left-side as a single derivative. However, backward product rule is missing a piece, , that we still need to find. We find by multiplying it onto , like so            Check your Understanding   What is the main purpose of an integrating factor?   What is the main purpose of an integrating factor in solving first-order linear differential equations?    To transform the equation into one that can be solved using the backward product rule.   Correct! The integrating factor allows us to manipulate the equation so that it becomes a perfect derivative, which can then be integrated directly.     To simplify the coefficients of the equation.   Not quite. While the integrating factor simplifies the process, its primary goal is to enable the use of the backward product rule, not to simplify the coefficients directly.     To eliminate the constant term from the differential equation.   Incorrect. The integrating factor is used to transform the equation into a solvable form, not to remove constant terms.     To reduce the equation to a second-order differential equation.   Incorrect. The integrating factor helps solve first-order differential equations, not reduce them to second-order equations.      Which of the following is the differential equation for the integrating factor ?   Which differential equation do you solve to find the integrating factor, , for the first-order linear equation ?        Incorrect. Try again.         Correct!         Incorrect. Try again.         Incorrect. Try again.      What form does the first-order linear differential equation take after multiplying by the integrating factor?   After multiplying both sides of a first-order linear differential equation by the integrating factor, the equation takes the form:        Correct! Multiplying by the integrating factor transforms the equation into this form.         Incorrect. The correct form is .         Incorrect. This is the form of the original equation before multiplying by the integrating factor.         Incorrect. This form does not represent the transformed equation after multiplying by the integrating factor.      What is the integrating factor for the equation ?   Find the integrating factor for the equation .        Incorrect. This is not the correct expression for the integrating factor.         Correct! The integrating factor is .         Incorrect. The correct integrating factor should involve the integral of the coefficient of , which is , not .         Incorrect. This is not the correct form for the integrating factor.      If we solve a differential equation to find the integrating factor, then why doesn't it contain an integration constant?   When solving a differential equation to find the integrating factor, why is there no constant of integration in the solution?    Since any value of this constant would give a valid integrating factor, we set the constant to the simplest value.   Correct! The integrating factor is used to multiply both sides of the equation, and any constant would cancel out during this process, making the constant irrelevant.

  "body": "Integrating Factor Method  The integrating factor method uses a three-step strategy to solve first-order linear differential equations in the standard form :  Every linear differential equation looks like . The first-order version of this is , but we can divide both sides of this equation by : . Since every first-order linear differential equation can always be written as , we call this the first-order linear standard form .   . The heart of this method is the first step: finding the correct integrating factor. The second step uses this factor to write the left side as a single derivative. Finally, the last step finds the solution by direct integration .  Step 1: Finding the Integrating Factor  Understanding how to find the integrating factor is crucial. Let's carefully walk through this important process.  Consider the differential equations (specific on the left, general on the right):   ,   .  We would like to rewrite the left side as a single derivative using the backward product rule . However, the alone suggests there is a missing second function that the product rule needs. Maybe there is a function that we can multiply both sides of the equation by to get the desired product rule. Let's call it for now and see if we can find it. We start by multiplying both sides by :   .   .  Notice that the left side almost looks like the product rule , except for the boxed value where should be (see below).   ,   .  This shows that the that works is the one that satisfies      .  Careful inspection shows that these are separable differential equations where the unknown can be found using separation of variables!        Although the solution conatains a constant, we only need one function that works, so we set . The function is called the integrating factor and finding it is the first step toward solving a first order differential equation.  The Integrating Factor  The integrating factor for the first-order linear differential equation   is given by and represents the function, when multiplied onto both sides of the equation, needed to write the left side as a derivative.    Step 2: Rewriting the Equation With the integrating factor in hand, we are ready to write the left side as a derivative using the backward product rule .  Integrating Factor:    Integrating Factor:  .    Step 3: Solving the Equation  The final step is to apply direct integration . This was covered in a previous section, so we will skip some of the details here.       where .    General Solution  The general solution for the first-order linear differential equation   is given by where is the integrating factor.     In summary, the integrating factor method is a three-step process that utilizes the integrating factor to rewrite the left side of the equation, enabling direct integration and leading to the general solution.

  "body": "IF: Step-By-Step  Now that we are familiar with the strategy behind the integrating factor method, let's streamline the process into a sequence of steps, summarized below.  Integrating Factor  The general solution to the first-order linear DE in the standard form can be determined through the following steps:  Step 1: Find the Integrating Factor  .  Step 2: Rewrite the DE  Multiply the equation by , and rewrite it in the form    Step 3: Apply Direct Integration Integrate both sides of and solve for .     Now let's apply this to some examples.    Find the general solution to the differential equation  .    .    .   Multiply by :       Rewrite:               Solve    We always begin by classifying the DE. You should confirm that this DE is first order and linear, and therefore it is appropriate to use our integrating factor technique. Keep in mind that our goal is to find an unknown function that satisfies this equation.  We work first to get the DE in an appropriate form so that we can un-do the product rule. We begin by getting the dependent variable, and its derivative on the same side of the equation, and then we multiply both sides of the equation by so that the coefficient on the derivative is 1.   If follow the process we took in the previous example, we would first multiply by the unknown function that will help us un-do the product rule, then we would determine . Instead, let's first determine , and then we'll multiply by it. As in ( ), we need to identify the function that is attached to the independent variable by multiplication. In equation ( ), we have , (note the inclusion of the negative sign) so we know that the function that will help us un-do the product rule is given by (Note, again, that we seek only one function , so we omit the absolute value and the that we normally see when we integrate the function )  While our integrating factor is technically correct, it can (and should) be simplified using rules of logarithms as follows.   We'll end up using lots of rules of logarithms throughout this chapter; review those rules (HERE) if you need a refresher.  Now that we have identified the integrating factor , we can multiply both sides of the DE (which we put in standard form in ( )) by it.   If we have correctly determined the integrating factor, then we should be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side. Notice that we can identify the functions and as follows.   It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   We've made a big step forward, here! Remember that our goal is to find the unknown function , so we are much closer since we appears in only one place in this equation. In order to un-do the differentiation, we can integrate both sides of the equation.   Finally, we can solve for by multiplying both sides of the equation by    We have made a point of simplifying whenever possible, and you should look to do that as you work. You may be tempted to replace the with a single constant; remember, however, that a constant times a function is not a constant, so we cannot simplify that last term any further.  Hence, we have found the solution to the DE. We can always verify our solution by substituting back in to the original DE. This is optional, but the details are included here.       Solve the following initial value problem.    As always, we begin by identifying the independent and dependent variables and classifying the DE.  independent variable:   dependent variable:   order: first order  linearity: linear  goal: solve for the unknown function     Since this DE is first order and linear, we can use the integrating factor technique. We begin to put the DE in standard form for this technique by getting the dependent variable and its derivative on the left hand side of the equals sign.   Next we want to make the coefficient on the term equal to 1. We can divide by , which is equivalent to multiplying by    Now we can identify the function , which consists of whatever is attached to the dependent variable by multiplication. In this case, . Then we find as follows.   (As before, we need only one integrating factor , so we omit the we normally see when we evaluate an indefinite integral).  Once we have identified our integrating factor, we can multiply both sides of the DE in its standard form (as in equation ( )) by the function .   If we have correctly determined the integrating factor , we should be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side. We can identify the functions and below:   It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   Our goal is to solve for . Since it is currently inside the derivative, we will integrate both sides of the equation.   In order to evaluate the integral on the right hand side, we can make the substitution , which means that , or equivalently .   Now we can solve for .   Finally, we need to apply the initial condition we are provided so that we can determine the constant .   We can then write the particular solution to the initial value problem.   As usual, we can check our answer by substituting back into the original DE. While this step is not required, it is always a good idea to check and we include the details here.       Consider the following DE.    First we note that this equation is first order and linear.  Our first step would be to move closer to seeing the form shown in . As such, we will put the terms containing the derivative, , and the function, , on the same of the equation.   In an ideal world, we would immediately be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side of the equation. Unfortunately, this doesn't work right now, so we need to do a little work to force it to work. %Obviously this sentence is awful. We would still like to push this into the form shown in ( ), so we can first divide the entire equation by the coefficient on , and then multiply by the function that will help us un-do the product rule.   In Example 6, we showed that the function we need is given by . We need only identify the function as in ( ). For this DE, we have . Take special note of the inclusion of the negative sign. Hence, we have   Note that we have assumed that the constant of integration is zero because we know we need just one function , and we choose the simplest one. Now we can replace the replace the 's in Equation ( ) with to yield   If we've done everything correctly so far, we should be able to undo the product rule on the left hand side. We can identify functions and as follows:   We need to verify at this step that if we take the derivative of , we do actually get the expression we've labeled as . In this case, we do get , as expected, so we have correctly determined the function that will help us un-do the product rule. This function, that plays a central role in this solution technique, is called the integrating factor .  We have identified how we can un-do the product rule so now we need to do just that.   We have just made a huge step forward in solving this DE! We have made it so that the unknown function now appears in the equation only once, so we can now work to solve for . As it stands, the function is inside a derivative, so we can integrate both sides (with respect to the independent variable).   The integration and differentiation will un-do each other on the left hand side. On the right hand side, we need a substitution, , in order to achieve the integration. This means , or equivalently    We are almost done; we need only divide both sides of the equation by to solve for .   While the equation above is a valid solution, we may prefer to rewrite the second term using rules of exponents to yield   We have now found the general solution to the DE. As always, we can verify that we have found the correct solution by substituting back into the original DE. %Put this in a collapsible?    Since we get the same result when we substitute our solution in on the right and left hand sides of the DE, we confirm that we did find the solution.    Check your Understanding   "

It is critical that you verify that the function does, in fact, create a situation where we see a function and its derivative as shown above. In this case, so we can confirm that we have correctly identified the functions and to un-do the product rule. This, we can re-write the left hand side of the equation as follows.   We've made a big step forward, here! Remember that our goal is to find the unknown function , so we are much closer since we appears in only one place in this equation. In order to un-do the differentiation, we can integrate both sides of the equation.   Finally, we can solve for by multiplying both sides of the equation by    We have made a point of simplifying whenever possible, and you should look to do that as you work. You may be tempted to replace the with a single constant; remember, however, that a constant times a function is not a constant, so we cannot simplify that last term any further.  Hence, we have found the solution to the DE. We can always verify our solution by substituting back in to the original DE. This is optional, but the details are included here.     "

In an ideal world, we would immediately be able to un-do the product rule on the left hand side of the equation. Unfortunately, this doesn't work right now, so we need to do a little work to force it to work. %Obviously this sentence is awful. We would still like to push this into the form shown in ( ), so we can first divide the entire equation by the coefficient on , and then multiply by the function that will help us un-do the product rule.   In Example 6, we showed that the function we need is given by . We need only identify the function as in ( ). For this DE, we have . Take special note of the inclusion of the negative sign. Hence, we have   Note that we have assumed that the constant of integration is zero because we know we need just one function , and we choose the simplest one.

We have just made a huge step forward in solving this DE! We have made it so that the unknown function now appears in the equation only once, so we can now work to solve for . As it stands, the function is inside a derivative, so we can integrate both sides (with respect to the independent variable).   The integration and differentiation will un-do each other on the left hand side. On the right hand side, we need a substitution, , in order to achieve the integration. This means , or equivalently    We are almost done; we need only divide both sides of the equation by to solve for .

Additional Examples    Determine if the integrating factor method can be applied to the differential equation     As always, we start by trying to classify the equation to determine which method applies. A quick observation shows us that we are dealing with a first order, nonlinear differential equation.  The term makes the DE nonlinear.  This leaves separation of variables as the remaining possibility, but it is also easy to see that the and terms cannot be separated by multiplication.  Since the classification falls outside the requirements of any of our known methods, we are not equipped to solve it at this time.     Given that is some unknown function of , compute .         Suppose some product rule produced the following derivative Write down the product rule that this came from. That is, rewrite it in the form    Our goal is to find and so that the product rule gives us . This requires that we match the terms of and .  Observing that , and then it makes sense to match the terms like so   Therefore, we can rewrite like so and we have \"reversed the product rule\".     Suppose the following expression is the derivative of a product of two functions, where is a function of : Find the two functions and write down the derivative of their product, explicitly showing the steps involving the product rule.   We are still trying to identify two functions, and , such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We may need to rearrange a little bit, but we do in fact have such functions, as shown below. Hence, and and the derivative, using the product rule, is   Warning: You've been looking at a very special class of expressions! Not every sum of terms comes from the product rule. For example, we cannot un-do the product rule in the expression because the derivative of is not . You should pay close attention to whether you can or cannot un-do the product rule; this can help confirm if you have or have not made a mistake in solving a DE. We'll discuss this further later.     Rewrite the expression as a \"reversed product rule\" in the form    We will approach this as before and attempt to match the appropriate terms.  The product rule tells us that is the same as   We used the chain rule to compute   After arranging the terms, we match with and see that can only be matched to . So, and this means that is the anti-derivative of , or This shows that there are many possible answers (one for each value of ), but only one is required. So we pick which makes and conclude that      Find a function, , such that tbe product rule applied to gives    As we did before, we need to identify functions such that we see each function and its derivative as in the product rule. We might label them as follows.   Based on the labeling in the question above, if we are going to be able to un-do the product rule, we need the function to be such that its derivative is . We can translate that into a mathematical statement:   In order to determine the unknown function , we need to solve a differential equation! It turns out that this DE is first order and separable, so we can solve it using separation of variables.   While we could choose any value for that we like, we are looking for just one function , so we will simplify things by choosing . Thus, the function we found is . Now let's confirm that it works. If we substitute our function in for in , then we can un-do the product rule as follows:   Notice that if we identify as the function , then we do indeed see its derivative, in the other term. If we made a mistake in finding the function , this would be the point where we could catch our mistake.     Suppose is a function of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    It may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.   If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function such that   This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.   Since we need only one function , we can choose any value we like for . Here we will choose , and therefore the function is . We can check by un-doing the product rule.      Suppose and are functions of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    This is a generic version of the previous example. If we can draw a conclusion using this generic version, we might be able to use it in future examples.  As before, it may be easier to sort this out if we label parts of the equation to align with the product rule, as below.   If we're going to be able to undo the product rule, we will need to find a function such that   This is a first order, separable DE, and we solve it accordingly.   Since we need only one function , we usually choose the positive one and therefore we write .  This may not look like much, but let's see if it would work for the previous examples already did. Recall that we were trying to un-do the product rule in the expression   In this example, we would identify the function as . Then the function we desire would be given by   (Notice that we chose because we need only one function , and this is the simplest choice for ).  So our formula does give the same function we found previously. Let's practice one more.     Suppose is a function of . Find one function such that the derivative of has the form    In this example, the plays the same role as (in the previous EXAMPLE). Thus we can find in a similar way.   As in the previous example, we need only one function , so we can simplify this expression. In this case, we can choose , and we can also eliminate the absolute value. This lead us to , which further simplifies to . As in the previous examples, we can replace in the original expression and then actually un-do the product rule.      Additional Practice   Additional Narrative  We know that can be written as So we must match these terms with the terms in . Writing out these terms side-by-side helps determine the matching, as shown here   Matching the terms of the top and middle expressions in order to reverse the product rule. Notice the terms are already equal, so we only need to find .      From the figure we see that since it is the term next to . Moreover, a quick check also shows that completing the matching.  In this chapter, we will study a solution technique that will help us solve differential equations that are first order and linear. Consider this (carefully selected) example. Notice that the dependent variable is and the independent variable is , so we seek to find a formula for in terms of . The DE is also first order and linear.  What makes this DE special is that the left hand side can be rewritten as follows. We can verify this by actually using the product rule to take the derivative on the left hand side:   Now that we have confirmed that Equation is equivalent to Equation , we can proceed in solving the DE.  The unknown function we want to solve for is , and it is part of the product we are taking the derivative of in Equation . So we begin by undoing that differentiation by integrating both sides of Equation with respect to :   We can now just divide both sides of Equation by the coefficient on to obtain the general solution.   Recall that we said this was a carefully selected DE. This very special DE had the property that we could undo the product rule on its left hand side. This is not, in general, the case when we encounter a first order linear DE. For example, consider this DE.  (use one of the first examples we do in the book??)  We cannot immediately undo the product rule here, but there is some hope. We do see the unknown function and its derivative, so we have some of the stuff we need to undo the product rule. What we'll see in this chapter is that we can manipulate the DE so that we will be able to undo the product rule and proceed to solve as we did in the example above, and so we begin this chapter by focusing on the details around making that possible.  The integration factor technique relies heavily on our understanding of the product rule for differentiation, so let's quickly recall what this looks like and go over some examples.       or        product rule   DO WE WANT A SUMMARY?  Let's summarize the procedure we have been working on.   Solving First Order Linear DEs with an Integrating Factor   Verify that the DE is first order and linear. (Don't overlook this step!! Nothing that follows here makes any sense if the DE isn't both first order and linear.)  Rearrange the DE to put it in standard form for this solution technique. In standard form, the dependent variable and the derivative are on the left hand side of the equation and the coefficient on the derivative is 1. (Here we assume that is the independent variable and is the dependent variable; this will look different if your DE has different independent and dependent variables).  Identify the function and then find the integrating factor (Note that we integrate with respect to the independent variable. We also need only one integrating factor, so we typically omit the that is ordinarily associated with an indefinite integral.)  Multiply both sides of the DE by the integrating factor.  Rewrite the left hand side of the DE by \"un-doing\" the product rule. This is the crucial step where you should check to make sure that you really can un-do the product rule. If you can't then check to make sure you correctly determined determined the integrating factor.  Integrate both sides of the equation (with respect to the independent variable). (Here you should have a constant of integration.)  Solve for the dependent variable to get the general solution.  If an initial condition is provided, apply it last to determine the value of the constant of integration.    The idea in the previous examples will be at the center of helping us solve the DEs of this chapter, but we need to expand on this a bit to fully prepare you for the discussion in the next section. Let's now dive into the following examples to see what we mean.   Taken From Integrating Factor   and then we integrate both sides with respect to to free the unknown from inside the , so that we can solve for it. However, we have not talked about how the integrating factor gets the differential equation into this form. Luckily, the product rule for deriviatives holds the answer. Therefore, let's start this discussing by reminding ourselves that the product rule is given by   Ok, the claim is that after a some math the differential equation can be rewritten as To explain this, it may be easier to work backwards. That is, let's start with and see how it may connect back to . We start by applying the product rule on the left side, At this point stop and compare equation with the last equation . Do you see how the two equations are connected?  You should see that multiplying both sides of by gives you .  In a nutshell, the integrating factor technique attempts to solve by multiplying both sides by an unknown function,  then find a so that the left-hand side can be written as the product rule of and .   To clarify, let's look at an example where we know .  The previous example shows how to solve the equation when you know what is. However, in a real problem, you will have to find first!  Let's build on the previous example to try and understand why worked. It is important to try and think of as the missing part needed to to be consistent with the product rule. That is, the left-side of the equation is missing a second function needed to be consistent with the product rule. So let's fill-in this missing function by multiplying both sides by , Is the left-side, , equal to ? Well, not exactly, since taking this derivative shows the difference between these two, namely                                  difference             left-side           However, what if was chosen so that ? It turns out that this is exactly how we chose . Finding such that is itself a differential equation which can be solved using separation of variables. (You may try it yourself first for practice, then look below to see how to solve this DE.)  Using separation of variables, solve to get the solution    Since, we only need one to work, we choose for convenience, hence Now you see where the came from in part 1 of . In fact, this example outlines how is found for any first order linear differential equation of the form    "

Find the solutions to the characteristic equation and use them to write down each term of the general solution. The key difference lies in the fact that you must solve a high-degree polynomial equation, which can be challenging since you no longer have a simple formula to give you the solutions.  To see this, consider the -th order LHCC equation, , which has an -th degree characteristic equation .     Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions            Let's solve a third-order LHCC equation:  .   First, write down the characteristic equation:  . Solving for , we get three distinct real roots:  . Therefore, the general solution is:  .     Consider another example, a fourth-order LHCC equation:  .   The characteristic equation is:  . Let , then we can rewrite the equation as:  . Solving for , we get:  . Thus, gives , and gives . The general solution is:  .   As seen in these examples, solving the characteristic equation for higher-order LHCC equations follows the same principles as for lower-order equations. However, as the degree of the polynomial increases, solving the characteristic equation analytically can become impractical due to the complexity of the roots.  For higher-degree characteristic equations, numerical methods and computer algebra systems are typically employed to find the roots. Software tools like MATLAB, Mathematica, and even graphing calculators can assist in solving these polynomial equations, allowing us to focus on interpreting and utilizing the solutions.    Consider the fifth-order LHCC equation:  .   The characteristic equation is:  . Solving this polynomial equation analytically is challenging, so we use a numerical solver. The roots are found to be approximately:  . The general solution, incorporating these roots, is:  .   By recognizing the type of roots and using technology to solve higher-degree polynomials, we can extend our approach to solve any higher-order LHCC equation effectively.

To see this, let's bring back the equation from the last section, , which we know has as a solution. Would it still be a solution if we tossed another term, say , onto it so that ?

However, there is one last detail that we still need to address. In particular, we need to know what to do when the selected form of has overlapping like-terms with the homogeneous solution, . In this section we will explain why this is a problem and how to fix it.  To illustrate this concept, note that the differential equation . has a particular solution of the form . Plugging it in gives which leads to an obvious problem. Recall that the parts of an LNCC general solution tells you that if simplifies to , then it must be part of the homogeneous solution!  Now, let's attempt to find a particular solution, . Since the right-hand side of the original equation is , we might initially guess: However, this term is already part of the homogeneous solution, . If we use this guess, we will not obtain a valid particular solution because it will be absorbed into the homogeneous part. To circumvent this, we adjust our guess by multiplying by to ensure linear independence:      Let's verify if this adjusted guess works by plugging it into the original equation. We find the necessary derivatives:   Substituting these into the differential equation: Simplifying, we get:   This simplifies to: Thus, we find:   Therefore, the particular solution is:   This example demonstrates the importance of adjusting the form of when it overlaps with . In general, if our initial guess for contains any term that is also part of , we multiply that term by to ensure independence. If the overlap persists, we multiply by higher powers of (e.g., , ) until the terms are linearly independent.  This adjustment process ensures that our particular solution remains valid and that we can correctly solve the differential equation. By recognizing when to adjust , we refine our approach to handling linear nonhomogeneous constant coefficient equations effectively.  Check your Understanding   Needs to be written   OK     "

The general solution to a non-homogeneous equation is the sum of the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation and a particular solution.  The method involves guessing the form of the particular solution based on the form of the non-homogeneous term and solving for the coefficients.  The method is applicable when the non-homogeneous term can be expressed as a linear combination of known functions.    The method of undetermined coefficients involves the following steps:   Verify that the method is applicable to the given differential equation.  Find the general solution to the corresponding homogeneous equation.  Guess the form of the particular solution based on the form of the non-homogeneous term.

Summary of the Key Ideas    Method           1   Exercise 1 Statement    2   Exercise 2 Statement   Describe the difference between a homogeneous and a non-homogeneous differential equation. A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives. For example, the equation is non-homogeneous because of the term on the right side, which is not a derivative or multiple of .

A differential equation is termed \"homogeneous\" if all the terms of the equation are either derivatives of the unknown function or multiples of the unknown function itself, and the equation can be set equal to zero. In other words, there are no terms in the equation that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants. For example, the equation is homogeneous because all its terms involve or its derivatives and the equation is set equal to zero. A differential equation is termed \"non-homogeneous\" if it contains terms that are solely functions of the independent variable or constants which are not multiples of the unknown function or its derivatives.

  "body": "Orphaned Content   This is just a place to put content that was written and may or not be used.   We can write this solution as . Substituting this into the equation and separating the and parts gives   Notice that each part looks like we separately plugged and into the left side of . Now, suppose the part simplified to and the part gave you , then the sum of these parts still equal . This of as the parts of the solution that cancel out with each other and as the parts that simplify to (like in the previous section).  We can get these two parts by separately solving the equations, , for and . Adding these together gives the general solution, . The next example summarizes this process.  Additional Examples    Determine a particular solution to     The point here is to find a particular solution, however the first thing that we're going to do is find the homogeneous solution to this differential equation. Recall that the homogeneous solution comes from solving,   The characteristic equation for this differential equation and its roots are.   The homogeneous solution is then,   At this point the reason for doing this first will not be apparent, however we want you in the habit of finding it before we start the work to find a particular solution. Eventually, as we'll see, having the homogeneous solution in hand will be helpful and so it's best to be in the habit of finding it first prior to doing the work for undetermined coefficients.  Now, let's proceed with finding a particular solution. As mentioned prior to the start of this example we need to make a guess as to the form of a particular solution to this differential equation. Since is an exponential and we know that exponentials never just appear or disappear in the differentiation process it seems that a likely form of the particular solution would be   Now, all that we need to do is do a couple of derivatives, plug this into the differential equation and see if we can determine what needs to be.  Plugging into the differential equation gives   So, in order for our guess to be a solution we will need to choose so that, Okay, we found a value for the coefficient. This means that we guessed correctly. A particular solution to the differential equation is then,       Solve the following initial value problem.     We know that the general solution will be of the form,   and we already have both the homogeneous and particular solution from the first example so we don't really need to do any extra work for this problem.  One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to find the homogeneous solution and then, because we're probably in the habit of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the homogeneous solution to find the constants. This however, is incorrect. The homogeneous solution is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the homogeneous solution.  So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation. Taking the homogeneous solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example we get the following for a general solution and its derivative.   Now, apply the initial conditions to these.   Solving this system gives . The actual solution is then.      Find a particular solution for the equation    Again, let's note that we should probably find the homogeneous solution before we proceed onto the guess for a particular solution. However, because the homogeneous differential equation for this example is the same as that for the first example we won't bother with that here.  Now, let's take our experience from the first example and apply that here. The first example had an exponential function in the and our guess was an exponential. This differential equation has a sine so let's try the following guess for the particular solution.   Differentiating and plugging into the differential equation gives,   Collecting like terms yields   We need to pick so that we get the same function on both sides of the equal sign. This means that the coefficients of the sines and cosines must be equal. Or,   Notice two things. First, since there is no cosine on the right hand side this means that the coefficient must be zero on that side. More importantly we have a serious problem here. In order for the cosine to drop out, as it must in order for the guess to satisfy the differential equation, we need to set to keep the sine around will also keep the cosine around.  What this means is that our initial guess was wrong. If we get multiple values of the same constant or are unable to find the value of a constant then we have guessed wrong.  One of the nicer aspects of this method is that when we guess wrong our work will often suggest a fix. In this case the problem was the cosine that cropped up. So, to counter this let's add a cosine to our guess. Our new guess is   Plugging this into the differential equation and collecting like terms gives,   Now, set the coefficients equal   Solving this system gives us   We found constants and this time we guessed correctly. A particular solution to the differential equation is then,      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    Once, again we will generally want the homogeneous solution in hand first, but again we're working with the same homogeneous differential equation (you'll eventually see why we keep working with the same homogeneous problem) so we'll again just refer to the first example.  For this example, is a cubic polynomial. For this we will need the following guess for the particular solution.   Notice that even though in it our guess will still need one! So, differentiate and plug into the differential equation.   Now, as we've done in the previous examples we will need the coefficients of the terms on both sides of the equal sign to be the same so set coefficients equal and solve. Notice that in this case it was very easy to solve for the constants. The first equation gave , etc . A particular solution for this differential equation is then      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    You're probably getting tired of the opening comment, but again finding the homogeneous solution first really a good idea but again we've already done the work in the first example so we won't do it again here. We promise that eventually you'll see why we keep using the same homogeneous problem and why we say it's a good idea to have the homogeneous solution in hand first. At this point all we're trying to do is reinforce the habit of finding the homogeneous solution first.  Okay, let's start off by writing down the guesses for the individual pieces of the function. The guess for the would be   while the guess for the exponential would be   Now, since we've got a product of two functions it seems like taking a product of the guesses for the individual pieces might work. Doing this would give   However, we will have problems with this. As we will see, when we plug our guess into the differential equation we will only get two equations out of this. The problem is that with this guess we've got three unknown constants. With only two equations we won't be able to solve for all the constants.  This is easy to fix however. Let's notice that we could do the following   If we multiply the through, we can see that the guess can be written in such a way that there are really only two constants. So, we will use the following for our guess.   Notice that this is nothing more than the guess for the with an exponential tacked on for good measure.  Now that we've got our guess, let's differentiate, plug into the differential equation and collect like terms.   Note that when we're collecting like terms we want the coefficient of each term to have only constants in it. Following this rule we will get two terms when we collect like terms. Now, set coefficients equal.   A particular solution for this differential equation is then      Write down the form of the particular solution to        a g\\left( t \\right) = 16{{\\bf{e}}^{7t}}\\sin \\left( {10t} \\right)  So, we have an exponential in the function. Remember the rule. We will ignore the exponential and write down a guess for then put the exponential back in.  The guess for the sine is   Now, for the actual guess for the particular solution we'll take the above guess and tack an exponential onto it. This gives,   One final note before we move onto the next part. The 16 in front of the function has absolutely no bearing on our guess. Any constants multiplying the whole function are ignored.    b g\\left( t \\right) = \\left( {9{t^2} - 103t} \\right)\\cos t  We will start this one the same way that we initially started the previous example. The guess for the polynomial is   and the guess for the cosine is   If we multiply the two guesses we get.   Let's simplify things up a little. First multiply the polynomial through as follows.   Notice that everywhere one of the unknown constants occurs it is in a product of unknown constants. This means that if we went through and used this as our guess the system of equations that we would need to solve for the unknown constants would have products of the unknowns in them. These types of systems are generally very difficult to solve.  So, to avoid this we will do the same thing that we did in the previous example. Everywhere we see a product of constants we will rename it and call it a single constant. The guess that we'll use for this function will be.   This is a general rule that we will use when faced with a product of a polynomial and a trig function. We write down the guess for the polynomial and then multiply that by a cosine. We then write down the guess for the polynomial again, using different coefficients, and multiply this by a sine.    c g\\left( t \\right) = - {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}}\\left( {3 - 5t} \\right)\\cos \\left( {9t} \\right)  This final part has all three parts to it. First, we will ignore the exponential and write down a guess for.   The minus sign can also be ignored. The guess for this is   Now, tack an exponential back on and we're done.   Notice that we put the exponential on both terms.      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    This example is the reason that we've been using the same homogeneous differential equation for all the previous examples. There is nothing to do with this problem. All that we need to do it go back to the appropriate examples above and get the particular solution from that example and add them all together.  Doing this gives      Write down the form of the particular solution to  for the following 's.            a g\\left( t \\right) = 4\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - 9\\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This first one we've actually already told you how to do. This is in the table of the basic functions. However, we wanted to justify the guess that we put down there. Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give.   So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from each guess. The problem with this as a guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns. We will never be able to solve for each of the constants.  To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as follows.   Upon doing this we can see that we've really got a single cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may as well just use   The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms with single coefficients. This will greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients.    b g\\left( t \\right) = - 2\\sin t + \\sin \\left( {14t} \\right) - 5\\cos \\left( {14t} \\right)  For this one we will get two sets of sines and cosines. This will arise because we have two different arguments in them. We will get one set for the sine with just a as their arguments.  The guess for this function is     c g\\left( t \\right) = {{\\bf{e}}^{7t}} + 6  The main point of this problem is dealing with the constant. But that isn't too bad. We just wanted to make sure that an example of that is somewhere in the notes. If you recall that a constant is nothing more than a zeroth degree polynomial the guess becomes clear.  The guess for this function is     d g\\left( t \\right) = 6{t^2} - 7\\sin \\left( {3t} \\right) + 9  This one can be a little tricky if you aren't paying attention. Let's first rewrite the function   All we did was move the 9. However, upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a quadratic polynomial and a sine. The guess for this is then   If we don't do this and treat the function as the sum of three terms we would get   and as with the first part in this example we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same (the ) and so would need to be combined. An added step that isn't really necessary if we first rewrite the function.  Look for problems where rearranging the function can simplify the initial guess.    e g\\left( t \\right) = 10{{\\bf{e}}^t} - 5t{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}} + 2{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}  So, this look like we've got a sum of three terms here. Let's write down a guess for that.   Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same and would need to be combined. This is a case where the guess for one term is completely contained in the guess for a different term. When this happens we just drop the guess that's already included in the other term.  So, the guess here is actually.   Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our whose only difference was the polynomial that sat in front of them. When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree polynomial, write down the guess for that and don't bother writing down the guess for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first guess.    f g\\left( t \\right) = {t^2}\\cos t - 5t\\sin t  In this case we've got two terms whose guess without the polynomials in front of them would be the same. Therefore, we will take the one with the largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that one and ignore the other term. So, the guess for the function is     g g\\left( t \\right) = 5{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}} + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}}\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - \\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This last part is designed to make sure you understand the general rule that we used in the last two parts. This time there really are three terms and we will need a guess for each term. The guess here is   We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to the constant. So, we can't combine the first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different functions. Likewise, the last sine and cosine can't be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are different.      Find a particular solution for the following differential equation.    This problem seems almost too simple to be given this late in the section. This is especially true given the ease of finding a particular solution for )'s that are just exponential functions. Also, because the point of this example is to illustrate why it is generally a good idea to have the homogeneous solution in hand first we'll let's go ahead and recall the homogeneous solution first. Here it is,   Now, without worrying about the homogeneous solution for a couple more seconds let's go ahead and get to work on the particular solution. There is not much to the guess here. From our previous work we know that the guess for the particular solution should be,   Plugging this into the differential equation gives,   Hmmmm…. Something seems wrong here. Clearly an exponential can't be zero. So, what went wrong? We finally need the homogeneous solution. Notice that the second term in the homogeneous solution (listed above) is exactly our guess for the form of the particular solution and now recall that both portions of the homogeneous solution are solutions to the homogeneous differential equation,   In other words, we had better have gotten zero by plugging our guess into the differential equation, it is a solution to the homogeneous differential equation!  So, how do we fix this? The way that we fix this is to add a to our guess as follows.   Plugging this into our differential equation gives,   Now, we can set coefficients equal.   So, the particular solution in this case is,      Write down the guess for the particular solution to the given differential equation. Do not find the coefficients.          In these solutions we'll leave the details of checking the homogeneous solution to you.   a y'' + 3y' - 28y = 7t + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 7t}} - 1  The homogeneous solution is   Remembering to put the -1 with the 7 gives a first guess for the particular solution.   Notice that the last term in the guess is the last term in the homogeneous solution. The first two terms however aren't a problem and don't appear in the homogeneous solution. Therefore, we will only add a onto the last term.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution is.     b y'' - 100y = 9{t^2}{{\\bf{e}}^{10t}} + \\cos t - t\\sin t  The homogeneous solution is   A first guess for the particular solution is   Notice that if we multiplied the exponential term through the parenthesis that we would end up getting part of the homogeneous solution showing up. Since the problem part arises from the first term the whole first term will get multiplied by . The second and third terms are okay as they are.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution in this case is.   So, in general, if you were to multiply out a guess and if any term in the result shows up in the homogeneous solution, then the whole term will get a not just the problem portion of the term.    c    The homogeneous solution is   A first guess for the particular solution is   In this case both the second and third terms contain portions of the homogeneous solution. The first term doesn't however, since upon multiplying out, both the sine and the cosine would have an exponential with them and that isn't part of the homogeneous solution. We only need to worry about terms showing up in the homogeneous solution if the only difference between the homogeneous solution term and the particular guess term is the constant in front of them.  So, in this case the second and third terms will get a while the first won't  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution is.     d 4y'' + 16y' + 17y = {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 2t}}\\sin \\left( {\\frac{t}{2}} \\right) + 6t\\cos \\left( {\\frac{t}{2}} \\right)  To get this problem we changed the differential equation from the last example and left the alone. The homogeneous solution this time is   As with the last part, a first guess for the particular solution is   This time however it is the first term that causes problems and not the second or third. In fact, the first term is exactly the homogeneous solution and so it will need a . Recall that we will only have a problem with a term in our guess if it only differs from the homogeneous solution by a constant. The second and third terms in our guess don't have the exponential in them and so they don't differ from the homogeneous solution by only a constant.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution is.     e y'' + 8y' + 16y = {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 4t}} + \\left( {{t^2} + 5} \\right){{\\bf{e}}^{ - 4t}}  The homogeneous solution is   The two terms in are identical with the exception of a polynomial in front of them. So this means that we only need to look at the term with the highest degree polynomial in front of it. A first guess for the particular solution is   Notice that if we multiplied the exponential term through the parenthesis the last two terms would be the homogeneous solution. Therefore, we will need to multiply this whole thing by a .  The next guess for the particular solution is then.   This still causes problems however. If we multiplied the to our guess.  The correct guess for the form of the particular solution is.   Upon multiplying this out none of the terms are in the homogeneous solution and so it will be okay.        Additional Practice   "

We know that the general solution will be of the form,   and we already have both the homogeneous and particular solution from the first example so we don't really need to do any extra work for this problem.  One of the more common mistakes in these problems is to find the homogeneous solution and then, because we're probably in the habit of doing it, apply the initial conditions to the homogeneous solution to find the constants. This however, is incorrect. The homogeneous solution is only the solution to the homogeneous differential equation and we are after a solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation and the initial conditions must satisfy that solution instead of the homogeneous solution.  So, we need the general solution to the nonhomogeneous differential equation. Taking the homogeneous solution and the particular solution that we found in the previous example we get the following for a general solution and its derivative.   Now, apply the initial conditions to these.   Solving this system gives . The actual solution is then.    "

In order for the cosine to drop out, as it must in order for the guess to satisfy the differential equation, we need to set to keep the sine around will also keep the cosine around.  What this means is that our initial guess was wrong. If we get multiple values of the same constant or are unable to find the value of a constant then we have guessed wrong.  One of the nicer aspects of this method is that when we guess wrong our work will often suggest a fix. In this case the problem was the cosine that cropped up. So, to counter this let's add a cosine to our guess.

You're probably getting tired of the opening comment, but again finding the homogeneous solution first really a good idea but again we've already done the work in the first example so we won't do it again here.

Doing this would give   However, we will have problems with this. As we will see, when we plug our guess into the differential equation we will only get two equations out of this.

Let's notice that we could do the following   If we multiply the through, we can see that the guess can be written in such a way that there are really only two constants.

Notice that everywhere one of the unknown constants occurs it is in a product of unknown constants.

This is in the table of the basic functions. However, we wanted to justify the guess that we put down there. Using the fact on sums of function we would be tempted to write down a guess for the cosine and a guess for the sine. This would give.   So, we would get a cosine from each guess and a sine from each guess. The problem with this as a guess is that we are only going to get two equations to solve after plugging into the differential equation and yet we have 4 unknowns. We will never be able to solve for each of the constants.  To fix this notice that we can combine some terms as follows.   Upon doing this we can see that we've really got a single cosine with a coefficient and a single sine with a coefficient and so we may as well just use   The general rule of thumb for writing down guesses for functions that involve sums is to always combine like terms into single terms with single coefficients. This will greatly simplify the work required to find the coefficients.    b g\\left( t \\right) = - 2\\sin t + \\sin \\left( {14t} \\right) - 5\\cos \\left( {14t} \\right)  For this one we will get two sets of sines and cosines. This will arise because we have two different arguments in them. We will get one set for the sine with just a as their arguments.  The guess for this function is     c g\\left( t \\right) = {{\\bf{e}}^{7t}} + 6  The main point of this problem is dealing with the constant. But that isn't too bad. We just wanted to make sure that an example of that is somewhere in the notes. If you recall that a constant is nothing more than a zeroth degree polynomial the guess becomes clear.  The guess for this function is     d g\\left( t \\right) = 6{t^2} - 7\\sin \\left( {3t} \\right) + 9  This one can be a little tricky if you aren't paying attention. Let's first rewrite the function   All we did was move the 9. However, upon doing that we see that the function is really a sum of a quadratic polynomial and a sine. The guess for this is then   If we don't do this and treat the function as the sum of three terms we would get   and as with the first part in this example we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same (the ) and so would need to be combined. An added step that isn't really necessary if we first rewrite the function.  Look for problems where rearranging the function can simplify the initial guess.    e g\\left( t \\right) = 10{{\\bf{e}}^t} - 5t{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}} + 2{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 8t}}  So, this look like we've got a sum of three terms here. Let's write down a guess for that.   Notice however that if we were to multiply the exponential in the second term through we would end up with two terms that are essentially the same and would need to be combined. This is a case where the guess for one term is completely contained in the guess for a different term. When this happens we just drop the guess that's already included in the other term.  So, the guess here is actually.   Notice that this arose because we had two terms in our whose only difference was the polynomial that sat in front of them. When this happens we look at the term that contains the largest degree polynomial, write down the guess for that and don't bother writing down the guess for the other term as that guess will be completely contained in the first guess.    f g\\left( t \\right) = {t^2}\\cos t - 5t\\sin t  In this case we've got two terms whose guess without the polynomials in front of them would be the same. Therefore, we will take the one with the largest degree polynomial in front of it and write down the guess for that one and ignore the other term. So, the guess for the function is     g g\\left( t \\right) = 5{{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}} + {{\\bf{e}}^{ - 3t}}\\cos \\left( {6t} \\right) - \\sin \\left( {6t} \\right)  This last part is designed to make sure you understand the general rule that we used in the last two parts. This time there really are three terms and we will need a guess for each term. The guess here is   We can only combine guesses if they are identical up to the constant. So, we can't combine the first exponential with the second because the second is really multiplied by a cosine and a sine and so the two exponentials are in fact different functions. Likewise, the last sine and cosine can't be combined with those in the middle term because the sine and cosine in the middle term are in fact multiplied by an exponential and so are different.    "

We formalize this with the following definition.  Laplace Transform  The Laplace Transform of a given function is defined as provided that the integral exists (i.e., the improper integral converges).   This definition might seem intimidating at first, but let's break it down. The in the upper limit indicates that the Laplace transform is an improper integral. In calculus, we learn that such an integral can be rewritten as a limit. Specifically, Also, note that the integral involves two variables, and , but we integrate with respect to . If you haven't encountered this before, simply treat as a constant during the integration. Let's dive into an example to clarify this further.   Compute .

In general, every Laplace transform results in a function of , and it's customary to denote the Laplace transform of a function as . For example,     We also identified the values of for which the integral converges. While these values are important, they generally do not affect the solution of the differential equations in practice. Nonetheless, we will continue to note them as we build our Laplace transform toolbox.    The notation for the Laplace transform involves the symbol The curly braces that accompany it are not optional; they indicate precisely which function we are transforming.

  "body": "Properties of Laplace Transforms  Now that we've explored individual Laplace transforms, its time to delve into some of the key properties that make the Laplace transform such a powerful tool for solving differential equations. These properties allow us to manipulate and combine transforms in ways that simplify complex problems.  Linearity  The first property we'll explore is linearity. This property is foundational because it allows us to break down and combine transforms easily. The linearity of the Laplace transform is similar to the linearity of integrals, where we can distribute the transform across addition and subtraction, and pull out constants.    Use the definition of the Laplace transform to compute:   Let's start by applying the definition of the Laplace transform: Here, we've expanded the expression inside the integral. Notice that each term is something we've already encountered in previous sections. We can now use the linearity property to separate the integral: We already know the Laplace transforms of these individual functions: To satisfy all the conditions on , we must have since that ensures all terms are defined. Therefore:     This example demonstrates the linearity property in action. The general statement of the linearity property is as follows: if and are constants, then: or, equivalently:   Laplace Transform Property          Check your Understanding   True-False. The linearity property allows you to find the Laplace transform of a sum of functions by adding the Laplace transforms of the individual functions.   True.

No, the constant should multiply the Laplace transform, not divide it.       Correct! The linearity property allows you to factor the constant out of the transform.       No, the constant should not be added to the Laplace transform but should multiply it.       No, the correct expression is simply .      Which of the following is NOT a correct application of the linearity property?      No, this is a correct application of the linearity property.       Correct!

No, the correct expression involves adding the two terms, not subtracting them.       No, the constant b must multiply the second term as well.       No, the constant a must multiply the first term.      Multiplication by  The translation property, also known as the first shifting theorem, allows us to handle functions multiplied by an exponential term, . This property is particularly useful for simplifying the Laplace transforms of products of exponential functions and other functions, such as sine, cosine, or polynomials.    Compute .  By the definition of the Laplace transform, we have: Thus, the Laplace transform of is:     The translation property can be generalized for any function multiplied by . The property is formally stated as: where is the Laplace transform of .  Laplace Transform Property  Let .     is a constant.

  "body": "Transforming Equations  Throughout this section, we learned how to apply Laplace transforms to individual functions. However, our goal is to solve differential equations, which means we need to understand how to transform an entire differential equation, including its initial conditions. This brings us back to the first step in the Laplace Transform Method roadmap.    Step 1: The Forward Laplace Transform    Our goal here is to apply the Laplace transform to both sides of this equation using the common transforms and properties we've discussed. Recall that applying a Laplace transform to a function can be thought of as multiplying the function by and integrating with respect to . However, instead of explicitly writing out this process for every term, we simply apply the Laplace operator, , to both sides of the equation. Let's break this down with an example.   Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem   First, apply to both sides of the equation , and use the linearity property,   , to split this into four separate transforms. For this example, we will look at each one individually.   Plugging back into the equation, we get     To further illustrate this process, consider one more example.   Apply the Laplace Transform to the initial-value problem .  Applying the Laplace transform to both sides gives:     In both examples, the differential equations have been transformed into algebraic equations, where solving for will be the next step in the Laplace Transform Roadmap.  Check-Point Questions   True-False: Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation transforms the equation into an algebraic equation in the s-domain.   True.

  "body": "Summary & Exercises   In this section, we introduced the concept of the forward Laplace transform and derived some common Laplace transforms that we will use throughtout this chapter. The following points summarize the essential concepts from the forward Laplace transform section:   Summary of the Key Ideas     Differential Algebraic Equations . The Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation, simplifying the solution process by eliminating derivatives.   Laplace Transform Concept . Applying the Laplace transform to a differential equation involves transforming each term by multiplying by and integrating with respect to from to , but is often simplified by directly applying the Laplace operator, .   Linearity Property . The Laplace transform is linear, meaning it distributes across addition and subtraction, and allows for constants to be factored out. This property is essential for transforming complex equations.   Transforming Initial Conditions . Initial conditions are incorporated directly into the Laplace-transformed equation, modifying the transformed terms to include initial values, making it easier to solve the resulting algebraic equation.   Common Function Transforms . The Laplace transforms of common functions, such as exponentials, sines, cosines, and polynomials, are essential tools in transforming differential equations and are summarized in the provided table.   Transforming Derivatives . The Laplace transform of a derivative, or higher, transfers the derivative onto the Laplace variable , reducing the order of the equation while introducing initial condition terms.   Multiplication by and . When multiplying a function by an exponential , the Laplace transform shifts by in the -domain, and multiplying by corresponds to differentiating the transform times with respect to , introducing a sign change.   Transforming the Entire Equation . The process of applying the Laplace transform to an entire differential equation with initial conditions involves systematically transforming each term and leads to a simplified algebraic equation in the -domain, ready for solving.

  "title": "Matching Forms",
  "body": "Matching Forms  When we study Laplace Transforms, we will frequently want to manipulate an algebraic expression to make it match a given form.  Suppose we have the expression and we think it looks much like the form It's not a perfect match, though. Based on the denominator, we might guess   Notice that this would make the denominator a perfect match, However, the numerator still isn't quite right. It would be correct if we would multiply the numerator by 5. But if we multiply the numerator by 5, we would change the expression. In order to NOT change the expression, we will instead multiply by as follows: Notice that when we multiply by , we are just multiplying by one, so we don't change the value of the expression.  In the previous section, we explored how to directly compute backward Laplace transforms when the function of matches a form in the common forward transform table . However, in practice, not all -functions will align perfectly with these forms. In fact, the most challenging part of the Laplace Transform Method lies in preparing the -function for the backward step. This process involves modifications of the function before matching the known forms in our table. In this discussion, we will cover some of the minor modifications that will need for the Laplace Transform Method.  Many of the forms in can be matched just by observing the denominator of the -function. The following table outlines the connection between the denominator and it associated transform.

This is done by multiplying the numerator and denominator by this constant as shown in the following examples.   Compute the inverse Laplace transforms for each.          The in the denominator tells us that we need . Before we do, let's factor out : .            Since the denominator has the form, , and there is no in the numerator, we should apply . As before, it is helpful to first factor out the constant , . According to , we are missing in the numerator.

In these cases, you can usually split the fraction as the sum of these forms.   Compute the inverse Laplace transforms for each.          The key to this problem is to split the fraction into two separate terms: Notice the first term matches with and the second term matches with , so             We can split the fraction into the terms, and apply the inverse Laplace transform to each Therefore, the inverse transform is          This section explored two relatively minor modifications needed to match and find the backward Laplace transform.

  "title": "Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms by Completing the Square",
  "body": "Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms by Completing the Square  As you progress through the Laplace Transform Method, you will often encounter rational functions that do not immediately match any known form in the table of Laplace transforms. For example, the -function does not align with the forms in the common forward transform table . One common way to address this is by rewriting the denominator in the form to match known transforms like or . This technique, called completing the square, is essential in transforming quadratic expressions to forms that are easier to work with in inverse Laplace computations.  This approach is appropriate when the roots of the quadratic expression in the denominator are complex. Recall from solving quadratic equations , if the discriminant is negative, then the quadratic function has complex roots. Therefore, a quick compuation of this value provides a good signal that completing the square is the correct approach as the following examples demonstrate.   Compute the inverse Laplace transforms of the following functions:   The discriminant of the denominator is , which is negative. Therefore, completing the square is necessary: . Rewriting gives: which matches ( ). Therefore,     The discriminant of the denominator is , which is negative. Completing the square gives: . Rewriting as: . Therefore, .    Completing the square for the denominator of gives: , and leaves us in a tricky situation where the numerator is not . This situation is addressed by rewriting as and grouping the with the . We then split the fraction. Here are all the details: , Therefore,     Completing the square is a crucial technique when working with quadratic expressions in the denominator of Laplace transforms. It allows the backward transformations to be found by rewriting the -function in a form that aligns with known inverse Laplace transforms. In the next subsection, we will explore another technique: partial fraction decomposition, which helps break down even more complex rational functions into simpler parts that can be easily matched to common inverse transforms.  Check your Understanding    True or False: Completing the square is used when the discriminant of the quadratic expression in the denominator is positive.   False. Completing the square is used when the discriminant is negative, indicating complex roots.     True or False: The expression matches the form required to apply the inverse Laplace transform found in the common transform table.   True. This expression matches the form in the table and can be directly transformed.     True or False: After completing the square on the denominator of , the numerator needs to be split to match the forms in the Laplace transform table.   True. The numerator needs to be adjusted to match the form for inverse Laplace transforms.    Which of the following steps is necessary to apply the inverse Laplace transform to ?    Factor the denominator   Incorrect. Factoring the denominator is not applicable in this case.     Complete the square in the denominator   Correct! Completing the square is necessary to match the form in the Laplace transform table.     Add constants to the numerator   Incorrect. The numerator is already in the correct form.

  "title": "Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms Using Partial Fraction Decomposition",
  "body": "Finding Inverse Laplace Transforms Using Partial Fraction Decomposition  When working with the Laplace Transform Method, you will sometimes encounter rational functions where the denominator is a polynomial that can be factored into simpler linear or quadratic factors. In such cases, partial fraction decomposition is a powerful technique that allows us to express the complex rational function as a sum of simpler fractions. These simpler fractions often correspond directly to known forms in the table of Laplace transforms, making it easier to apply the inverse transform.  The key idea behind partial fraction decomposition is to break down the original rational function into a sum of fractions, each with a simpler denominator. For example, if the denominator can be factored as , we can express the rational function as a sum of fractions with these linear factors as denominators. The goal is to match each of these fractions with a form in the Laplace transform table, allowing us to compute the inverse transform.  Let's explore this technique through a series of examples, starting with a quadratic denominator and gradually increasing the complexity.   Find the inverse Laplace transforms of each function.   First, we decompose into partial fractions:   To find and , we multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for the coefficients:   Expanding and collecting like terms, we get: Comparing coefficients, we find: Solving this system of equations, we obtain:   Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of is:   Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:     First, factor the quadratic denominator:   Next, decompose into partial fractions:   To find and , multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for the coefficients:   Expanding and collecting like terms, we get: Comparing coefficients, we find: Solving this system of equations, we obtain:   Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of is:   Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:     First, factor the quadratic denominator:   Next, decompose into partial fractions:   To find and , multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for the coefficients:   Expanding and collecting like terms, we get: Comparing coefficients, we find: Solving this system, we find and   Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of is:   Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:     Partial fraction decompostion also works for functions with higher-degree polynomials in the denominator. The key is to factor each denominator into as many linear and\/or quadratic factors as possible. Here are a few examples to illustrate this concept.   Find the inverse Laplace transforms of each function.   First, factor the cubic denominator:   Next, decompose into partial fractions:   To find , , and , multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for the coefficients:   Expanding and collecting like terms, we get: Comparing coefficients, we find: Solving this system, we find , , and   Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of is:   Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:     First, factor the quartic denominator:   Next, decompose into partial fractions:   To find , , , and , multiply both sides by the denominator and solve for the coefficients:   Expanding and collecting like terms, we find , , , and by comparing coefficients. Solving the system of equations, we find:   Therefore, the partial fraction decomposition of is:   Finally, using the table of Laplace transforms, we find the inverse Laplace transform of each term:     Partial fraction decomposition is a powerful technique when working with rational functions in Laplace transforms. By breaking down complex expressions into simpler fractions, you can match them to known inverse Laplace transforms, making the backward transformation process much easier. In the next subsection, we will explore more advanced techniques for handling cases with repeated roots and higher-order polynomials.

  "body": "Summary & Exercises   This section covers the final step in solving differential equations using the Laplace Transform Method: finding the inverse Laplace transform. The focus is on converting the algebraic equation with unknown function back to the original function . Several methods and techniques are introduced to handle different cases where direct computation isn't possible.   Summary of the Key Ideas    Common Forms: A table of common Laplace transforms is provided, which doubles as a reference for inverse transforms. The focus is on recognizing forms that match the table entries for functions like , and others.   Direct Computation: When the function of directly matches a form in the common Laplace transform table, the inverse Laplace transform can be easily computed.   Modifying Functions: When a function doesn't match a known form, minor modifications, such as multiplying by missing constants or splitting fractions, can help.   Completing the Square: When dealing with quadratic expressions in the denominator, especially when the discriminant is negative, completing the square can transform the expression into a form that matches known inverse Laplace transforms. Several examples demonstrate this technique.   Partial Fraction Decomposition: For more complex rational functions, partial fraction decomposition breaks down the function into simpler fractions that match the common transform forms.       Match the Sine Form   Rewrite each of the following into the form , by filling in the appropriate values in the boxes.

  "body": "Overview  At this point, the roadmap introduced at the beginning of this chapter should start to come together. You've learned how the forward Laplace transform converts a differential equation into an algebraic equation and how the backward Laplace transform converts the original transform to recover the solution. Now, it's time to see how all these pieces fit into the bigger picture of solving differential equations using the Laplace Transform Method.  This method is powerful because it leverages integration properties and the exponential function to transform a differential equation into an algebra problem. In essence, the process begins by applying the forward Laplace transform to the entire differential equation (Step 1), which temporarily encases the unknown inside . Next, you use algebra to isolate (Step 2). After that, you prepare for the backward transform by breaking into a sum of functions that correspond to known Laplace transforms (Step 3). Finally, you apply the backward transform to to recover the solution, (Step 4).  All of these steps have been explored in previous sections, and now, you are ready to apply them in sequence to solve a complete initial-value problem. The general strategy for this method is outlined as follows:  Laplace Transform Method  The particular solution to the initial-valued differential equation and given initial conditions, follows from these steps:  Step 1: Apply the Forward Transform  Apply the Laplace transform, , to both sides of . Use the table and properties to convert each term into a function of .   Step 2: Solve for  Use algebra to isolate as a function of .   Step 3: Prepare for the Backward Transform  Use techniques such as completing the square or partial fraction decompoition to rewrite as a sum of -functions found in the table of common transforms .   Step 4: Apply the Backward Transform  Apply the inverse Laplace transform, , to both sides of the equation to get the solution .      By following these steps, the Laplace Transform Method provides a clear path from the original differential equation to its solution, leveraging the power of both forward and backward transforms.

  "body": " Unit Step Functions  The two solution techniques we have been studying most recently (the Method of Undetermined Coefficients and solution via Laplace transforms) can be used to solve DEs that are linear and have constant coefficients. Recall, however, that we would not be able to use the Method of Undetermined Coefficients to solve DEs where the nonhomogeneous function is discontinuous. We will be able to use Laplace transforms to solve such DEs, but we first need to understand the unit step function , which will be used to rewrite discontinuous functions in a particular way.  make a definition box for the unit step function. add a graph  We begin by introducing the definition of the standard unit step function. The unit step function , , is defined to be    For the unit step function defined above, complete the following:  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate , where is a positive constant  evaluate , where is a negative constant  Sketch        Since the input to the unit step function, , is positive,  Similarly, since the input to the function is positive,  The input to the function is negative, so  If is any positive constant, then  If is any negative constant, then  Sketch:   How about this?         Re-word this and\/or move it near the definition. Compare to e^x as well as sine.  It's important to remember that from this point forward, that the unit step function is well-defined. There is only one unit step function, , in the same way that there is only one sine function, We will now build on the definition to learn more about how this function behaves.   Consider the function and complete the following:  evaluate .  evaluate .  evaluate .  evaluate where .  evaluate where .  Sketch  Write as a piecewise defined function.        Notice that . Since the input to the unit step function is negative, we have   Similar to the previous question, . In this case, the input to the unit step function is positive, so we have   As in the previous two questions, we evaluate as follows.   Suppose If we substitute into the function , we have In order to evaluate this, we need to know if the input to the unit step function, , is positive or negative. Since we know that is positive, and therefore   Suppose now that If we substitute into the function , we have Since we know that the input to the unit step function, , is negative, and therefore                  This result is consistent with our understanding of shifting functions. That is, if we want to sketch the graph of the function then we can shift the graph of three units to the right. Another way to think about this is that the function changes its behavior at (in that its output is 0 when the input variable is less than 3 and its output is 1 when the input variable is greater than 3).  Using this same line of thinking, if we can surmise that changes behavior at .   Sketch the function     Based on our knowledge of unit step functions, we know that changes behavior at    If we choose -values such that : then is negative, so and therefore    If we choose -values such that : then is positive, so and therefore     Thus, we can sketch the function as shown below.       Let's reflect on what happened. For the function the 2 indicates that the function changes behavior at and the 3 changes the amplitude of the nonzero portion of the function.  Move turning on  Another useful way to think about unit step functions is to think about them as being on or off. For example, has a value of zero, or is 'turned off', when , and when  has a value of 1, or is 'turned on'. Framing unit step functions this way may be helpful as we move forward and consider more complicated functions.   Sketch the function and write it as a piecewise defined function.    We can begin by identifying -values where the function changes behavior. We know that changes behavior at and changes behavior at so will change behavior at both and These -values break the -number line into three regions: (1) , (2) and (3)        If we choose -values such that (red):   is negative, so  is negative, so    How about this for formatting the analysis?

The piecewise defined function representation of is     What lessons can we take away from this example? When both of the unit step functions are 'turned off', so the only thing contributing to the function is the constant term, At the first unit step function, 'turns on', and the result is a jump discontinuity in the graph of the function at and the function jumps from a value of to a value of   The function changes behavior next at , when the function 'turns on' and therefore the function jumps from the previous value of to its final value of    Consider the function .  evaluate  evaluate  evaluate  Sketch the graph of  Write as a piecewise defined function.

We can write as a piecewise defined function as follows.       Let's step back again and see what we can generalize from this example. Notice that this function had a value of for Then the unit step function became relevant, but because its coefficient was , it had the effect of 'turning off' the that was already present. It can be helpful for us moving forward to be able to think about negative coefficients as 'turning off' a function.  This is also the first example that demonstrates a non-constant coefficient. Notice that it behaves no differently than a constant coefficient; the unit step function served to turn the function on after    Sketch the function     We first identify where the function will change behavior.

Variations on the Outbreak   Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. Instead of flipping a coin, students must roll a die to determine if they have contracted the disease. If they roll a one or a two, then they become infected; otherwise, they remain disease-free.  How would you expect the data to change?  What parameter(s) change in the DE and\/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?      Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. Instead of having 8 stations, there are only three stations.  How would you expect the data to change?  What parameter(s) change in the DE and\/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?      Suppose that the original scenario is modified slightly in the following way. The number of students initially infected is 10.  How would you expect the data to change?  What parameter(s) change in the DE and\/or initial condition to account for this change, and would they increase or decrease?         Modeling Data Collection and Tasks  At least one student was infected with the incurable illness Math Excitis. Each round will consist of the following.  Students report to the station number they have been assigned for this round (station numbers are randomly generated).  If there is at least one infected person at the station, all non-infected students flip a coin.  If the coin lands heads up, the student becomes infected.  If the coin lands tails up, the student remains healthy.  The total number of infected students is recorded.    This scenario yields the following differential equation: .    Write-Up  Write a report that includes the mathematical solutions and ideas above, presented seamlessly. This should not as numbered or lettered problems, nor as a bulleted list, but as a report with an introduction to the concept, the meaning of the equations, how they are solved, and how the differential equation can be adapted in the three different scenarios - dice roll, fewer stations, more students infected initially.  At a minimum, you should do the following.  Have an introduction to the concept. This is the part where you tell the reader why this topic matters and who cares. Also, explain to the reader what is going to be in the report they are about to read.  Describe the differential equation(s), and why they represent the scenario(s).  Explain the meaning of the critical numbers.  Explain what the parameters in your model mean, and how they change if the scenario(s) change, specifically in the three scenarios (dice rolled, fewer stations, more students infected initially)  Include the math you used to get your general and particular solutions. You may hand-write this part and include it as an appendix, referring to it in the text of your paper.  Include your plot(s). Include a title, a legend, etc.  Include a summary\/conclusion.     "

In this project, you will use differential equations to model the deer population under each of the plans.   The default reaction to the deer heard is to implement no population control methods. Under this model, the deer population will grow without constraint at least in the near future. Develop an initial value problem to model the deer population. A data set with population estimates for the deer heard should be compared to your model.    Currently, hunting is not allowed inside of the park. There has been interest from several local hunters to allow for a fixed number of tags to be sold. Each tag, would allow a hunter to harvest one adult deer. In this senario, the park office would like an estimate for the number of tags to sell to keep the population constant.    Several animal rights activist groups have complained about the plan to harvest deer. Additionally, hunting has become less popular in the area in recent years. This raises conserns over the feasibility of approach 2. A potential solution is to use a birth control dart, to prevent the female deer from concieving for a year. This would change the growth rate for the deer population. The park rangers would like to know what percentage of deer should be darted to effectively control the population.    A combination of harversting and darting could also be used to control the population of deer in the park.     "

  "body": "Solving Polynomial Equations  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so Therefore,    Possible Rational Roots  There is a theorem that tells us potential fractional roots of the polynomial. If is a solution, then must be of the form . This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.        Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.  By combining these techniques, we can solve for the roots of any higher-degree polynomial. Once we have the roots, we can construct the general solution to the higher-order LHCC equation.  For a higher-order LHCC equation like: , the characteristic equation is the polynomial equation we just discussed. Finding the roots of this polynomial gives us the general solution: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.  Let's see an example to solidify these concepts.  Solving a Third-Degree Polynomial Equation   Find the general solution to the third-order LHCC equation:       First, write down the characteristic equation: . Factoring the polynomial, we get: . Therefore, the roots are .  Since we have three distinct real roots, the general solution to the LHCC equation is: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.
