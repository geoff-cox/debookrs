## Overview

**Exploring Differential Equations** is an open-access textbook designed for undergraduate courses in differential equations. It emphasizes conceptual understanding, real-world motivation, and readable explanations. The narrative combines calculus intuition with accessible workflows for solving differential equations both analytically and numerically.
