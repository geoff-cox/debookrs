  "body": "An Analogy  When you're learning something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for :       All three are equations with the same goal—finding the unknown . However, only the third equation is a differential equation because it contains a derivative.  Now, let's try solving for in each case.             In the first equation, we found that is a number, and in the second, it's a function of . But in the third equation, how do we solve for when there is a derivative attached to it? This is exactly the kind of question that differential equations aim to answer.  We'll dive deeper into solving these types of equations soon. For now, there's still plenty more to learn about the basics, so let's keep going!  Check your Understanding     Multiple-Choice, Not Randomized, One Answer stop signs  What color is a stop sign?

  "body": "Solving Polynomial Equations  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so Therefore,    Possible Rational Roots  There is a theorem that tells us potential fractional roots of the polynomial. If is a solution, then must be of the form . This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.        Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.  By combining these techniques, we can solve for the roots of any higher-degree polynomial. Once we have the roots, we can construct the general solution to the higher-order LHCC equation.  For a higher-order LHCC equation like: , the characteristic equation is the polynomial equation we just discussed. Finding the roots of this polynomial gives us the general solution: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.  Let's see an example to solidify these concepts.  Solving a Third-Degree Polynomial Equation   Find the general solution to the third-order LHCC equation:       First, write down the characteristic equation: . Factoring the polynomial, we get: . Therefore, the roots are .  Since we have three distinct real roots, the general solution to the LHCC equation is: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.
