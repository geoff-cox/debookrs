Give some statement leading to the definition....  Laplace Transform  The Laplace Transform of a function is given by given that the integral exists (i.e. the improper integral is finite).   There's a lot to unpack with this definition, but let's begin with a few examples illustrating the definition before diving into the details.As we work through the following examples, we will practice using the definition, as well as gathering facts about how the Laplace transform works. You will no doubt find the solutions to these examples a bit cumbersome We hope to draw some conclusions as we move forward that help us find the Laplace transform quickly without having to use the (admittedly somewhat cumbersome) definition every time.

So far, we have seen three examples of how to find a Laplace transform of a given function, but we have not discussed why this idea is relevant to differential equations. In the next section, we will tie these two concepts together and illustrate how Laplace transform can be used to solve a differential equation.  Before moving forward, let's conclude this section by listing out a few important take-aways from the examples of this section.  In every example, we started with a function of and after computing the Laplace transform, we ended up with a function of a new variable . A common convention is to use upper case function names for the Laplace transform of a given lower case function. For example, In this book, we will often say \" is the Laplace transform of \". This naming convention might seem unimportant, but it will be very helpful when using these Laplace transforms to solve differential equations.  The notation often used for Laplace transform involved the symbol The curly braces that accompany are not optional; they are not just grouping symbols. We use them to indicate we are taking the Laplace transform of the function within the curly braces.  The integral has two variables, and , and we integrate with respect to . You may not have done anything like this before; all we need to do is treat like a constant.  The last couple of words in the definition say, \"given that the integral exists.\" We will end up putting restrictions on the variable that make sure that the integral exists.

  "title": "Matching Forms, Part 1",
  "body": "Matching Forms, Part 1   Let's review the Laplace transform diagram to remember how we will leverage Laplace transforms to solve differential equations.  The one last piece we need in order to solve DEs is to be able to take inverse Laplace transforms. We will focus on that piece now, and in the next section we will put all of our new skills together to solve DEs using Laplace transforms.  When we take the inverse Laplace transform, we begin with a function of , say , and what we seek is a function of such that if we took the Laplace transform of , we would get . That is, we seek to un-do the the Laplace transform. The notation looks similar:   and, as with the forward Laplace transform, the curly braces are not optional. Like the forward Laplace transform, the inverse Laplace transform is also a linear transform.  In order to take inverse Laplace transforms, we will rely on the table we have been using.    Find the inverse Laplace transform of    We look in the right column of the table and determine which of the forms the given function most closely matches. In this case, the form is like , so we can find the inverse Laplace transform as follows: Thus, we have shown that     In the previous example, the function matched with one of the properties in the table exactly. This is rare, and we need to develop strategies for when the function is not an exact match.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of    When we look in the right column of the table, this one seems to line up best with ...but it's not a perfect match. If we were going to use , then would have to be 3 (because this gives us the that we have). We would have perfectly if we the numerator was but our numerator is 17. Luckily, we can use the linearity property to help. Since the 17 is not helpful to us, we can factor it out.   We have the 17 out of the way, so we are halfway done. Now we need to (carefully) get a 6 in that numerator. We will again lean on linearity, but we will also use a little trick mathematicians use from time to time: multiplying by 1. It's always safe to multiply any expression by 1 because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value of an expression. The form of 1 that will be useful here is the form as below. Thus, we have shown that      Find    Our first goal is to identify which property in the table is going to be the closest match to the expression we are given. If we look in the right hand column of the Laplace transform table, the right choice seems to be either or . The distinguishing factor between the two is whether or not we have an in the numerator. In this case, we do not, so we aim to drive toward .  Note that we don't have a perfect match with that property, so we will have to do a little manipulation, as we did in the previous example, to get our function to match up perfectly. In order for us to do that manipulation, we do need to have in mind what exactly we are aiming for. That is, do we want to make our expression like with or with ? If we think about the kind of manipulation we did in the previous example, where we multiplied by a form of 1, we might guess that it's easier to manipulate the constant in the numerator. (If we manipulate constants in the denominator, we need to worry about two terms).  If we agree that we would like to match with then we proceed using linearity in much the same way we did the previous example.      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   We aim to make this function match , as follows.     (Include level 1 exercises here)  We have shown how you can manipulate functions of to match properties in the Laplace transform table by taking advantage of the linearity of the Laplace transform. However, there are other algebraic manipulations you can (and sometimes must!) do, so we look at more examples here.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As a general guideline, you are advised to consider the denominator when determining trying to determine which property or properties in the Laplace transform table might be appropriate. In this case, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator. None of the properties in the table looks exactly the same, but and do have second-degree polynomials in the denominator. We just need to make our expression look like the form of those denominators, This entails completing the square.  Margin note: if you need to review completing the square, look HERE.      Margin note: Notice that the sign on the 4 is positive. If the sign had been negative, this would not be a perfect match with the table and we'd have to use a different strategy. See Example (insert number here).   Now that we have changed the way looks, we see that it is a perfect match with , with and Thus, we can take its inverse Laplace transform.      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As in the previous example, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, so we might try to make this expression match and\/or in the table. We begin by completing the square.   Now we have the denominator in a format so that it matches with or , but unlike the previous example, the numerator is not an exact match with either or . We note that the numerator does have an in it, so we will start by aiming to see if we can make it a match with . If we did have a perfect match with , then we would have in the numerator. Let's focus on the numerator for a moment and consider the following.   In order to make the expressions equal, what value would the have? If we distribute the three, we would have and thus it's clear that should be equal to . Let's use this to rewrite as follows.   The advantage to writing this way is that the first fraction is now a perfect match for . We need to find a perfect match for that second fraction. It looks close to , but not perfect. In order to be a perfect match for , we would need a 3 in the numerator. Luckily, we can multiply by one (in the form of in order to get a 3 in the numerator, as follows.   Now that we have done some algebraic manipulation, we are now ready to take the inverse Laplace transform.      Find    We complete the square in the denominator in the function   This does not immediately appear to match or , but we can actually write the denominator as and proceed as in the previous examples, working toward matching and .      Find    As in the previous examples, the denominator is a second-degree polynomial; therefore it is sensible for us to begin by completing the square in the denominator as we did in the previous two examples.   Take a careful look at the denominator here. It's really close to matching or , but it is not a match because of the negative sign in front of the We need to change course when this happens. Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a partial fraction decomposition.   Margin note: If you need to review partial fraction decomposition, go HERE.    We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.     In summary, when we want to take the inverse Laplace transform of a rational function with a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, we may complete the square or we may do a partial fraction decomposition. How will we know which is appropriate? Here are a few guidelines for you to consider.  Does the denominator factor in an obvious way? If so, factor the denominator and do a partial fraction decomposition if necessary.  If the denominator does not factor in an obvious way, try completing the square.  If you end up with addition outside of the parentheses, as in then you should aim to match and\/or .  If instead you end up with subtraction outside the parentheses, as in then you should factor and do a partial fraction decomposition. You may consider using the quadratic formula if the factorization is not obvious to you.  If you end up with no terms outside the parentheses, as in then use .    If you have a rational function where the denominator is of higher degree, then partial fraction decomposition should be used to break the single fraction into several simpler fractions.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of    Note that as the quadratic term in the denominator does not factor, the denominator contains an irreducible quadratic factor and a repeated linear factor. We'll proceed by simplifying this complicated fraction with a Partial Fraction Decomposition of the form   You may also consider using technology to find a partial fraction decomposition. You should get  Click here for the details.   With the partial fraction decomposition in hand, we are prepared to take the inverse Laplace transform, using the same types of algebraic manipulations demonstrated in the previous examples.      Let's review the Laplace transform diagram to remember how we will leverage Laplace transforms to solve differential equations.  The one last piece we need in order to solve DEs is to be able to take inverse Laplace transforms. We will focus on that piece now, and in the next section we will put all of our new skills together to solve DEs using Laplace transforms.  When we take the inverse Laplace transform, we begin with a function of , say , and what we seek is a function of such that if we took the Laplace transform of , we would get . That is, we seek to un-do the the Laplace transform. The notation looks similar:   and, as with the forward Laplace transform, the curly braces are not optional. Like the forward Laplace transform, the inverse Laplace transform is also a linear transform.  In order to take inverse Laplace transforms, we will rely on the table we have been using.    Find the inverse Laplace transform of    We look in the right column of the table and determine which of the forms the given function most closely matches. In this case, the form is like , so we can find the inverse Laplace transform as follows: Thus, we have shown that     In the previous example, the function matched with one of the properties in the table exactly. This is rare, and we need to develop strategies for when the function is not an exact match.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of    When we look in the right column of the table, this one seems to line up best with ...but it's not a perfect match. If we were going to use , then would have to be 3 (because this gives us the that we have). We would have perfectly if we the numerator was but our numerator is 17. Luckily, we can use the linearity property to help. Since the 17 is not helpful to us, we can factor it out.   We have the 17 out of the way, so we are halfway done. Now we need to (carefully) get a 6 in that numerator. We will again lean on linearity, but we will also use a little trick mathematicians use from time to time: multiplying by 1. It's always safe to multiply any expression by 1 because multiplying by 1 doesn't change the value of an expression. The form of 1 that will be useful here is the form as below. Thus, we have shown that      Find    Our first goal is to identify which property in the table is going to be the closest match to the expression we are given. If we look in the right hand column of the Laplace transform table, the right choice seems to be either or . The distinguishing factor between the two is whether or not we have an in the numerator. In this case, we do not, so we aim to drive toward .  Note that we don't have a perfect match with that property, so we will have to do a little manipulation, as we did in the previous example, to get our function to match up perfectly. In order for us to do that manipulation, we do need to have in mind what exactly we are aiming for. That is, do we want to make our expression like with or with ? If we think about the kind of manipulation we did in the previous example, where we multiplied by a form of 1, we might guess that it's easier to manipulate the constant in the numerator. (If we manipulate constants in the denominator, we need to worry about two terms).  If we agree that we would like to match with then we proceed using linearity in much the same way we did the previous example.      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   We aim to make this function match , as follows.     (Include level 1 exercises here)  We have shown how you can manipulate functions of to match properties in the Laplace transform table by taking advantage of the linearity of the Laplace transform. However, there are other algebraic manipulations you can (and sometimes must!) do, so we look at more examples here.   Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As a general guideline, you are advised to consider the denominator when determining trying to determine which property or properties in the Laplace transform table might be appropriate. In this case, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator. None of the properties in the table looks exactly the same, but and do have second-degree polynomials in the denominator. We just need to make our expression look like the form of those denominators, This entails completing the square.  Margin note: if you need to review completing the square, look HERE.      Margin note: Notice that the sign on the 4 is positive. If the sign had been negative, this would not be a perfect match with the table and we'd have to use a different strategy. See Example (insert number here).   Now that we have changed the way looks, we see that it is a perfect match with , with and Thus, we can take its inverse Laplace transform.      Find the inverse Laplace transform of .   As in the previous example, we have a second-degree polynomial in the denominator, so we might try to make this expression match and\/or in the table. We begin by completing the square.   Now we have the denominator in a format so that it matches with or , but unlike the previous example, the numerator is not an exact match with either or . We note that the numerator does have an in it, so we will start by aiming to see if we can make it a match with . If we did have a perfect match with , then we would have in the numerator. Let's focus on the numerator for a moment and consider the following.   In order to make the expressions equal, what value would the have? If we distribute the three, we would have and thus it's clear that should be equal to . Let's use this to rewrite as follows.   The advantage to writing this way is that the first fraction is now a perfect match for . We need to find a perfect match for that second fraction. It looks close to , but not perfect. In order to be a perfect match for , we would need a 3 in the numerator. Luckily, we can multiply by one (in the form of in order to get a 3 in the numerator, as follows.

When we study Laplace Transforms, we will frequently want to manipulate an algebraic expression to make it match a given form.  If you prefer to see a video of this example, click here   Suppose we have the expression and we think it looks much like the form It's not a perfect match, though. Based on the denominator, we might guess   Notice that this would make the denominator a perfect match, However, the numerator still isn't quite right. It would be correct if we would multiply the numerator by 5. But if we multiply the numerator by 5, we would change the expression. In order to NOT change the expression, we will instead multiply by as follows: Notice that when we multiply by , we are just multiplying by one, so we don't change the value of the expression.  Maybe write now you're wondering what the point is. Being able to use appropriate algebra to \"match\" forms is really important when we work with Laplace Transforms. Since it's really just algebra, now is a great time to practice that skill--so when we are in the middle of studying Laplace Transforms, you can just focus on the \"new\" stuff.

Another algebraic manipulation that we might consider is a partial fraction decomposition.   Margin note: If you need to review partial fraction decomposition, go HERE.    We revert to the original expression, but this time, instead of completing the square, we factor the denominator.   Since each of the factors in the denominator is a distinct linear factor, we know that the form of the partial fraction decomposition is   Our next goal is to determine the coefficients and in this equations. There are multiple ways to achieve this and we demonstrate just one here. We multiply both sides of the equation by the least common denominator, , and then expand and collect like terms, as shown.   At this point, we have a polynomial on the left hand side and a polynomial on the right hand side. The only way these can be equal to each other is if the corresponding coefficients are equal. That is, the coefficient on on the left hand side is 1, while the coefficient on on the right hand side of the equation is . Since the polynomials are equal, we know that these are equal. That is, Similarly, if we equate the constants, we have Thus, we have the following system of two linear equations in terms of two unknown variables, and .   There are many ways to solve such an equation, and you are encouraged to choose the solution technique you like the most. Here we will solve the first equation for , and then substitute into the second equation, hence we have   Remember that our goal is to take the inverse Laplace transform. Our algebraic manipulation was helpful because we took a more complex expression and rewrote it as two simpler fractions. We can now use to find the inverse Laplace transform as follows.    "

  "body": "Solving DEs via Laplace Transforms  So far we've learned the definition of Laplace transform, developed a table so that we could more easily find Laplace transforms, and then figured out how to use the table to take inverse Laplace transforms. We are finally ready to use all of this to actually solve some DEs. First, let's refer once more to the roadmap we'll use when we solve DEs using this technique.  Before we begin, we should take note of when it's appropriate to use this technique. We can use Laplace transforms to solve DEs that are linear, have constant coefficients, and for which we have initial conditions. (We can relax this last condition if we want to, but for the most part we will focus on solving initial value problems.)   Solve the following initial value problem.    We intend to use Laplace transforms to solve this IVP, but we need to verify that this is an appropriate technique. We can verify that this is  the DE is linear,  the DE has constant coefficients, and  initial conditions are .    Hence, it is appropriate to proceed with the Laplace transform solution technique. We also note that is the dependent variable and is the independent variable, so our goal is to find a function that satisfies the DE and the initial conditions.   Margin note: We could actually use the method of undetermined coefficients. You are encouraged to do this and verify that the solution is the same.   Following the diagram , we begin by taking the Laplace transform of the DE. Let's look at some of the individual pieces.  We will need to take the Laplace transform of . Keep in mind that while it is not explicitly written, we do know that is a function of , so this could be written For the first time, we will use , being careful with our naming convention.   Similarly,   We also need to be careful about taking the Laplace transform of itself. Since is our unknown function, we don't know what we get when we take its Laplace transform, The only thing we can do is use the naming convention we have established: the Laplace transform of a function is the function That is,     With these facts in mind, we proceed to take the Laplace transform of both sides of the DE, using linearity as needed.   We can use the provided initial conditions and then simplify the equation.
