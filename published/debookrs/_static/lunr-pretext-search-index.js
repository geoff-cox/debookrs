  "body": "An Analogy  When you're learning something new, it's often helpful to connect it to concepts you already know. To grasp what a differential equation is, let's first compare it to standard equations that might feel more familiar. Consider the following three equations, where we aim to solve for :       All three are equations with the same goal—finding the unknown . However, only the third equation is a differential equation because it contains a derivative.  Now, let's try solving for in each case.             In the first equation, we found that is a number, and in the second, it's a function of . But in the third equation, how do we solve for when there is a derivative attached to it? This is exactly the kind of question that differential equations aim to answer.  We'll dive deeper into solving these types of equations soon. For now, there's still plenty more to learn about the basics, so let's keep going!  Check your Understanding   Differential equations differ from standard equations in that they have     a solution    Incorrect. While this statement is generally true, it is not what makes it different from any other equation.      a variable    Incorrect. Any equation could contain a variable.      an unknown    Incorrect. Most equations contain an unknown.      a derivative    Correct! If an equation contains a derivative, it is a differential equation.      Which of the following best describes a differential equation?     An equation involving only algebraic expressions.          An equation involving functions and their derivatives.          An equation involving trigonometric functions.          An equation that changes over time.          What distinguishes a differential equation from a standard equation?     It contains an unknown variable.   Incorrect. Both standard and differential equations contain unknown variables.     It contains a derivative.   Correct! A differential equation contains one or more derivatives, which differentiates it from a standard equation.     It contains a variable.   Incorrect. Any equation could contain a variable.     "

  "body": "Order  In this section, we'll explore a key concept in differential equations known as order . Think of the order of a differential equation as the number of layers or steps you need to peel away to reveal the original function. The more layers there are, the higher the order, and usually, the more complex the equation.    The order of a differential equation refers to the highest derivative that appears in the equation. For example, if the highest derivative is the first derivative, it's called a first-order differential equation. If the highest derivative is the second derivative, it's called a second-order differential equation, and so on.     Give the order of the following differential equations:          Order = 1. This is a first-order differential equation because the highest derivative is .            Order = 3 . This is a third-order differential equation because the highest derivative is .            Order = 2 This is a second-order differential equation because the highest derivative is .        Caution, Don't Confuse Exponents with Derivatives  It's important to distinguish between exponents and derivatives.

  "body": "Linear Terms  The most informative label you can place on a differential equation is whether it is linear or nonlinear. While linearity often refers to equations that graph as straight lines, the concept of linearity in differential equations is more nuanced. Understanding this distinction is crucial as it significantly influences how the equations are solved and interpreted.  Before jumping in, it may be helpful to revisit meaning of dependent variables, terms and coefficients as we will be referencing them throughout this discussion.  Now, let's define what it means for a term in a differential equation to be linear.  Linear Term    Linear Term  A term that has one of the forms     where is the dependent variable.

  "title": "Linearity",
  "body": "Linearity  In the world of differential equations, distinguishing between linear and nonlinear equations is vital. This distinction will often guide you on how to approach solving the equation and what methods to use. The good news is, all the work we did in the previous section will make this task much easier.   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear terms. That is, it can be expressed as If just one of the terms in the equation is nonlinear, then the entire differential equation is nonlinear .   This definition might seem abstract at first, but it encompasses all possible linear differential equations. In practice, most equations you'll encounter will involve only a few terms, and the challenge lies in identifying whether any of those terms break the rule of linearity. If they do, the equation is nonlinear.   Let's determine whether the following differential equation is linear:   To classify this equation, we need to verify if every term involving and its derivatives is linear. Let's break it down term by term:   Since each term involving or its derivatives is linear, this differential equation is indeed linear.    In summary, recognizing whether a differential equation is linear or nonlinear will help you determine the appropriate methods for solving it. Linear equations allow for a more straightforward approach, while nonlinear equations often require specialized techniques.  Check your Understanding  The differential equation is linear   True  Correct!

They describe how quantities change over time or space.     An Analogy   Like standard equations, differential equations aim to solve for an unknown, but this unknown is a function rather than a number.     Dependent & Independent Variables   Differential equations involve both dependent (unknown function) and independent variables.  The derivatives in the equation apply to the dependent variable.     Terms & Coefficients   Terms in a differential equation are separated by , , or signs.  Coefficients are constants or functions that multiply the dependent variable or its derivatives.     Order of a Differential Equation   The order of a differential equation is determined by the highest derivative present.     Linearity of a Differential Equation   A differential equation is linear if it contains only linear combinations of the dependent variable and its derivatives.  Otherwise, it is nonlinear.

  "body": "Solving Polynomial Equations  Higher-degree polynomial equations have the form and it turns out that these equations can always be factored into simpler polynomials. In particular, a polynomial of degree can always be factored into linear factors: where are the solutions and can be real or complex. This fact is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.   A \"complex\" solution is one that can contain (imaginary part).  For example, the equation has two complex solutions since   While knowing this is powerful, the process of factoring them can be quite challenging. However, there are some special forms and strategies that can help. A few are summarized below.  Techniques for Solving Higher-Degree Polynomials    Recognizing Special Forms  Some polynomials can be factored using special patterns. Common forms include:  Common Factoring:  Difference of Squares:  Sum\/Difference of Cubes:  Recognizing these forms can help simplify the factorization process.   Known Factors  If you know one factor, then you can divide-out the polynomial by this factor. For example, suppose we know that is a root of the polynomial . Then, we know that is a factor, so where is some second-degree polynomial you multiply by to get our original polynomial. We can find by dividing both sides by , like so Therefore,    Possible Rational Roots  There is a theorem that tells us potential fractional roots of the polynomial. If is a solution, then must be of the form . This gives us a list of possible solutions to test. For example, if we have the polynomial then the possible factors of are and the possible factors of are . Therefore, the possible fractional solutions are We can test each of these values to find up to 3 solutions. Once we find one, we can use the previous technique to help find more.   Use Technology  Factoring higher-order polynomials can be very difficult to do by and this is one skill that may be better suited for a computer. There are many software packages that can factor polynomials for you. For example, the Wolfram Alpha website will do it with ease.        Completely factor and solve the following characteristic equations                           The degree of each equation tells you how many factors you should have.            difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions                difference of squares     solutions                common factor      standard quadratic factoring     solutions                common factor     solutions      Technically, and represents 4 repeated factors.              common factor      difference of squares     solutions                common factor      difference of squares     solutions                difference of squares      difference of squares     set each factor to 0     solutions          An important concept to remember is that any polynomial can be factored into the product of linear factors, allowing for complex solutions. This is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. However, factoring higher-degree polynomials can sometimes be challenging and may require the use of technology, such as computer algebra systems or graphing calculators, to find complex or irrational roots.  By combining these techniques, we can solve for the roots of any higher-degree polynomial. Once we have the roots, we can construct the general solution to the higher-order LHCC equation.  For a higher-order LHCC equation like: , the characteristic equation is the polynomial equation we just discussed. Finding the roots of this polynomial gives us the general solution: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.  Let's see an example to solidify these concepts.  Solving a Third-Degree Polynomial Equation   Find the general solution to the third-order LHCC equation:       First, write down the characteristic equation: . Factoring the polynomial, we get: . Therefore, the roots are .  Since we have three distinct real roots, the general solution to the LHCC equation is: , where are constants determined by initial conditions.
