<title>Piecewise and Unit Step Functions</title>
	
	<p>
		In the previous section, we were learning the definition of unit step function and finding a piecewise defined formula for the function. This was an important step for us as we got used to unit step functions, but we what we really need is to be able to do the opposite of what we have been doing in the previous section: when given a piecewise defined function, we need to be able to write the function in terms of unit step functions. Once we have this skill, we will focus on taking Laplace transforms involving unit step functions, which we will need when we solve DEs.

	<example xml:id="ex_sketch_write_f_as_pw_func">
		<p>
			Sketch the function 
			<me>
				f(t) = \left\{ 
				\begin{array}{ll}
					e^t,	\amp t \lt 1,\\
					t^3	\amp t \ge 1,
				\end{array} \right.
			</me>
			and then write the function in terms of unit step functions.
		</p>

		<p>
			(include a sketch of the function here)
		</p>

		<p/>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first thing we want to take note of is for what <m>t</m>-values the function changes behavior. This function changes behavior at <m>t = 1,</m> and we will use a unit step function to help us capture that change in behavior, so we need a unit step function that has a discontinuity at <m>t = 1.</m> That is, we know we need at <m>U(t-1).</m> Thus, the form of our function is
				<me> f(t) = <fillin>{50}</fillin> + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t-1). </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Now we need only determine what goes in the blanks. When <m>t \lt 1,</m> the unit step function <m>U(t-1)</m> will have a value of zero. We also know that when <m>t \lt 1,</m> <m>f(t) = e^t.</m> Therefore the first blank must be <m>e^t.</m> That is,
				<me> f(t) = e^t + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t-1). </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				When <m>t>1,</m> <m>U(t-1) = 1,</m> and <m>f(t) = t^3.</m> Thus we have
				<md>
					<mrow>t \gt 1:	f(t)	\amp= e^t + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot 1</mrow>
					<mrow>t^3	\amp= e^t + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot 1</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				In order to make the equation true, it must be that the function that goes in the line is <m>-e^t + t^3,</m> so that we have
				<me> f(t) = e^t + (-e^t + t^3)\cdot U(t-1). </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				This makes sense because when <m>t = 1,</m> we "turn off" the <m>e^t</m> function and "turn on" the <m>t^3</m> function.
			</p>
		</solution>
	</example>
	

	<example xml:id="ex_write_h_as_">
		<p>
			Write the function
			<me>
				h(t) = \left\{ 
				\begin{array}{ll}
					4,	\amp t \lt 3,\\
					t - 2,	\amp 3 \le t \lt 5,\\
					7,	\amp t \ge 5
				\end{array} \right.
			</me>
			terms of unit step functions.
		</p>

		<p/>
		<solution>
			<p>
				We notice that the function changes behavior at <m>t = 3</m> and <m>t = 5.</m> That means that the form of the function is
				<me> h(t) = <fillin>{50}</fillin> + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t-3) + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t - 5). </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				Based on the previous example, we see that the left-most piece of the piecewise defined function fills in the first blank, as below.
				<me> h(t) = 4 + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t-3) + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t - 5) </me>
			</p>

			<p>
				In the next blank, we need to "turn off" the previous function and turn on new function, as we see here.
				<md>
					<mrow>h(t)	\amp= 4 + \Big(-4 + (t - 2)\Big)\cdot U(t-3) + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t - 5)</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp= 4 + (t - 6)\cdot U(t-3) + <fillin>{50}</fillin>\cdot U(t - 5)</mrow>
				</md>
			</p>

			<p>
				Similarly, we use the remaining blank to "turn off" the <m>t - 2</m> function and "turn on" the <m>7</m> function.	
				<md>
					<mrow>h(t)	\amp= 4 + (t - 6)\cdot U(t-3) + \Big( -(t - 2) + 7 \Big)\cdot U(t - 5)</mrow>
					<mrow>\amp= 4 + (t - 6)\cdot U(t-3) + (-t + 9)\cdot U(t - 5)</mrow>
				</md>
