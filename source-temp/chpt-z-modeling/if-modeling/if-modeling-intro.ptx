	A local park has been havng issues with an abundance of deer. The herd of deer has been repopulating in an unconstrained manner. This has caused several issues for the local park.
	<ul>
		<li> The deer herd is particularly fond of several vulnerable native species of plants. The biodiversity inside of the park has suffered becuase of the loss of their native plants.  </li>
		<li> Deer-vehicular collisions have increased inside the park and in the surrounding towns.  </li>
		<li> Local farmers have reported record crop loss due to the deer expanding their habitat.  </li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	Due to these costly challenged, the head park ranger has hired your differential equations class to look into various population control methods.
