# UPL_StyleLog.md
Optional running style log (human-in-the-loop)

Purpose:
- prevent cross-file drift in **Audit Mode C (Style)** by tracking only ACCEPTED style rules.

How to use:
- After accepting any Mode C suggestions, add only the generalized rule here (not the whole sentence).
- Keep it short (target 10-25 bullets total). Merge duplicates.

## Accepted style rules (current)
-

## Rejected style patterns (do NOT suggest again)
-

## House readings for TTS (optional)
- dy/dt -> "d y over d t"
- f'(x) -> "f prime of x"
