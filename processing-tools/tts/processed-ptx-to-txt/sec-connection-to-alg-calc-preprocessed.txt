		To learn something new, it helps to connect it to something you already know. So let's begin by linking differential equations to algebra.
	</p>

	<p>
		Suppose you're asked to solve each of the equations for <m>y</m>:
		<me>
			y + 2 = 11,\quad y + 2t = 11,\quad y^3 + 2t = 11.
		</me>
		The goal of algebra is to determine what goes in place of <m>y</m> to make both sides equal. Instead of guessing, you learned rules for isolating <m>y</m>. Applying those rules, we find:
		<md>
			<mrow> y = 9,\quad y = 11 - 2t,\quad y^3 \amp = 11 - 2t </mrow>
			<mrow> y \amp = \left(11 - 2t\right)^{1/3} </mrow>
		</md>
	</p>

	<p>
		Now suppose you're asked to solve a new equation:
		<me>
			y' + 2t = 11.
		</me>
		As before, we isolate <m>y'</m>:
		<me>
			y' = 11 - 2t.
		</me>
		So what function has a derivative of <m>11 - 2t</m>? In other words, what goes in place of <m>y</m> to make this equation true?
	</p>

	<p>
		From calculus, you might recognize this as an anti-derivative problem. So the <m>y</m> we seek is <m>y = 11t - t^2 + C.</m>
	</p>

	<p>
		Finding this <m>y</m> is exactly what solving a differential equation aims to do. Most problems won't be quite that straightforward, but the goal is the same: find a function that fits in place of <m>y</m> and makes the equation true.
