		<title>Terms</title>

		<p>
			In math, the word term usually refers to a part of an expression that's separated by plus or minus signs. The same idea applies to differential equations.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, a term in a differential equation is just any piece of the equation separated by addition or subtraction. For example, we might have something like:
			<me>
			\text{term}\ 1 + \text{term}\ 2 - \text{term}\ 3 = \text{term}\ 4 - \text{term}\ 5.
			</me>
			This example has three terms on the left-hand side and two on the right.

			<title>Free terms</title>
			<p>
				 Think of a free term as being free of the dependent variable.
			</p>
			<p>
				 These are often called constant terms, but this can be misleading since they are allowed to contain independent variables.
			</p>
		</aside>

		<p>
			Terms in a differential equation can include the dependent variable, its derivatives, constants, or other functions of the independent variable. If a term doesn't involve the dependent variable or its derivatives, we'll call it a free term.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, consider the five-term differential equation with dependent variable, <m>y</m>:
			<me>
				\frac{3}{x} y^{(6)} + 5.3 y'' + x^2 y' + y = \frac12\ln(x)
			</me>.
			It is common to break the terms down based on the form of the dependent variable they contain. So, in terms of <m>y</m>, we have the following terms:
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Every differential equation has a free term, even if it's not written explicitly. For example, <m>y' = -3y</m> can be rewritten as <m>y' + 3y = 0</m>, where the free term is <m>0</m>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In general, any missing term can be interpreted as a zero term.

		<title>Coefficients</title>

		<p>
			A coefficient in a differential equation is a constant or a function that depends only on the independent variable, and it multiplies the dependent variable or one of its derivatives. Coefficients help determine the structure of the equation and influence which solution methods are possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, take the equation:
			<men>
				y'' - 3y' + 2y = 0,
			</men>
			the coefficients of <m>y''</m>, <m>y'</m>, and <m>y</m> are the constants <m>1</m>, <m>-3</m>, and <m>2</m>, respectively.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, coefficients don't always have to be constants. They can also be functions of the independent variable. For instance, in the equation:
			<me>
				t^2 y'' + 5t y' + 6y = \sin(t),
			</me>
			the coefficients are the following functions of <m>t</m>:
		</p>

		<p>
			In general, for something to be considered a coefficient, it must not involve the dependent variable.
