	<title>Differential Equation Definition</title>

	<p>
		Essentially, a differential equation is any equation where the unknown has a derivative applied to it. Here's the formal definition.
	</p>

		<title>Differential Equation</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				A differential equation (DE) is an equation that involves one or more derivatives of an unknown function.
				If the function depends on a single variable, it's called an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
				If the function depends on more than one variable, it's called a partial differential equation (PDE).
			</p>

		<p>
			 Since this course only covers ordinary differential equations,	any time we say differential equation or DE, we mean ODE.

		So, for an equation to qualify as a differential equation, it must include two things:
		First, it needs a derivative—something like <m>f'</m> or <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>.
		Second, it must have an equals sign.
	</p>

	<p>
		That means all of the following are differential equations:
		<me>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 1 = y, \qquad f^{\prime\prime} + x^2 + 3x = 19, \qquad e^t = \tan(y^\prime).
		</me>
		On the other hand, these are not differential equations—either because they don't contain a derivative, or because they don't include an equals sign:

		<me>
			\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2\frac{dy}{dx}, \qquad \sin y + e^x = 0
		</me>
	</p>

		<title>Common Derivative Notations</title>

		<p>
			In this text, we'll use several common notations for derivatives. These include prime notation, like <m>y'</m> or <m>y''</m>; Leibniz notation, using <m>\frac{dy}{dx}</m>; and dot notation, which is typically reserved for derivatives with respect to time.

			<title>Notation</title>
			<p>
				 Be careful not to mistake <m>y^{(4)}</m> as <m>y</m> raised to the power of 4.
			</p>
			<p>
				 Dot notation is normally reserved for derivatives with respect to time.
