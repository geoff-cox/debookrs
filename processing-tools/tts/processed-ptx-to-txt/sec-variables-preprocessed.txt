	<title>Dependent &amp; Independent Variables</title>

	<p>
		Every differential equation involves two kinds of variables: a dependent variable and an independent variable. The dependent variable is the unknown function we're solving for. It depends on the independent variable and always has derivatives applied to it with respect to that independent variable.
	</p>

	<p>
		For example, consider the equation:
		<men>
			\frac{dy}{dx} + 2y = 4x^2.
		</men>
		Here, we're solving for <m>y</m>, which makes it the dependent variable. Since we're taking the derivative of <m>y</m> with respect to <m>x</m>, <m>x</m> is the independent variable.
	</p>

	<p>
		Identifying the dependent variable not only tells us what we're solving for, but it will also help determine which methods we can use to solve the equation.
	</p>

	<example>
		<title>Identify the Variables</title>
		<statement>
			<p>
				Identify the dependent and independent variable in each equation:
				<me>
					\frac{dP}{ds} + \frac{P}{s^2} = 17s,\qquad
					u'' + t^2 u = 0,\qquad
					Q'' = 11Q
				</me>
				
			</p>
		</statement>
		<solution>
			<p>
				The first equation contains <m>P</m> and <m>s</m>, but the presence of <m>dP/ds</m> implies <m>P</m> changes as <m>s</m> changes. So,
				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>P</m> is the unknown function we solve for that depends on <m>s</m>.</li>
					<li>dependent variable <m>\rightarrow P</m> , independent variable <m>\rightarrow s</m> .</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				The middle equation contains <m>u</m> and <m>t</m>, but <m>u''</m> is the second derivative of <m>u</m>. So, <m>u</m> must change as <m>t</m> changes and
				<ul marker="square">
					<li><m>u</m> is the unknown function we solve for that depends on <m>t</m>.</li>
					<li>dependent variable <m>\rightarrow u</m> , independent variable <m>\rightarrow t</m> .</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
		
			<p>
				Only <m>Q</m> appears in the last equation, but <m>Q''</m> indicates that <m>Q</m> is changing and so it must be the dependent variable. Typically, the independent variable will be clear from context of the problem, but in this case just assume whatever variable you like.
